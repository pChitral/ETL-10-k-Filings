BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, high-end consumers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs, direct to end users and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-PC platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. Our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Accordingly, our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events and may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2008 During fiscal 2008, our software and technologies continued to redefine how people engage with ideas and information—anytime, anywhere and through virtually any medium. Given our solid execution during the year, we were able to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth when compared to the previous year. 49 TABLE OF CONTENTS In our Creative Solutions segment, revenue increased by nine percent during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, based on continued adoption of our CS3 family of products during the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, as well as the release of our new CS4 family of products which began shipping in the fourth quarter of the year. Consisting of six Creative Suite editions and thirteen individual creative products, our CS4 family of products launch was the largest in our more than 25-year history. Although reviews and market commentary about our new CS4 family of products were overwhelmingly positive, we believe revenue from the fourth quarter launch was significantly impacted by the global financial crisis that is affecting demand in the creative professional end user market. Helping to drive the growth we achieved in our Creative Solutions business was a thirteen percent growth with our professional digital imaging products during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, we achieved strong growth in our Scene7 business. Revenue increased by more than twenty percent with our digital imaging and digital video hobbyist markets with the introduction of new versions of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products during the fourth quarter. Business Productivity Solutions achieved greater than fifteen percent increase in revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. This success was driven by continued adoption of our Acrobat 8 family of products, as well as adoption of its successor, Acrobat 9, which was released in the third quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, our execution in driving our enterprise business with our LiveCycle product family resulted in more than a thirty percent increase in revenue in this business during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, with revenue exceeding $250 million. We also continued to grow our Acrobat Connect Pro business which provides real-time collaboration capabilities via the Web utilizing our Adobe Flash Player. Our Mobile and Device Solutions segment achieved greater than 100% growth during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the ongoing success we have had targeting mobile operators, handset manufacturers and consumer electronic device manufactures with our Flash Lite technology. On May 1, 2008, we announced the Open Screen Project. The project aims to enable a consistent runtime environment that will remove barriers for developers and designers as they publish content and applications across desktops and consumer devices, including phones, mobile Internet devices (“MIDs”) and set top boxes. As part of the project, we will be removing some restrictions on the use of some of our technology specifications and publishing several technology protocols. We will also be removing the license fees on the next major releases of Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR for devices. Accordingly, we expect revenue from Mobile and Device Solutions to decrease beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We would expect this decrease to be offset in time by an increased demand for tooling products, server technologies, services and applications. In our other segments, revenue increased by fifteen percent compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to higher revenue with our Platform business and the sustaining of revenue in our legacy Print and Publishing business. Revenue Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Product $ 3,396.5 12 % $ 3,019.5 22 % $ 2,484.7 Percentage of total revenue 95 % 96 % 96 % Services and support 183.4 33 % 138.4 53 % 90.6 Percentage of total revenue 5 % 4 % 4 % Total revenue $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 23 % $ 2,575.3 In fiscal 2008, we categorized our products into the following segments: Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Mobile and Device Solutions, Platform and Print and Publishing products. Our Creative Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of creative and developer tasks to an extended set of customers. Our Knowledge Worker segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them reliably share information and collaborate effectively. This segment contains revenue generated by the Adobe Acrobat family of products. Our Enterprise segment provides server-based enterprise interaction solutions that automate people-centric processes and contains revenue generated by our LiveCycle line of products. The Mobile and Device Solutions segment provides solutions that create 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS compelling experiences through rich content, user interfaces and data services on mobile and non-PC devices such as cellular phones, consumer devices and Internet connected hand-held devices. The Platform segment provides developer solutions and technologies, including Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR and Flex Builder which are used to build rich application experiences. Finally, the Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing, to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. We will adjust our reporting segments at the beginning of fiscal 2009 to reflect changes in how we manage our business as we enter the new fiscal year. We are combining our former Mobile and Device Solutions segment with our Platform segment. These segment reporting changes reflect changes we have made internally in terms of how we manage these businesses. Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Segment Information Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Creative Solutions $ 2,072.8 9 % $ 1,899.0 32 % $ 1,438.0 Percentage of total revenue 58 % 60 % 56 % Knowledge Worker 810.9 11 % 728.5 11 % 657.8 Percentage of total revenue 23 % 23 % 26 % Enterprise 253.0 32 % 191.3 21 % 158.2 Percentage of total revenue 7 % 6 % 6 % Mobile and Device Solutions 113.1 115 % 52.5 40 % 37.5 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 2 % 1 % Platform 118.5 46 % 80.9 19 % 68.1 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 3 % 3 % Print and Publishing 211.6 3 % 205.7 (5 )% 215.7 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 8 % Total revenue $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 23 % $ 2,575.3 Fiscal 2008 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased $173.8 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products, as well as the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year. We also achieved solid growth in our Scene7 business and with our hobbyist products. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was an increase in certain unit average selling prices. Units sold remained relatively stable. Revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment increased $82.4 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in the licensing of our Acrobat 8 and new Acrobat 9 family of products. An increase in the number of units sold as well as a slight increase in certain unit average selling prices also contributed to higher revenue as compared to fiscal 2007. Revenue from our Enterprise segment increased $61.7 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increased adoption of our LiveCycle family of products and a larger number of enterprise solution transactions at a higher average transaction size. Revenue from our Mobile and Device Solutions segment increased by $60.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to continued adoption of Flash Lite by mobile and non-PC device manufacturers. On May 1, 2008, we announced the Open Screen Project. The project aims to enable a consistent runtime environment that will remove barriers 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS for developers and designers as they publish content and applications across desktops and consumer devices, including phones, MIDs and set top boxes. See Overview of 2008 for further information regarding the Open Screen Project. Platform revenue increased by $37.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased revenue related to Flash Player and the launch of Adobe AIR which resulted in increased revenue from our developer tools. Revenue in our Print and Publishing business increased by $5.9 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, driven by ongoing adoption of our eLearning solutions as well as some of our legacy print and publishing products. Fiscal 2007 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased $461.0 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the launch of the English versions of our CS3 family of products in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and the release of localized versions of our CS3 family of products during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was also due to an increase in certain unit average selling prices. Increases in revenue were offset in part, by a slight decrease in the number of units sold. Revenue from our Knowledge Worker segment increased $70.7 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in the licensing of our new Acrobat 8 family of products. The number of units sold as well as the average unit selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Enterprise segment increased $33.1 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to continued adoption of our LiveCycle family of products. Revenue also increased due to a larger number of enterprise solution transactions offset with a decrease in the average transaction size during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Mobile and Device Solutions segment increased $15.0 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to continued adoption of Flash Lite by mobile and non-PC device manufacturers, and our Flash Cast solutions by mobile operators. Revenue from our Platform segment increased $12.8 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to increased revenue related to Flash Player. Revenue from our Print and Publishing segment decreased $10.0 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to lower revenue associated with some of our legacy products. Geographic Information Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Americas $ 1,632.8 8 % $ 1,508.9 19 % $ 1,266.7 Percentage of total revenue 46 % 48 % 49 % EMEA 1,229.2 20 % 1,026.4 33 % 770.1 Percentage of total revenue 34 % 32 % 30 % Asia 717.9 15 % 622.6 16 % 538.5 Percentage of total revenue 20 % 20 % 21 % Total revenue $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 23 % $ 2,575.3 Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2008 increased compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products during the first half of the year, the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of the year, the launch of our Acrobat 9 family of products in the third quarter of the year and strong growth in our enterprise business. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $69.3 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, during fiscal 2008 we had a hedging gain of 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS $13.2 million. Revenue in Asia was favorably impacted by approximately $39.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar. Fiscal 2007 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2007 increased compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the launch of the English versions of our CS3 family of products in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the release of the localized versions of our CS3 family of products during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and success with our Acrobat 8 family of products. Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the launch of the English versions of our CS3 family of products during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased revenue from the Acrobat 8 family of products. Revenue in EMEA increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the release of localized versions of our CS3 family of products and increases in revenue from the Acrobat Pro products. Additionally, revenue in EMEA increased approximately $65.9 million due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Revenue in Asia increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the release of localized versions of our CS3 family of products. Changes in the Yen over the U.S. dollar did not have a significant impact to revenue in Asia during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk regarding foreign currency risks. Product Backlog With regard to our product backlog, the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal backlog at the end of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008. The comparable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was approximately 7% of fourth quarter fiscal 2007 revenue. Cost of Revenue Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Product $ 266.4 (2 )% $ 270.8 20 % $ 226.5 Percentage of total revenue 7 % 9 % 9 % Services and support 96.2 15 % 83.9 27 % 66.0 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 3 % 3 % Total cost of revenue $ 362.6 2 % $ 354.7 21 % $ 292.5 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue increased (decreased) due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Amortization of acquired rights to use technology 6 % 8 % Royalties for licensed technologies 3 7 Localization costs related to our product launches (1 ) 10 Excess and obsolete inventory (1 ) 3 Amortization of purchased technology (10 ) (11 ) Various individually insignificant items 1 3 Total change (2 )% 20 % 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS Amortization of acquired rights to use technology increased primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Royalty costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of licensed technology agreements during the year coupled with royalty costs associated with a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Localization costs which are amortized over the product life cycle, decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to increased costs during fiscal 2007 associated with the release of the localized versions of our CS3 family of products and the Acrobat 8 family of products. Amortization of purchased technology decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, due to a decrease in amortization primarily associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition at the beginning of fiscal 2006. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by increases in headcount related to product support and utilization by customers of our consulting services. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits primarily as a result of headcount increases and increases in costs to support consulting engagements and product releases. Operating Expenses Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses Included in compensation costs for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 are compensation and related benefits, including stock-based compensation costs as a result of adopting SFAS 123R at the beginning of fiscal 2006. The increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 related to increases in headcount and stock-based compensation offset by decreases in profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Additionally, the increase in compensation for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 related to higher expense for profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Research and Development Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 662.1 8 % $ 613.2 14 % $ 539.7 Percentage of total revenue 18 % 19 % 21 % Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS Research and development expenses increased due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 7 % 9 % Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation — 5 Various individually insignificant items 1 — Total change 8 % 14 % We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remaining competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 1,089.3 11 % $ 984.4 14 % $ 867.1 Percentage of total revenue 30 % 31 % 34 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 5 % 3 % Marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenue 4 2 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 1 6 Various individually insignificant items 1 3 Total change 11 % 14 % General and Administrative Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 337.3 23 % $ 275.0 17 % $ 234.6 Percentage of total revenue 9 % 9 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance. 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS General and administrative expenses increased due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology 6 % — % Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 4 3 Charitable contributions 4 — Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 2 8 Professional and consulting fees 2 2 Provision for bad debt 2 — Depreciation and amortization 1 2 Various individually insignificant items 2 2 Total change 23 % 17 % Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology increased primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Charitable contributions represent funding of the Adobe Foundation which is a private foundation created to leverage human, technological and financial resources to drive social change and improve the communities in which we live and work. Restructuring Charges Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 32.1 * $ 0.6 (97 )% $ 20.3 Percentage of total revenue 1 % * 1 % _________________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities impacting a total of approximately 560 full-time positions globally. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of these full-time positions globally. As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we expect to record approximately $10.0 million to $13.0 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately 100 of the remaining full-time positions globally. We expect to pay this facility related liability through fiscal 2013. Charges associated with these ongoing termination benefits were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 112, “Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,” and expected charges associated with the consolidation of leased facilities will be recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS Macromedia Restructuring Charges We acquired Macromedia on December 3, 2005 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, pursuant to Board of Directors’ approval, implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate approximately 313 positions held by Adobe employees worldwide, which impacted all functional areas. The reduction in force was completed in fiscal 2006. The restructuring plan also included costs related to the world-wide consolidation of facilities, the cancellation of certain contracts and the write-off of fixed assets located at facilities that have been vacated. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of $2.9 million related to changes in estimates related to Macromedia facilities restructuring charges due to changes in sub-lease income estimates. Additionally, we have a $13.1 million liability for restructuring as of November 28, 2008 primarily associated with the Macromedia restructured facilities. We expect to pay this liability through fiscal 2011. See Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring charges. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Incomplete Technology Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 68.2 (6 )% $ 72.4 4 % $ 69.9 Percentage of total revenue 2 % 2 % 3 % As a result of our acquisition of Macromedia in fiscal 2006, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we completed one business combination and during fiscal 2007, we completed two business combinations and one asset acquisition. We acquired purchased intangibles through these acquisitions which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition. Additionally, included in the amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology for fiscal 2007 was $1.5 million related to the write-off of in-process research and development from an acquisition that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Non-operating Income Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Interest and other income, net $ 43.8 (47 )% $ 82.7 23 % $ 67.3 Percentage of total revenue 1 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense (10.0 ) * (.2 ) 100 % (.1 ) Percentage of total revenue * * * Investment gains and (losses), net 16.4 131 % 7.1 (88 )% 61.2 Percentage of total revenue * % * % 2 % Total non-operating income $ 50.2 (44 )% $ 89.6 (30 )% $ 128.4 _________________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Interest and Other Income, net Interest and other income, net, included interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen currencies. Interest and other income, net, decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested balances due to cash used for our share repurchase programs, lower interest rates and increased hedging costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, interest and other income, net included losses on fixed income investments associated 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS with a write-down for an other-than-temporary impairment totaling approximately $1.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Interest and other income, net increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of higher rates of return on invested cash and short-term investments. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2008, primarily represents interest associated with our credit facility. The outstanding balance as of November 28, 2008 was $350.0 million. Interest due under the credit facility is paid upon expiration of the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) contract or at a minimum, quarterly. Investment Gains and (Losses), net Investment gains and (losses), net consist principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and gains and losses associated with our interests in Adobe Ventures. Investment gains and (losses), net fluctuated due to the following: 2008 2007 2006 Net gains (losses) related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ 15.9 $ 6.9 $ (6.5 ) Gains from sale of equity investments 5.4 0.2 67.9 Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (4.9 ) — — Losses on stock warrants — — (0.2 ) Total investment gains and (losses), net $ 16.4 $ 7.1 $ 61.2 During fiscal 2008, investment gains and (losses), net increased as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to investment gains from our direct and Adobe Ventures investments. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, we received cash and recognized a gain resulting from the expiration of the escrow period related to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Investment gains and (losses), net increased in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2007 due to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Provision $ 206.7 (7 )% $ 223.4 28 % $ 173.9 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 7 % 7 % Effective tax rate 19 % 24 % 26 % Our effective tax rate decreased approximately five percentage points during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily related to the completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004, a refund of foreign taxes from our fiscal years 2000 through 2002 following a foreign tax court judgment and stronger international profits for fiscal 2008 offset in part by an increase due to the tax benefit for the reinstatement of the research and development credit relating to fiscal 2006 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rate decreased approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2006. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2006. A $12.3 million cumulative tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2006 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows. Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 2,019.2 $ 1,993.9 Working capital 1,972.5 1,720.4 Stockholders’ equity $ 4,410.4 $ 4,650.0 Summary of our cash flows is as follows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,280.7 $ 1,441.1 $ 900.0 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities (304.7 ) 81.5 195.2 Net cash used for financing activities (1,021.6 ) (1,350.4 ) (747.4 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (14.4 ) 1.7 3.9 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (60.0 ) $ 173.9 $ 351.7 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses; general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent; and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008, was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, deferred revenue and trade payables. Increases in deferred revenue related to maintenance and support and free of charge upgrade plan purchases which offset in part, decreases in deferred revenue related to royalties. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in income taxes payable, accrued expenses and accrued restructuring costs. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of high sales of our CS4 family of products at the end of fiscal 2008. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments made as the result of the completion of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and profit sharing offset in part by increases in royalty accruals and charitable contributions. Accrued restructuring costs increased due to the restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 offset in part by payments of facility costs during fiscal 2008 associated with the Macromedia acquisition. See Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2007, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, accrued expenses, income taxes payable, deferred revenue and trade payables coupled with decreases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net changes in accrued expenses was primarily attributable to increases in accrued bonuses and accrued localization costs related to the localization of our CS3 family of products during fiscal 2007. Income taxes payable increased due to overall increased taxable income. Increases to deferred revenue related primarily to deferred maintenance and service revenue due to strong upgrade plan sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for our CS3 family of products and related individual creative products. The decrease in trade receivables was due to collections in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to high Acrobat 8 sales at the end of fiscal 2006 and strong collections during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 resulting from shipments of our CS3 family of products. The primary working capital use of cash was a decrease in accrued restructuring costs which was primarily due to payments for facility and severance costs for fiscal 2007. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS Net cash provided by operating activities of $900.0 million for fiscal 2006, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher current tax liabilities related to overall increased taxable income. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in accrued restructuring costs and accrued expenses. Trade receivables increased due to increased revenue. Accrued restructuring decreased due to payments made during fiscal 2006. Net changes to accrued expenses was attributable primarily to decreases in compensation related costs and other expenses. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash from investing activities changed from cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $81.5 million to cash used in fiscal 2008 of $304.7 million primarily due to purchases of short-term investments offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2008 represented purchases of property and equipment, long-term investments and other assets and one business combination offset in part by proceeds from the sale of other investments in equity securities. The uses associated with the purchase of long-term investments and other assets related primarily to cash paid for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $56.0 million in fiscal 2008. As part of our lease extension for the Almaden Tower lease completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we purchased a portion of the lease receivable totaling $80.4 million. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included the completion of two business combinations and one asset acquisition. Net cash from investing activities decreased from net cash provided for fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million to net cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $81.5 million. In fiscal 2006, net cash acquired with the Macromedia acquisition amounted to $488.4 million and the sale of our minority equity investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. amounted to $82.3 million. No similar transactions of this magnitude occurred during fiscal 2007. The primary sources of cash during fiscal 2007 were sales and maturities of short-term investments offset in part by purchases of short-term investments. The proceeds from the sales of short-term investments were primarily used for stock repurchases. Uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets which related primarily to the technology licensing arrangements that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, three acquisitions completed in fiscal 2007 and the purchase of the lease receivable associated with the Almaden tower lease. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this lease extension. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used for financing activities decreased $328.8 million for a total of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2008 as compared to cash used for the same period last year, primarily due to net borrowings under our credit agreement of $350.0 million. Additionally, we had lower purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year (see sections entitled “Stock Repurchase Program I” and “Stock Repurchase Program II” discussed below), offset in part by lower proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock. Net cash used for financing activities increased $603.0 million for a total of $1.4 billion during fiscal 2007 as compared to cash used of $747.4 million during fiscal 2006. Increases were primarily due to additional purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year. Cash used for stock repurchases increased due to a higher average cost per share, a greater number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements. (See the following sections titled “Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II” discussed below). We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. The Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. As previously disclosed, we plan to invest $100.0 million directly in venture capital, of which, approximately $33.5 million has already been invested. We expect the remaining balance to be invested over the next three to five years. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities impacting a total of approximately 560 full-time positions globally. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of these full-time positions globally. As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we expect to record approximately $10.0 million to $13.0 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately 100 of the remaining full-time positions globally. We expect to pay this facility related liability through fiscal 2013. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2009 in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we also increased our existing $500.0 million credit facility to $1.0 billion. The purpose of the credit facility is to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes including stock repurchases. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our credit agreement. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 65% of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Within the U.S., the portfolio is invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. As part of this program, on April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of an additional $1.0 billion for stock repurchases commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. This additional $1.0 billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $525.0 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 22.4 million shares at an average price of $36.26 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $40.04 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average price of $36.41 in open market transactions. 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS For fiscal 2008 and 2007, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007 were excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of November 28, 2008 under this program will expire on or before March 19, 2009. As of November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007, approximately $134.7 million and $422.6 million, respectively, of up-front payments remained under the agreements. See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 28, 2008. Stock Repurchase Program II Under this stock repurchase program, we had authorization to repurchase an aggregate of 50.0 million shares of our common stock. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the remaining authorized number of shares were repurchased. From the inception of the 50.0 million share authorization under this program, we provided prepayments of $1.9 billion under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 31.9 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $37.15. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 17.7 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $40.50 and approximately $133.7 million of up-front payments remained under these agreements as of November 30, 2007. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 0.5 million shares at an average price of $39.79 in open market transactions.

(2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See “Stock Repurchase Program I” and “Stock Repurchase Program II” above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 28, 2008, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments. 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of November 28, 2008: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Total non-cancellable operating leases $ 229.2 $ 49.2 $ 60.9 $ 34.7 $ 84.4 Total purchase commitments 145.9 111.1 15.7 4.6 14.5 Total debt 350.0 — — 350.0 — Total $ 725.1 $ 160.3 $ 76.6 $ 389.3 $ 98.9 As of November 28, 2008, the principal outstanding under the credit agreement was $350.0 million which is due in full no later than February 16, 2013. Interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation. As a result of adopting FIN 48, we reclassified $197.7 million from current income taxes payable to long-term income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2008 was $139.5 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. While it is reasonably possible that some issues with the IRS and other examinations could be resolved within the next 12 months, based upon the current facts and circumstances, we cannot estimate the timing of such resolution or range of potential changes as it relates to the unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as part of our financial statements. We do not expect any material settlements in fiscal 2009 but it is inherently uncertain to determine. Two of our lease agreements and our credit agreement are subject to financial covenants. As of November 28, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we expect to remain in compliance during the next 12 months. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the leases. As of November 28, 2008, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $2.6 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments In countries outside the U.S., we transact business, in U.S. dollars and in various other currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in Euro and Yen are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts for Yen- or Euro-denominated revenue. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, our revenue exposures were 36.8 billion Yen, 35.5 billion Yen and 32.8 billion Yen, respectively. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, our revenue exposures were 628.2 million Euros, 595.5 million Euros and 504.7 million Euros, respectively. Our Japanese operating expenses are in Yen and our European operating expenses are primarily in Euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to Yen and Euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and forward contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of November 28, 2008, total outstanding contracts were $737.9 million which included the notional equivalent of $504.7 million in Euro, $189.3 million in Yen and $43.9 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of November 28, 2008, all contracts were set to expire at various times through July 2009. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition, we also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $149.1 million and $119.7 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese Yen and the Euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 28, 2008, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 28, 2008, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 28, 2008. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $47.3 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $38.7 million. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Privately-Held Long-Term Investments The privately-held companies in which we invest, can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately-held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. See Note 6 and Note 17 for information regarding our limited partnership interest in Adobe Ventures. Short-Term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 28, 2008, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $3.0 million compared to $20.8 million at November 30, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our equity holdings during fiscal 2008. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of November 28, 2008, that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another. 50 % 35 % 15 % Marketable equity securities $ (1.5 ) $ (1.0 ) $ (0.5 ) Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities At November 28, 2008, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.1 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. Due within one year $ 664.8 Due within two years 271.8 Due within three years 73.6 Due after three years 119.5 Total $ 1,129.7 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 28, 2008. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. In prior years the analysis had been performed for time periods of 6 months and 12 months. In the current year we have modified the analysis to model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. This methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values (in $ millions) of our debt securities classified as short term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007: -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/28/2008 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 1,145.8 1,142.3 1,136.4 1,129.7 1,123.0 1,116.4 1,109.9 -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/30/2007 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 1,034.1 1,031.6 1,029.1 1,026.6 1,024.1 1,021.7 1,019.3 The portfolio at 11/28/2008 was more sensitive to changes in interest rates than at 11/30/2007 due to the larger size and a greater weighted average duration (1.2 years at 11/28/2008 compared to 0.5 years at 11/30/2007). 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS",2023-12-30 17:04:55.896933

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business, Web and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, knowledge workers, consumers, OEMs, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs, direct to end users and through our own Website at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-PC platforms, depending on the product. ACQUISITION OF OMNITURE On October 23, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Omniture, an industry leader in Web analytics and online business optimization based in Orem, Utah, for approximately $1.8 billion. Accordingly, we have included the results of the business operations acquired from Omniture in our consolidated results of operations beginning on October 24, 2009. We expect the acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We expect our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future, but we also anticipate both revenue and cost saving synergies. Coinciding with the integration of Omniture, we created a new reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. We recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions, including implementation and set-up fees, ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our consulting revenue is primarily recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Accordingly, our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events and may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. Business Combinations We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: · future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; · expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; · the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and · discount rates. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined there was no impairment. We currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2009 Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, our former Mobile and Devices Solutions segment, which was integrated into our Platform business unit to better align our engineering and marketing efforts, is now reported as part of the Platform segment. Prior year information has been updated to reflect the integration of these business units. During fiscal 2009, our business was broadly impacted by the global economic recession and generally weak macro-economic environment. This resulted in a significant year-over-year decline in our revenue and earnings results. In our Creative Solutions segment, revenue decreased by 18% during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. We attribute this decline to reduced adoption of our CS4 family of products during the year, as the global financial crisis significantly affected demand in the creative professional end user market. All major creative product categories declined on a year-over-year basis. Our Business Productivity Solutions business declined 19% in fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008. A decline in demand primarily due to the macro-economic environment with our Acrobat product family – which makes up the majority of revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment – was the primary factor for this decline. In our Enterprise business, our LiveCycle revenue declined 7% when compared to revenue achieved in fiscal 2008. We attribute this smaller percentage decline in comparison to our other segments to focused execution by our sales teams and the large market opportunities these product solutions address. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS In our Platform segment, revenue declined 22% on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the impact of the OSP. The removal of license fees associated with our Flash technologies on mobile devices commenced in fiscal 2009, and as such, OEM revenue from device manufacturers began to decline from rates of revenue we achieved in fiscal 2008. We continue to expect this decline to be offset over time by an increased demand for tooling products, server technologies, services and applications in many of our other business segments. In our Print and Publishing segment, revenue was also impacted by the global macroeconomic environment, resulting in a 16% year-over-year decline. The Omniture business appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter with the improvement in the general economy, as indicated by an increase in the transaction volume on our network. In addition, customer retention rates began stabilizing and we experienced an increase in the number of subscription services provided to our existing customers. Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Product $ 2,759.4 (19 )% $ 3,396.5 12 % $ 3,019.5 Percentage of total revenue 94 % 95 % 96 % Services and support 186.5 2 % 183.4 33 % 138.4 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 5 % 4 % Total revenue $ 2,945.9 (18 )% $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 In fiscal 2009, we categorized our products into the following segments: Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Platform, Print and Publishing and Omniture products. Our Creative Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of creative and developer tasks to an extended set of customers. Our Knowledge Worker segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them reliably share information and collaborate effectively. This segment contains revenue generated by the Adobe Acrobat family of products. Our Enterprise segment provides server-based enterprise interaction solutions that automate people-centric processes and contains revenue generated by our LiveCycle line of products. The Platform segment provides developer solutions and technologies, including Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR and Flash Builder which are used to build rich application experiences in addition to solutions that create compelling experiences through rich content, user interfaces and data services on mobile and non-PC devices such as cellular phones, consumer devices and Internet connected hand-held devices. The Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing, to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. Finally, our Omniture segment provides Web analytics and online business optimization products and services. We will adjust our reporting segments at the beginning of fiscal 2010 to reflect changes in how we manage our business as we enter the new fiscal year. Specifically, we are moving responsibility for our Adobe Connect Pro product line from our Knowledge Worker segment to our Enterprise segment. Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS Segment Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Creative Solutions $ 1,702.1 (18 )% $ 2,072.8 9 % $ 1,899.0 Percentage of total revenue 58 % 58 % 60 % Knowledge Worker 623.0 (23 )% 810.9 11 % 728.5 Percentage of total revenue 21 % 23 % 23 % Enterprise 235.5 (7 )% 253.0 32 % 191.3 Percentage of total revenue 8 % 7 % 6 % Platform 181.0 (22 )% 231.6 74 % 133.4 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 4 % Print and Publishing 178.0 (16 )% 211.6 3 % 205.7 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 7 % Omniture 26.3 * % — — % — Percentage of total revenue 1 % — % — % Total revenue $ 2,945.9 (18 )% $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 _____________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Fiscal 2009 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment decreased $370.7 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to reduced adoption of our CS family of products because of the global recession and generally weak macro-economic environment. The decrease was driven largely by a 15% decline in Creative Suites related revenue and a decline of 27% in Photoshop point product revenue. Also contributing to the decrease was an overall decline in the number of units licensed. Average unit selling prices have remained relatively consistent. Revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment decreased $187.9 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 for similar reasons as Creative Solutions in addition to a decrease in the licensing of our Acrobat family of products. We attribute the decline in revenue to lower volume licensing by our enterprise customers, as well as a decrease in the number of units sold through our shrink-wrap distribution channel. Average unit selling prices have remained relatively consistent. Revenue from our Enterprise segment decreased $17.5 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the economic impact which resulted in reduced spending by our enterprise customers. Revenue from our Platform segment decreased by $50.6 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the impact of the OSP which we announced on May 1, 2008, and involves the removal of certain licensing fees of our Flash Lite client with OEMs. Revenue in our Print and Publishing business decreased by $33.6 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to reduced demand because of the global macro-economic downturn. We acquired Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and as such, there is no prior fiscal 2008 period with which to compare Omniture fiscal 2009 revenue. Fiscal 2008 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased $173.8 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products, as well as the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We also achieved solid growth in our Scene7 business and with our hobbyist products. The increase was also driven by a 7% increase in Creative Suites related revenue and an increase of 5% in Photoshop point product revenue. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was an increase in certain unit average selling prices. Units sold remained relatively stable. Revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment increased $82.4 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in the licensing of our Acrobat 8 and new Acrobat 9 family of products. An increase in the number of units sold as well as a slight increase in certain unit average selling prices also contributed to higher revenue as compared to fiscal 2007. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenue from our Enterprise segment increased $61.7 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increased adoption of our LiveCycle family of products and a larger number of enterprise solution transactions at a higher average transaction size. Revenue from our Platform segment increased by $98.2 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to continued adoption of Flash Lite by mobile and non-PC device manufacturers, as well as increased revenue related to Flash Player and the launch of Adobe AIR which resulted in increased revenue from our developer tools. Revenue in our Print and Publishing business increased by $5.9 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, driven by ongoing adoption of our eLearning solutions as well as some of our legacy print and publishing products. Geographic Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Americas $ 1,382.6 (15 )% $ 1,632.8 8 % $ 1,508.9 Percentage of total revenue 46 % 46 % 48 % EMEA 928.9 (24 )% 1,229.2 20 % 1,026.4 Percentage of total revenue 32 % 34 % 32 % Asia 634.4 (12 )% 717.9 15 % 622.6 Percentage of total revenue 22 % 20 % 20 % Total revenue $ 2,945.9 (18 )% $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 Fiscal 2009 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2009 decreased compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the global economic recession, which resulted in reduced adoption of many of our major products. Included in the overall decrease in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars decreased approximately $47.1 million, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, as compared to fiscal 2008. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue. During fiscal 2009, our currency hedging program related to the Euro resulted in hedging gains of $25.8 million. Revenue in Asia measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $32.8 million due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, our currency hedging program related to the Yen resulted in hedging gains of $1.2 million. Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2008 increased compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products during the first half of the year, the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of the year, the launch of our Acrobat 9 family of products in the third quarter of the year and strong growth in our enterprise business. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $69.3 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, during fiscal 2008 we had a hedging gain of $13.2 million. Revenue in Asia was favorably impacted by approximately $39.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk regarding foreign currency risks. Product Backlog With regard to our product backlog, the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. Our backlog for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 9% of fourth quarter fiscal 2009 revenue compared with approximately 2% of third quarter fiscal 2009 revenue. We had minimal backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS Cost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Product $ 228.9 (14 )% $ 266.4 (2 )% $ 270.8 Percentage of total revenue 8 % 7 % 9 % Services and support 67.8 (30 )% 96.2 15 % 83.9 Percentage of total revenue 2 % 3 % 3 % Total cost of revenue $ 296.7 (18 )% $ 362.6 2 % $ 354.7 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Amortization of acquired rights to use technology (8 )% 6 % Amortization of purchased intangibles (10 ) (10 ) Royalty cost (1 ) 3 Hosted services 9 3 Various individually insignificant items (4 ) (4 ) Total change (14 )% (2 )% The decrease in amortization of acquired rights to use technology primarily relates to a charge for historical use of licensing rights associated with certain technology licensing arrangements entered into in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. Amortization of acquired rights to use technology increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a decrease in amortization primarily associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition which were fully amortized during fiscal 2009. The increase in hosted service costs was primarily related to the amortization of our investment in capitalized infrastructure costs related to our SaaS business in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, due to decreases in compensation and related benefits driven by headcount reductions as well as increased consulting support provided by third- party systems integrators resulting in the downsizing of our consulting organization. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by increases in headcount related to product support and utilization by customers of our consulting services. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The decrease in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by decreases in compensation expense and a decrease in the costs associated with acquired rights to use technology. The decrease in compensation costs during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. The increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 related to increases in headcount and stock-based compensation offset by decreases in profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Research and Development Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 565.1 (15 )% $ 662.1 8 % $ 613.2 Percentage of total revenue 19 % 18 % 19 % Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.

We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 981.9 (10 )% $ 1,089.3 11 % $ 984.4 Percentage of total revenue 33 % 30 % 31 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 2 % 5 % Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation (8 ) 1 Marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenue (1 ) 4 Various individually insignificant items (3 ) 1 Total change (10 )% 11 % 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS General and Administrative Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 298.7 (11 )% $ 337.3 23 % $ 275.0 Percentage of total revenue 10 % 9 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance. General and administrative expenses decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology (5 )% 6 % Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 2 4 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation (8 ) 2 Charitable contributions (3 ) 4 Professional and consulting fees 1 2 Provision for bad debt — 2 Depreciation and amortization 1 1 Various individually insignificant items 1 2 Total change (11 )% 23 % The decrease in allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily relates to the historical use of licensing rights associated with certain technology licensing arrangements entered into in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Charitable contributions represent funding of the Adobe Foundation which is a private foundation created to leverage human, technological and financial resources to drive social change and improve the communities in which we live and work. The decrease in charitable contributions during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects a change in the timing of contributions to the Adobe Foundation.

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Charges On November 10, 2009, we initiated a restructuring plan to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan impacting up to approximately 630 full-time positions worldwide. In connection with this restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $25.5 million related to ongoing 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 340 of these full-time positions worldwide. As of November 27, 2009, approximately $2.5 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these ongoing termination benefits is expected to be paid during fiscal 2010. The restructuring activities related to this program affect only those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect to record additional restructuring charges of approximately $15 million to $18 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and up to approximately $26 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of the remaining full-time positions worldwide. We expect to accrue the facility related liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and pay these liabilities through fiscal 2021 based on current lease terms. Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures. Omniture Restructuring Charges We completed our acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a plan to restructure the pre-merger operations of Omniture to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with this restructuring plan, we accrued a total of approximately $10.6 million in costs related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 100 regular positions and for the closure of duplicative facilities. We also accrued approximately $0.2 million in costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind-down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by Omniture. These costs were recorded as a part of the purchase price allocation, as discussed in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and have been accrued for as of November 27, 2009. We expect to pay the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Additionally, approximately $1.5 million of restructuring costs related to facilities were included in the liabilities assumed by us upon our acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program, consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately 560 full-time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities, in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of the 560 full-time positions globally. As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. During fiscal 2009, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program. We vacated approximately 89,000 square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada. We accrued $8.5 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 6% as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $4.4 million. We also recorded additional charges of $6.7 million for termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining 100 full-time positions expected to be terminated. We have paid substantially all of the accrued termination benefits during fiscal 2009 and expect to pay the remaining amounts in fiscal 2010. We expect to pay facilities-related liabilities through fiscal 2013. Macromedia Restructuring Charges We completed our acquisition of Macromedia on December 3, 2005. In connection with this acquisition, we initiated plans to restructure both the pre-merger operations of Adobe and Macromedia to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with the worldwide restructuring plan, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for employee positions that were eliminated and for the closure of duplicative facilities. We also recognized costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind-down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by Macromedia. Costs for termination benefits and contract cancellations were completed during fiscal 2007. Total costs incurred were $27.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS As of November 27, 2009, accrued restructuring charges related to the 2009 restructuring program, 2008 restructuring program, Omniture acquisition, and Macromedia acquisition totaled approximately $23.0 million, $4.4 million, $12.3 million, and $5.0 million respectively. We expect to pay the liabilities associated with the 2009 and 2008 restructuring programs through fiscal 2021 and 2013, respectively. We expect to pay the restructuring liabilities associated with the Omniture and Macromedia acquisitions through fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring charges. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Incomplete Technology Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 71.6 5 % $ 68.2 (6 )% $ 72.4 Percentage of total revenue 2 % 2 % 2 % As a result of our acquisition of Omniture in fiscal 2009, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to twelve years. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of Macromedia in fiscal 2006, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years. During fiscal 2009, we completed one business combination, in addition to Omniture. During fiscal 2008 we completed one business combination and during fiscal 2007, we completed two business combinations and one asset acquisition. We acquired purchased intangibles through these acquisitions which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangibles assets purchased through the acquisition of Omniture. Amortization expense decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition. Non-Operating Income (Expense) (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Interest and other income, net $ 31.4 (28 )% $ 43.8 (47 )% $ 82.7 Percentage of total revenue 1 % 1 % 3 % Interest expense (3.4 ) 66 % (10.0 ) * (0.2 ) Percentage of total revenue * * * Investment gains (losses), net (17.0 ) (204 )% 16.4 131 % 7.1 Percentage of total revenue (1 )% * % * Total non-operating income (expense), net $ 11.0 (78 )% $ 50.2 (44 )% $ 89.6 _________________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income, net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen currencies. Interest and other income, net, decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by lower average invested balances, realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and lower foreign exchange losses. Interest and other income, net, decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested balances due to cash used for our share repurchase programs, lower interest rates and increased hedging costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, interest and other income, net included losses on fixed income investments associated with a write-down for an other-than-temporary impairment totaling approximately $1.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2009 and 2008, primarily represents interest associated with our credit facility. The outstanding balance as of November 27, 2009 was $1.0 billion. Interest due under the credit facility is paid upon expiration of the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) contract or at a minimum, quarterly. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates. Investment Gains (Losses), Net Investment gains (losses), net, consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. Investment gains and (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net gains (losses) related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ (16.7 ) $ 15.9 $ 6.9 Gains from sale of equity investments — 5.4 0.2 Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (0.3 ) (4.9 ) — Total investment gains (losses), net $ (17.0 ) $ 16.4 $ 7.1 During fiscal 2009, investment gains (losses), net decreased as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to net unrealized losses related to our Adobe Ventures and direct investments. During fiscal 2008, investment gains (losses), net increased as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to investment gains from our direct and Adobe Ventures investments. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, we received cash and recognized a gain resulting from the expiration of the escrow period related to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Provision for Income Tax es (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Provision $ 315.0 52 % $ 206.7 (7 )% $ 223.4 Percentage of total revenue 11 % 6 % 7 % Effective tax rate 45 % 19 % 24 % Our effective tax rate increased approximately twenty-six percentage points during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to a one-time charge that was related to our acquisition of Omniture. The charge was the tax cost of inter-company transactions necessary to license certain Omniture assets to Adobe’s trading companies, so that Omniture’s services can be offered to customers from Adobe companies. Our effective tax rate decreased approximately five percentage points during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily related to the completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004, a refund of foreign taxes from our fiscal years 2000 through 2002 following a foreign tax court judgment and stronger international profits for fiscal 2008 offset in part by an increase due to the tax benefit for the reinstatement of the research and development credit relating to fiscal 2006 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (in millions) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 1,904.5 $ 2,019.2 Working capital $ 1,629.1 $ 1,972.5 Stockholders’ equity $ 4,890.6 $ 4,410.4 Summary of our cash flows is as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,117.7 $ 1,280.7 $ 1,441.1 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities (1,497.1 ) (304.7 ) 81.5 Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 477.7 (1,021.6 ) (1,350.4 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 14.7 (14.4 ) 1.7 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 113.0 $ (60.0 ) $ 173.9 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses; general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent; and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). Another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is described below. Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009, was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with decreases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets and increases in income taxes payable. Trade receivables decreased primarily from CS4 revenue that was shipped in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, in addition to lower overall gross revenue and improved collections. The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue, trade payables and accrued restructuring. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and commissions related to fiscal 2008. Decreases in deferred revenue related primarily to deferred revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 associated with our free of charge upgrades for CS4 and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom products, as well as declines in maintenance and support orders. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments related to the 2008 restructuring program that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, offset in part by new charges related to our 2009 restructuring program and acquisition of Omniture. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008, was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, deferred revenue, accrued restructuring and trade payables. Increases in deferred revenue related to maintenance and support and free of charge upgrade plan purchases which offset in part, decreases in deferred revenue related to royalties. Accrued restructuring costs increased due to the restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 offset in part by payments of facility costs during fiscal 2008 associated with the Macromedia acquisition. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in income taxes payable and accrued expenses. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of high sales of our CS4 family of products at the end of fiscal 2008. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments made as the result of the completion of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and profit sharing offset in part by increases in royalty accruals and charitable contributions. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2007, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS The primary working capital sources of cash for fiscal 2007 were increases in net income, accrued expenses, income taxes payable, deferred revenue and trade payables coupled with decreases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net changes in accrued expenses was primarily attributable to increases in accrued bonuses and accrued localization costs related to the localization of our CS3 family of products during fiscal 2007. Income taxes payable increased due to overall increased taxable income. Increases to deferred revenue related primarily to deferred maintenance and service revenue due to strong upgrade plan sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for our CS3 family of products and related individual creative products. The decrease in trade receivables was due to collections in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to high Acrobat 8 sales at the end of fiscal 2006 and strong collections during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 resulting from shipments of our CS3 family of products. The primary working capital use of cash in fiscal 2007 was a decrease in accrued restructuring costs which was primarily due to payments for facility and severance costs for fiscal 2007. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion for fiscal 2009, was primarily due to the acquisition of Omniture, purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Purchases of long-term investments and other assets during fiscal 2009 were less than fiscal 2008 primarily due to $56.0 million paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements which did not recur in fiscal 2009. Net cash from investing activities changed from cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $81.5 million to cash used in fiscal 2008 of $304.7 million primarily due to purchases of short-term investments offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2008 represented purchases of property and equipment, long-term investments and other assets and one business combination offset in part by proceeds from the sale of other investments in equity securities. The uses associated with the purchase of long-term investments and other assets related primarily to cash paid for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $56.0 million in fiscal 2008. The primary sources of cash from investment activities during fiscal 2007 were sales and maturities of short-term investments offset in part by purchases of short-term investments. The proceeds from the sales of short-term investments were primarily used for stock repurchases. Uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets which related primarily to the technology licensing arrangements that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the completion of two business combinations and one asset acquisition in fiscal 2007, and the purchase of a portion of the lease receivable totaling $80.4 million associated with our lease extension for the Almaden tower lease. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this lease extension. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash from financing activities changed from cash used in fiscal 2008 of $1.0 billion to cash provided for fiscal 2009 of $477.7 million, primarily due to additional borrowing under our credit agreement of $650.0 million and lower purchases of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock (See sections entitled “Stock Repurchase Program I” and “Stock Repurchase Program II” discussed below). Net cash used for financing activities decreased $328.8 million for a total of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to net borrowings under our credit agreement of $350.0 million. Additionally, we had lower purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year (See sections entitled “Stock Repurchase Program I” and “Stock Repurchase Program II” discussed below), offset in part by lower proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock. We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. The Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS Acquisition of Omniture On October 23, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Omniture, an industry leader in Web analytics and online business optimization based in Orem, Utah for approximately $1.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, we completed our tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Omniture common stock at a price of $21.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest. We expect to incur significant incremental costs, such as direct costs related to the acquisition and costs associated with restructuring our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash outlays. Restructuring On November 10, 2009, we initiated a restructuring plan to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan impacting up to approximately 630 full-time positions worldwide. In connection with this restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $25.5 million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 340 of these full-time positions worldwide. As of November 27, 2009, approximately $2.5 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these ongoing termination benefits is expected to be paid during fiscal 2010. The restructuring activities related to this program are only to those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect to record approximately $15 million to $18 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and up to approximately $26 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of the remaining full-time positions worldwide. We expect to accrue the facility related liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and pay these liabilities through fiscal 2021 based on current lease terms. Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures. We completed our acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a plan to restructure the pre-merger operations of Omniture to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with this restructuring plan, we accrued a total of approximately $10.6 million in costs related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 100 regular positions and for the closure of duplicative facilities. We also accrued approximately $0.2 million in costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind-down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by Omniture. These costs were recorded as a part of the purchase price allocation, as discussed in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and have been accrued for as of November 27, 2009. We expect to pay the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Additionally, approximately $1.5 million of restructuring costs related to facilities were included in the liabilities assumed by us upon acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program, consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately 560 full-time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities, in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of the 560 full-time positions globally. During fiscal 2009, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program. We vacated approximately 89,000 square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada. We accrued $8.5 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 6% as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $4.4 million. We also recorded charges of $6.7 million for ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining 100 full-time positions expected to be terminated. We have paid substantially all of the accrued termination benefits during fiscal 2009 with and expect to pay the remaining amounts in fiscal 2010. We expect to pay facilities-related liabilities through fiscal 2013. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring changes described above. 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may further decline during fiscal 2010 in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to the acquisition. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. At November 27, 2009, our existing credit facility is $1.0 billion and we have borrowed against the entire amount. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our credit agreement. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 50% of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Within the U.S., the portfolio is invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third-parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $350.0 million, $525.0 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares at an average price per share of $27.89 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 22.4 million shares at an average price of $36.26 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $40.04 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average price of $36.41 in open market transactions. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2009, November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007 were excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2009 and November 28, 2008, approximately $59.9 million and $134.7 million, respectively, of up-front payments remained under the agreements. See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 27, 2009. Stock Repurchase Program II Under this stock repurchase program, we had authorization to repurchase an aggregate of 50.0 million shares of our common stock. From the inception of the 50.0 million share authorization under this program, we provided prepayments of $1.9 billion under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the remaining authorized number of shares were repurchased. 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS During fiscal 2008, we provided prepayments of $1.0 billion and repurchased 31.9 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $37.15. During fiscal 2007, we provided prepayments of $850.0 million under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 17.7 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $40.50 and approximately $133.7 million of up-front payments remained under these agreements as of November 30, 2007. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 0.5 million shares at an average price of $39.79 in open market transactions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 27, 2009, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 27, 2009 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Operating leases $ 249.3 $ 53.2 $ 74.7 $ 44.8 $ 76.6 Purchase obligations 210.5 165.5 26.0 6.0 13.0 Debt 1,000.0 — — 1,000.0 — Total $ 1,459.8 $ 218.7 $ 100.7 $ 1,050.8 $ 89.6 As of November 27, 2009, the principal outstanding under the credit agreement was $1.0 billion which is due in full no later than February 16, 2013. Interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio. Our leases for the East and West Towers and the Almaden Tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of November 27, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2009 was $218.0 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that before the end of fiscal 2010, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits equal to $0 to approximately $10.0 million. These amounts would decrease income tax expense under accounting for income taxes and as a result of the revised accounting guidance for business combinations in fiscal 2010. See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the revised accounting guidance for business combinations, adjustments to acquired income tax liabilities (including adjustments for acquisitions completed prior to the effective date) that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized in income from continuing operations, with certain exceptions, if such changes occur after the measurement period. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. The fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to our Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the leases. As of November 27, 2009, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $1.3 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third-parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments In countries outside the U.S., we transact business, in U.S. dollars and in various other currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in Euro and Yen, respectively, are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts for Euro- or Yen-denominated revenue. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, our revenue exposures were 504.3 million Euros, 628.2 million Euros and 595.5 million Euros, respectively. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, our revenue exposures were 30.3 billion Yen, 36.8 billion Yen and 35.5 billion Yen, respectively. Our European operating expenses are primarily in Euro and our Japanese operating expenses are in Yen, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to Euro and Yen denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and forward contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of November 27, 2009, total outstanding contracts were $510.4 million which included the notional equivalent of $283.9 million in Euro, 182.1 million in Yen and $44.4 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of November 27, 2009, all contracts were set to expire at various times through July 2010. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition, we also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 27, 2009 and November 28, 2008, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $228.8 million and $149.1 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and the Japanese Yen. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 27, 2009, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with 72 TABLE OF CONTENTS changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 27, 2009, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 27, 2009. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $22.2 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $12.9 million. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program. See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Interest Rate Risk Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities At November 27, 2009, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $900.0 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions): Due within one year $ 387.6 Due within two years 249.9 Due within three years 218.6 Due after three years 43.9 Total $ 900.0 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 27, 2009. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 27, 2009 and November 28, 2008 (dollars in millions): -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/27/2009 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 910.8 909.2 905.4 900.0 893.9 888.0 882.2 -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/28/2008 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 1,145.8 1,142.3 1,136.4 1,129.7 1,123.0 1,116.4 1,109.9 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS Other Market Risk Privately Held Long-Term Investments The privately held companies in which we invest, can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. See Note 4 and Note 8 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our limited partnership interest in Adobe Ventures. Short-Term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 27, 2009, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $5.0 million compared to $3.0 million at November 28, 2008. The increase was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our equity holdings during fiscal 2009. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of November 27, 2009, that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business, Web and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, knowledge workers, developers, marketers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs. We also market and license our software directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users and through our own Website at www.adobe.com. In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and provide some of our solutions via SaaS, also known as hosted or “cloud-based” offerings. Our software runs on PCs and server-based computers, as well as various non-PC and mobile devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. ACQUISITIONS On October 28, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Day, a provider of WCM, digital asset management and social collaboration solutions based in Basel, Switzerland and Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $248.3 million. Day’s Web solutions combined with our existing enterprise portfolio will enable customers to better integrate their global Web presence and business applications in support of acquiring, servicing and retaining customers. We have included the financial results of Day in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the acquisition date however the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. Following the closing, we integrated Day as a product line within our Enterprise segment for financial reporting purposes. On October 23, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Omniture, an industry leader in Web analytics and online business optimization based in Orem, Utah, for approximately $1.8 billion. Accordingly, we have included the results of the business operations acquired from Omniture in our consolidated results of operations beginning on October 24, 2009. Coinciding with the integration of Omniture, we created a new reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Revenue Recognition Our revenue is derived from the licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, custom software development and consulting services and training. To a lesser extent our revenue includes non-software related hosting services, custom hosting development and consulting services, and technical support and training for hosting services. We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosting services, and consulting. For our software and software related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each element using VSOE, and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to: · provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the consideration should be allocated; · require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using BESP of deliverables if a vendor does not have VSOE of selling price or TPE of selling price; and · eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our fiscal quarter of 2010 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after November 27, 2009. Our revenue from sales containing non-software related hosting services, custom hosting development and consulting services, and related technical support and training are those impacted. For multiple element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of fair value, TPE or BESP, as applicable, and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method. This guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions. For multiple-element arrangements that contain software and non-software elements such as our hosted offerings, we allocate revenue to software or software related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use its BESP for that deliverable. Once revenue is allocated to software or software related elements as a group, it follows historic software accounting guidance. Revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element. Consistent with our methodology under previous accounting guidance, we determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third-parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS In certain instances, we are not able to establish VSOE for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements. This may be due to infrequently selling each element separately, not pricing products or services within a narrow range, or only having a limited sales history. When VSOE cannot be established, we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our offerings contain significant differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, we typically are not able to obtain TPE of selling price. When we are unable to establish selling prices using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. The most common fact pattern that emerged through analyzing these factors supports a BESP closely tied to Adobe’s list prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management, taking into consideration our go-to-market strategy. We regularly review VSOE and have established a review process for TPE and BESP and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. There was no material impact to revenue during the year ended December 3, 2010 resulting from changes in VSOE, TPE or BESP, nor do we expect a material impact from such changes in the near term. We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, and training. We have established BESP for all other offerings, including software products, non-software related hosting services, custom hosting development and consulting services, and technical support and training for hosting services. Given the nature of our transactions, which are primarily software and software-related, our go-to-market strategies and our pricing practices, total net revenue as reported during the year ended December 3, 2010 is materially consistent with total net revenue that would have been reported if the transactions entered into or materially modified after November 27, 2009 were subject to previous accounting guidance. Additionally, the new accounting standards for revenue recognition, if applied in the same manner to the year ended November 27, 2009, would not have had a material impact on total net revenues for that fiscal year. We do expect that this new accounting guidance will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the accounting. This may lead us to engage in new go-to-market practices in the future. In particular, we expect that the new accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products and services without VSOE into existing offerings and solutions. As these go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. As a result, our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from the results in the current period. Changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract. We are currently unable to determine the impact that the newly adopted accounting principles could have on our revenue as these go-to-market strategies evolve. In addition to multiple element arrangements, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. We recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. For our on-going traditional employee equity awards, we currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. Business Combinations We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: · future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; · expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; · the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and · discount rates. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issues, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and determined there was no impairment. We currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS fiscal 2008 and 2009 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In December 2010, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance related to the calculation of the carrying amount of a reporting unit when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test. More specifically, this update will require an entity to use an equity premise when performing the first step of a goodwill impairment test and if a reporting unit has a zero or negative carrying amount, the entity must assess and consider qualitative factors and whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The new accounting guidance is effective for public entities, for impairment tests performed during entities’ fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) that begin after December 15, 2010. Early application is not permitted. We will adopt the new disclosures in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, however as we currently do not have any reporting units with a zero or negative carrying amount, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2010, the FASB issued updated accounting guidance to clarify that pro forma disclosures should be presented as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period for purposes of preparing both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information. These disclosures should be accompanied by a narrative description about the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments. The new accounting guidance is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after December 15, 2010, and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the new disclosures in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2010 Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, to better align our marketing efforts and go-to-market strategies, we moved management responsibility for the Connect Solutions product line from our Knowledge Worker segment to our Enterprise segment. Prior year information has been updated to reflect this change. For fiscal 2010, we reported record revenue with strong financial results including exceeding $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in company history. Our performance was driven by continued adoption of CS5, which is our flagship product family that began shipping in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Our fiscal 2010 performance also benefitted from strength in other key business segments including our Knowledge Worker, Omniture, Enterprise and Print and Publishing segments. Fiscal 2010 financial results also benefitted from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2010 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2009 which was a 52-week year. In our Creative Solutions segment, broad adoption of CS5 continued to drive the overall performance of our creative business and contributed to strong revenue growth in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009. Since its release, CS5 revenue has grown approximately 21% when compared to a comparable period of time for CS4 products. The successful launch of Adobe Lightroom version 3 also contributed to our success in our creative business. 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS Our Knowledge Worker segment achieved 17% growth in fiscal 2010 when compared to fiscal 2009 due to continued solid demand for our Acrobat product family. We attribute this performance to strength in enterprise licensing of Acrobat across all geographies as well as the improved economic conditions in certain markets and geographies where we focus on Acrobat adoption. We achieved strong growth in fiscal 2010 with our Enterprise segment, which grew 18% when compared to fiscal 2009. We believe our increased investment in this business over the past several years is beginning to result in improved financial performance in the segment. Further, we believe the CEM value proposition of our enterprise products is resonating with industry analysts and customers, including Adobe Connect for efficient Web-conferencing, and Adobe LiveCycle which makes it easier for people to interact with information from enterprise systems through intuitive user experiences, improve efficiencies through business process automation, and enhance customer service through personalized communications management. In our Omniture business, we maintained strong momentum in fiscal 2010. Driving this success was increased awareness of our Online Marketing Suite value proposition in the marketplace as well as strong bookings performance. The number of Omniture user transactions in fiscal 2010 was 5.07 trillion, an increase of 12% when compared to fiscal 2009. Our Platform business declined slightly in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower revenue from OEM relationships. Our Print and Publishing business segment grew in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a non-recurring revenue deal as well as the launch of new products, including Adobe eLearning Suite version 2 and Adobe Captivate version 5.

Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our hosted service offerings including our hosted online business optimization services. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning on the commencement of the service. Of the $386.8 million and $74.6 million in subscription revenue for the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, approximately $309.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively, is from our Omniture segment with the remaining amounts representing our other business offerings. Our services and support revenue is comprised of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products and the sale of our hosted online business optimization services. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Segments In fiscal 2010, we categorized our products into the following segments: Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Omniture, Platform, and Print and Publishing products. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, to better align our marketing efforts and go-to-market strategies, we moved management responsibility for the Adobe Connect product line from our Knowledge Worker segment to our Enterprise segment. · Creative Solutions—Our Creative Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of creative and developer tasks to an extended set of customers. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS · Knowledge Worker—Our Knowledge Worker segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them share information and collaborate. This segment contains our Adobe Acrobat family of products. · Enterprise—Our Enterprise segment provides server-based CEM solutions to enterprise and government customers to optimize their information intensive customer-facing processes and improve the overall customer experience of their constituents. This segment contains our Adobe LiveCycle and Adobe Connect product lines. · Omniture—Our Omniture segment provides Web analytics and online business optimization products and services to manage and enhance online, offline and multi-channel business initiatives. · Platform—Our Platform segment includes client and developer technologies, such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Flash Lite, Adobe AIR, Adobe Flex, Adobe Flash Builder, ColdFusion, and also encompasses products and technologies created and managed in other Adobe segments. · Print and Publishing—Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses.

Fiscal 2010 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenue Revenue from Creative Solutions increased $354.4 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to strong licensing of CS4 during fiscal 2010 until the release of CS5, as well as strong adoption of CS5 beginning in the second quarter of the fiscal year. The increase was driven largely by a 23% increase in both Creative Suites and Photoshop point product revenue as compared to the prior year. The overall number of units licensed increased 23% when compared to fiscal 2009. Unit average selling prices, excluding large enterprise license agreement (“ELA”) deals, remained relatively stable during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenue from Knowledge Worker increased $96.8 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We attribute this success to strength in enterprise licensing of Acrobat and improved economic conditions in certain markets and geographies where we focus on Acrobat adoption. A 19% increase in the number of units licensed also contributed to the increase in revenue. Unit average selling prices, excluding large ELA deals, have remained relatively stable. Revenue from Enterprise increased $54.1 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to increased adoption of our LiveCycle and Connect products as well as the acquisition of Day, which closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and contributed $5.4 million in revenue. Revenue from Omniture increased $334.3 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We acquired Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and therefore do not have a full fiscal year of revenue for 2009 in which to provide a comparison between fiscal years. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenue from Platform decreased $2.1 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to lower developer tool revenue based on the inclusion of developer tools within some CS5 suites, offset in part by an increase in distribution revenue from OEM relationships with companies such as Google, where we offer their technologies as part of the download of Flash Player, Shockwave Player and Reader and generate revenue through successful installations of these technologies. Revenue from Print and Publishing increased $16.6 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to an improved economic environment in certain markets and geographies, the launch of new products, fees received for engineering services and royalties related to PostScript products. Fiscal 2009 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue Revenue from Creative Solutions decreased $370.7 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to reduced adoption of our CS family of products because of the global recession and generally weak macro-economic environment in fiscal 2009. The decrease was driven largely by a 15% decline in Creative Suites related revenue and a decline of 27% in Photoshop point product revenue. Also contributing to the decrease was an overall decline in the number of units licensed. Average unit selling prices remained relatively consistent. Revenue in Knowledge Worker decreased $200.1 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 for similar reasons as Creative Solutions in addition to a decrease in the licensing of our Acrobat family of products. We attribute the decline in revenue to lower volume licensing by our enterprise customers, as well as a decrease in the number of units sold through our shrink-wrap distribution channel. Average unit selling prices remained relatively consistent. Revenue from Enterprise decreased $5.3 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the economic slowdown in fiscal 2009 which resulted in reduced spending by our enterprise customers. We acquired Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and as such, there is no prior fiscal 2008 period with which to compare Omniture fiscal 2009 revenue. Revenue from Platform decreased $50.6 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the impact of the OSP which we announced on May 1, 2008, and involves the removal of certain licensing fees of our Flash Lite client with OEMs. Revenue in Print and Publishing decreased $33.6 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to reduced demand because of the global macro-economic downturn in fiscal 2009.

Increased revenue in our Knowledge Worker and Enterprise business segments also contributed to the increase as well as an improved economy across all geographies. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. The U.S. dollar strengthened against both the Euro and British pound causing revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars to decrease by approximately $18.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenue in Japan measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $23.7 million due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal 2009. The Australian dollar also strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in a favorable impact to revenue of approximately $12.1 million during fiscal 2010. We had no comparable impact to revenue from the Australian dollar during fiscal 2009. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue. During 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS fiscal 2010, our currency hedging program related to EMEA and Japan resulted in hedging gains of $19.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Fiscal 2009 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2009 decreased compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the global economic recession, which resulted in reduced adoption of many of our major products. Included in the overall decrease in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars decreased approximately $47.1 million, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, as compared to fiscal 2008. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue. Revenue in Asia measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $32.8 million due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, our currency hedging program related to the Euro and Yen resulted in hedging gains of $25.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk regarding foreign currency risks. Product Backlog The amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. Our shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was approximately 5% of fourth quarter fiscal 2010 revenue. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Our shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 9% of fourth quarter fiscal 2009 revenue.

Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue decreased due to the following: % Change 2010-2009 % Change 2009-2008 Amortization of purchased intangibles (23 )% (12 )% Amortization of acquired rights to use technology 1 (8 ) Localization costs related to our product launches (7 ) (1 ) Royalty cost (5 ) (1 ) Cost of sales 4 (2 ) Various individually insignificant items 1 (2 ) Total change (29 )% (26 )% Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, due to decreases in amortization of $46.4 million and $80.0 million, respectively, associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition which were fully amortized during fiscal 2009. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS The decrease in amortization of acquired rights to use technology during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily related to a charge for historical use of licensing rights associated with certain technology licensing arrangements entered into in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008 we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million was related to future licensing rights that were capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. The decrease in localization costs during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to CS4 products becoming fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2009, offset in part by the launch of CS5 products during fiscal 2010. The decrease in royalty costs during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily related to obligations to certain key vendors that were incurred during fiscal 2009 and did not recur during fiscal 2010. Cost of sales increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the associated increase in shrink-wrap shipments as a result of the launch of our CS5 products during fiscal 2010. Subscription Cost of subscription revenue consists of expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third-parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third-parties for rack space, power and similar items. Cost of subscription revenue increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of our acquisition of Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the addition of its related data center costs. Also included in cost of subscription revenue for fiscal 2010 is $58.4 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with this acquisition. Cost of subscription revenue increased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of our acquisition of Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the addition of its related data center costs. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount as a result of our acquisition of Omniture. Cost of services and support revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, due to decreases in compensation and related benefits driven by headcount reductions as well as increased consulting support provided by third- party systems integrators resulting in the downsizing of our consulting organization.

The decrease in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by decreases in compensation expense and a decrease in the costs associated with acquired rights to use technology. The decrease in compensation costs during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses increased (decreased) due to the following: % Change 2010-2009 % Change 2009-2008 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 16 % (13 )% Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 2 1 Various individually insignificant items 2 (3 ) Total change 20 % (15 )% We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool and service offerings. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Given the strength of our business during the first half of fiscal 2010, we made additional investments in sales and marketing which is reflected in the table below under marketing spending related to product launches and marketing efforts. Sales and marketing expenses increased (decreased) due to the following: % Change 2010-2009 % Change 2009-2008 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 16 % (8 )% Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 3 2 Marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenue 3 (4 ) Various individually insignificant items 5 — Total change 27 % (10 )% General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance. 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS General and administrative expenses increased (decreased) due to the following: % Change 2010-2009 % Change 2009-2008 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 15 % (8 )% Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology — (5 ) Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 5 2 Charitable contributions — (3 ) Professional and consulting fees 4 1 Depreciation and amortization 3 1 Various individually insignificant items 1 1 Total change 28 % (11 )% The decrease in allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily relates to the historical use of licensing rights associated with certain technology licensing arrangements entered into in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology increased in fiscal 2008 primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Charitable contributions represent funding of the Adobe Foundation which is a private foundation created to leverage human, technological and financial resources to drive social change and improve the communities in which we live and work. The decrease in charitable contributions during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the timing of contributions to the Adobe Foundation. Professional and consulting fees increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to increase in information technology services to support our business. Restructuring Charges Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan On November 10, 2009, in order to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan, we initiated a restructuring plan consisting of reductions of up to approximately 630 full-time positions worldwide. In connection with this restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $25.5 million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 340 of these full-time positions worldwide. The restructuring activities related to this program affect only those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. During fiscal 2010, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this plan. We vacated approximately 50,000 square feet of sales and or research and development facilities in Australia, Canada, Denmark and the U.S. We accrued $7.0 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 7% as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $7.1 million. We also recorded charges of $18.4 million in termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining full-time positions expected to be terminated worldwide. We also recorded net adjustments of approximately $2.2 million to reflect net decreases in previously recorded estimates for termination benefits and facilities-related liabilities in addition to minor adjustments for fluctuations related to foreign currency translation. Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program, consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately 560 full-time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities, in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of the 560 full-time positions globally. 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS During fiscal 2009, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program. We vacated approximately 89,000 square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada. We accrued $8.5 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 6% as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $4.4 million. We also recorded additional charges of $6.7 million for termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining 100 full-time positions expected to be terminated. We also recorded minor adjustments for fluctuations related to foreign currency translation. Macromedia Restructuring Plan We completed our acquisition of Macromedia on December 3, 2005. In connection with this acquisition, we initiated plans to restructure both the pre-merger operations of Adobe and Macromedia to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with the worldwide restructuring plan, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for employee positions that were eliminated and for the closure of duplicative facilities. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of $2.9 million related to changes in estimates related to Macromedia facilities restructuring charges due to changes in sub-lease income estimates. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring charges. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Incomplete Technology As a result of our acquisition of Omniture in fiscal 2009, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to twelve years. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of Macromedia in fiscal 2006, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years. During fiscal 2009, we completed one business combination, in addition to Omniture. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we completed one business combination. We acquired purchased intangibles through these acquisitions which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense increased 1% during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, as a result of intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 offset by a decrease in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets purchased through our Macromedia acquisition which were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2009. Amortization expense increased 5% during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangibles assets purchased through the acquisition of Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2010-2009 % Change 2009-2008 Interest and other income (expense), net $ 13.1 $ 31.4 $ 43.8 (58 )% (28 )% Percentage of total revenue * 1 % 1 % Interest expense (56.9 ) (3.4 ) (10.0 ) * (66 )% Percentage of total revenue (2 )% * * Investment gains (losses), net (6.1 ) (17.0 ) 16.4 (64 )% (204 )% Percentage of total revenue * (1 )% * Total non-operating income (expense), net $ (49.9 ) $ 11.0 $ 50.2 (554 )% (78 )% _________________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Yen currencies, and gains and losses on fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a reduction in interest earned of $12.8 million resulting from lower average interest rates on our investments and $5.8 million lower realized gains on our investments. During fiscal 2010, we also recorded a $20.8 million gain associated with a forward 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS contract purchased to hedge our economic exposure related to our acquisition of Day, which was primarily offset by foreign exchange losses and increased cash flow hedging costs. Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average invested balances, realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and lower foreign exchange losses. Interest Expense In February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes” and, together with the 2015 Notes, the “Notes”). As of November 27, 2009, we had an outstanding credit facility of $1.0 billion, which we repaid on February 1, 2010 with a portion of the proceeds from our Notes. The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2010 is primarily due to interest associated with higher borrowings resulting from the issuance of the Notes as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate due to the Notes. Interest expense for fiscal 2009 and 2008, primarily represents interest associated with our credit facility. Interest due under the credit facility is paid upon expiration of the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) contract or at a minimum, quarterly. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates. Investment Gains (Losses), Net Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. Investment gains and (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Net (losses) gains related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ (11.3 ) $ (18.7 ) $ 15.9 Gains from sale of marketable equity securities 4.0 — 5.4 Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities — (0.3 ) (4.9 ) Net gains related to our trading securities 1.2 2.0 — Total investment gains (losses), net $ (6.1 ) $ (17.0 ) $ 16.4 During fiscal 2010, net losses on our investments improved primarily due to a decrease in net unrealized losses incurred on certain of our cost method investments during fiscal 2009 offset in part by an increase in net realized losses from our Adobe Ventures portfolio of companies in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, net losses on our investments increased as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase on net unrealized losses related to our Adobe Ventures and cost method investments. Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2010-2009 % Change 2009-2008 Provision $ 168.5 $ 315.0 $ 206.7 (47 )% 52 % Percentage of total revenue 4 % 11 % 6 % Effective tax rate 18 % 45 % 19 % Our effective tax rate decreased approximately 27 percentage points during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of a U.S. income tax examination covering fiscal years 2005 through 2007 and stronger international profits, partially offset by the expiration of the research and development credit on December 31, 2009. Our effective tax rate increased approximately 26 percentage points during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to a one-time charge related to our acquisition of Omniture. The charge represented the tax cost of inter-company transactions necessary to license certain Omniture assets to Adobe’s trading companies so that Omniture’s services can be offered to customers from Adobe companies. 71 TABLE OF CONTENTS In December 2010, the United States Congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit through December 31, 2011. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 3, 2010 was $156.9 million, exclusive of $15.4 million of interest and penalties. In October 2010, a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2005 through 2007 was completed. Our accrued tax and interest related to these years was $59 million and was previously reported in long-term income taxes. We paid $20 million in conjunction with the aforementioned resolution. A net income statement tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of $39 million resulted. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that before the end of fiscal 2011, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 749.9 $ 999.5 Short-term investments $ 1,718.1 $ 905.0 Working capital $ 2,148.0 $ 1,629.1 Stockholders’ equity $ 5,192.4 $ 4,890.6 A summary of our cash flows is as follows: (in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,113.0 $ 1,117.8 $ 1,280.7 Net cash used for investing activities (1,159.3 ) (1,497.1 ) (304.7 ) Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities (215.3 ) 477.6 (1,021.6 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 12.0 14.7 (14.4 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (249.6 ) $ 113.0 $ (60.0 ) Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses; general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent; and cost of product revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in ESPP. Another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is described below. Cash flows from operating activities For fiscal 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2010 annual incentive plan and interest on our Notes both of which will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we made our first semi-annual interest payment associated with our Notes totaling $31.1 million. Increases in deferred revenue related primarily to activity from our acquisition of Omniture, the related renewal of calendar-year based contracts in addition to increases in maintenance and support orders and royalty revenue deferrals related to changes in customer billing terms. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as decreases in taxes payable, accrued restructuring and trade payables. Trade receivables increased as a result of products shipped and billed during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of the launch of Acrobat X and slower receivable payments pertaining to Omniture services. Increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets 72 TABLE OF CONTENTS related primarily to higher valuations on our cash flow and balance sheet hedges due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments of approximately $200.0 million for tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings as well as a $20.0 million settlement of an IRS exam in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments made related to the fiscal 2009 restructuring plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to adjustments made to previously recorded estimates, offset in part by new charges. For fiscal 2009, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with decreases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets and increases in income taxes payable. Trade receivables decreased primarily from CS4 revenue that was shipped in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, in addition to lower overall gross revenue and improved collections. The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue, trade payables and accrued restructuring. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and commissions related to fiscal 2008. Decreases in deferred revenue related primarily to deferred revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 associated with our free of charge upgrades for CS4 and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom products, as well as declines in maintenance and support orders. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments related to the 2008 restructuring program that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, offset in part by new charges related to our 2009 restructuring program and acquisition of Omniture. For fiscal 2008, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, deferred revenue, accrued restructuring and trade payables. Increases in deferred revenue related to maintenance and support and free of charge upgrade plan purchases which offset in part, decreases in deferred revenue related to royalties. Accrued restructuring costs increased due to the restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 offset in part by payments of facility costs during fiscal 2008 associated with the Macromedia acquisition. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in income taxes payable and accrued expenses. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of high sales of our CS4 family of products at the end of fiscal 2008. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments made as the result of the completion of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and profit sharing offset in part by increases in royalty accruals and charitable contributions. Cash flows from investing activities For fiscal 2010, net cash used for investing activities of $1.2 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2010 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets and the acquisition of Day. These uses of cash were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of equipment under our sale lease-back transaction and the sale of long-term investments and other assets. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our sale lease-back transaction. For fiscal 2009, net cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion was primarily due to the acquisition of Omniture, purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Purchases of long-term investments and other assets during fiscal 2009 were less than fiscal 2008 primarily due to $56.0 million paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements which did not recur in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2008, net cash used for investing activities of $304.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2008 represented purchases of property and equipment, long-term investments and other assets and one business combination offset in part by proceeds from the sale of other investments in equity securities. The uses associated with the purchase of long-term investments and other assets related primarily to cash paid for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $56.0 million in fiscal 2008. 73 TABLE OF CONTENTS Cash flows from financing activities In February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. Our proceeds were approximately $1.5 billion and were net of an issuance discount of $6.6 million. The Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of approximately $10.7 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2010. The proceeds from this offering are available for general corporate purposes. As of December 3, 2010, the amount outstanding under the Notes was $1.5 billion, which is included in long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. On February 1, 2010, we used $1.0 billion of the proceeds from the Notes offering to pay the outstanding balance on our credit facility, and as of December 3, 2010, this facility has no outstanding balance. We are in compliance with all of our covenants under our credit facility and the entire $1.0 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. Net cash from financing activities changed from cash provided for in fiscal 2009 of $477.6 million to cash used in fiscal 2010 of $215.3 million, primarily due to payment of the outstanding balance on our credit facility and treasury stock repurchases offset in part by proceeds from our Notes and treasury stock issuances. See sections entitled “Stock Repurchase Program I” and “Stock Repurchase Program II” discussed below. Net cash from financing activities changed from cash used in fiscal 2008 of $1.0 billion to cash provided for in fiscal 2009 of $477.6 million, primarily due to additional borrowing under our credit agreement of $650.0 million and lower purchases of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock. See sections entitled “Stock Repurchase Program I” and “Stock Repurchase Program II” discussed below. We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Acquisition of Day On October 28, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Day, a provider of WCM solutions that leading global enterprises rely on for Web 2.0 content application and content infrastructure, based in Basel, Switzerland and Boston, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the agreement, we completed our public tender offer to acquire all of the publicly held registered shares of Day for 139 Swiss Francs per share in cash in a transaction valued at approximately $248.3 million on a fully diluted equity-value basis. In order to hedge the economic exposure related to this acquisition, we entered into a forward contract to purchase 254.7 million Swiss Francs for $242.5 million U.S. dollars that matured near the closing date of the acquisition. Upon maturity of the forward contract, we recorded a $20.8 million gain to interest and other income (expense), net. This forward contract is accounted for as a separate transaction apart from the acquisition. Following the closing, we integrated Day as a product line within our Enterprise segment for financial reporting purposes. Restructuring During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. Currently, we have the following four active restructuring plans, two of which were the result of large acquisitions: · Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan · Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan · Omniture Restructuring Plan · Macromedia Restructuring Plan During fiscal 2010, we have accrued total restructuring charges of approximately $16.4 million of which approximately $2.6 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations which are expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The remaining $13.8 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 of which over 70% will be paid through 2013. During fiscal 2010, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately $49.9 million which consisted of approximately $42.3 million related to termination benefits and contract terminations and approximately $7.6 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. 74 TABLE OF CONTENTS During fiscal 2009, we accrued total restructuring charges of approximately $44.7 million of which approximately $31.0 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations which were substantially paid during fiscal 2010. The remaining $13.7 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities that are expected to be paid through 2013. During fiscal 2009, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately $49.7 million which consisted of approximately $37.6 million related to termination benefits and contract terminations and approximately $12.1 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2011 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. As of December 3, 2010, the amount outstanding under the Notes was $1.5 billion. On February 1, 2010, we used $1.0 billion of the proceeds from this offering to pay the outstanding balance on our credit facility. The remainder of the proceeds from the Notes are available for general corporate purposes. There is no outstanding balance under our credit facility and the entire $1.0 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 79% of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, corporate bonds and foreign government securities. Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third-parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution was not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program was limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and was subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our stock repurchase program authorized in April 2007 from a non-expiring share-based authority to a time-constrained dollar-based authority. As part of this amendment, the Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $1.6 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2012. This amended program did not affect the $250.0 million structured stock repurchase agreement entered into during March 2010. As of December 3, 2010, no prepayments remain under that agreement. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $850.0 million, $350.0 million and $525.0 million, respectively. Of the $850.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2010, $250.0 million was under the stock repurchase program prior to the program amendment and the remaining $600.0 million was under the amended $1.6 billion time-constrained dollar-based authority. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 31.2 million shares at an average price of $29.19 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares at an average price per share of $27.89 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 22.4 million shares at an average price of $36.26 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2007. 75 TABLE OF CONTENTS During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average price of $36.41 in open market transactions. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 3, 2010, November 27, 2009 and November 28, 2008 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 3, 2010, no prepayments remained under the agreements. As of November 27, 2009, approximately $59.9 million of prepayments remained under the agreements. Subsequent to December 3, 2010, as part of our $1.6 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $125.0 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $125.0 million stock repurchase agreement, $875.0 million remains under our time-constrained dollar-based authority. See Note 14 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs. See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 3, 2010. Stock Repurchase Program II Under this stock repurchase program, we had authorization to repurchase an aggregate of 50.0 million shares of our common stock. From the inception of the 50.0 million share authorization under this program, we provided prepayments of $1.9 billion under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the remaining authorized number of shares were repurchased. During fiscal 2008, we provided prepayments of $1.0 billion and repurchased 31.9 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $37.15. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 0.5 million shares at an average price of $39.79 in open market transactions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 3, 2010 consist of obligations under operating leases, capital leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments. 76 TABLE OF CONTENTS Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 3, 2010 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Notes $ 1,993.9 $ 62.3 $ 124.5 $ 714.8 $ 1,092.3 Operating leases 273.8 61.7 85.6 45.5 81.0 Capital lease obligations 30.6 9.9 19.9 0.8 — Purchase obligations 214.5 175.1 16.0 8.3 15.1 Total $ 2,512.8 $ 309.0 $ 246.0 $ 769.4 $ 1,188.4 In February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. As of November 27, 2009, we had an outstanding credit facility of $1.0 billion which we repaid on February 1, 2010 using the proceeds from the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2010. In August 2010, we made our first semi-annual interest of $31.1 million. In June 2010, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling $32.2 million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of 43 months. This transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and recorded at fair value. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio. Our leases for the East and West Towers and the Almaden Tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of December 3, 2010, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 3, 2010 was $156.9 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that before the end of fiscal 2011, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. The fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to our Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the leases. As of December 3, 2010 and November 27, 2009, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to 77 TABLE OF CONTENTS these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. During fiscal 2010, our limited partnership interest in Adobe Ventures was dissolved and all remaining assets were distributed to the partners. As part of this limited partnership interest, we provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures was serving at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acted in good faith on behalf of the partnership. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Risk Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments In countries outside the U.S., we transact business in U.S. dollars and various other currencies. Transactions denominated in Euro, Yen and British Pounds subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts for Euro- , Yen-, or British Pound-denominated revenue. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our revenue exposures were 542.9 million Euro, 504.3 million Euro and 628.2 million Euro, respectively. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our revenue exposures were 35.6 billion Yen, 30.3 billion Yen and 36.8 billion Yen, respectively. We began hedging British Pound transactions in 2010. Revenue exposures were 123.9 million British Pounds for fiscal 2010. Our European operating expenses are primarily in Euro and our Japanese operating expenses are in Yen, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to Euro and Yen denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and forward contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of December 3, 2010, the total absolute value of outstanding contracts was $1,035.8 million which included the notional equivalent of $570.1 million in Euro, $222.6 million in Yen and $243.1 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of December 3, 2010, all contracts were set to expire at various times through June 2011. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition, we also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 3, 2010 and November 27, 2009, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $387.6 million and $228.8 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted 78 TABLE OF CONTENTS revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, Yen, and British Pound. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 3, 2010, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 3, 2010, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 3, 2010. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $56.2 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $39.5 million. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program. See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Interest Rate Risk Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities At December 3, 2010, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1,706.9 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions): Due within one year $ 625.4 Due within two years 523.2 Due within three years 446.3 Due after three years 112.0 Total $ 1,706.9 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 3, 2010. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. 79 TABLE OF CONTENTS The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 3, 2010 and November 27, 2009 (dollars in millions): -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/3/2010 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 1,730.2 1,726.4 1,718.9 1,706.9 1,694.7 1,682.6 1,670.6 -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/27/2009 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS 910.8 909.2 905.4 900.0 893.9 888.0 882.2 Other Market Risk Privately Held Long-Term Investments The privately held companies in which we invest, can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. See Note 4 and Note 8 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our limited partnership interest in Adobe Ventures. Short-Term Investments and Marketable Equity Securities We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of December 3, 2010, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $11.2 million compared to $5.0 million at November 27, 2009. The increase was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our equity holdings during fiscal 2010. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of December 3, 2010, that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another.

BUSINESS OVERVIEWFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of software and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We market and license our software directly to enterprise customers through our sales force, and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We also distribute our products through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators, independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. We offer some of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model (also known as a hosted model or “cloud-based” model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. Our software runs on personal computers (“PCs”) and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia. ACQUISITIONS On January 13, 2012, we completed the acquisition of privately held Efficient Frontier, a multi-channel ad buying and optimization company. Efficient Frontier will be integrated into our Digital Marketing reportable segment for financial reporting purposes beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. See Note 2 and Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.During fiscal 2011, we completed six business combinations and two asset acquisitions with aggregate purchase prices totaling approximately $328.3 million. We have included the financial results of the business combinations in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates however, the impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. On October 28, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Day, a provider of WEM, digital asset management and social collaboration solutions based in Basel, Switzerland and Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $248.3 million. We have included the financial results of Day in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the acquisition date however the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations in fiscal 2010. Following the closing, we integrated Day as a product line within our Enterprise segment for financial reporting purposes. On October 23, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Omniture, an industry leader in web analytics and online business optimization based in Orem, Utah, for approximately $1.8 billion. Accordingly, we have included the results of the business operations acquired from Omniture in our consolidated results of operations beginning on October 24, 2009. Coinciding with the integration of Omniture, we created a new reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical 52Table of Contentsexperience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, custom software development, non-software related hosting services, consulting services, training and technical support.We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosting services, and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (""VSOE""), and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training.In October 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to: 1)provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the consideration should be allocated; 2) require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using best estimated selling price (""BESP"") of deliverables if a vendor does not have VSOE of selling price or third-party evidence (""TPE"") of selling price; and 3) eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2010 on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after November 27, 2009. The application of these new accounting standards, if applied in the same manner to the year ended November 27, 2009, would not have had a material impact on total net revenues for that fiscal year.For multiple element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of fair value, TPE BESP, as applicable, and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain software and non-software elements such as our hosted offerings, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling 53Table of Contentsprice. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use its BESP for that deliverable. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, it follows historic software accounting guidance. Revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.When we are unable to establish selling prices using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings.We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. Given the nature of our transactions, which are primarily software and software-related, our go-to-market strategies and our pricing practices, total net revenue as reported during the year ended December 2, 2011 is materially consistent with total net revenue that would have been reported if the transactions entered into or materially modified after November 27, 2009 were subject to previous accounting guidance. In addition to multiple element arrangements, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods.In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.Stock-based CompensationStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.54Table of ContentsFor our ongoing traditional employee equity awards, we currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends.We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and•discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill ImpairmentWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may 55Table of Contentsexist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and determined there was no impairment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced changes to in our business strategy which resulted in a reduction of forecasted revenue for certain of our products. We performed an update to our goodwill impairment test for the Enterprise reporting unit and determined there was no impairment.. The results of our annual impairment test and our update in the fourth quarter for our Enterprise reporting unit indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our fiscal 2008 and 2009 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveThere have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our consolidated financial statements.56Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2011Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we modified our segments due to changes in how we operate our business. We split our prior Creative Solutions segment into two new segments: Creative and Interactive Solutions and Digital Media Solutions. Creative and Interactive Solutions contains our Creative Suite family of products including our professional page layout and web layout products, whereas Digital Media Solutions contains our imaging and video products for professionals and hobbyists. We also merged our former Platform segment into the new Creative and Interactive Solutions segment to better align our focus with market trends and our opportunities. As part of our business unit reorganization, we also moved several products to different businesses. See Note 19 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Prior year information below has been updated to reflect these changes.For fiscal 2011, we reported solid financial results and executed against our fiscal 2011 strategic growth initiatives: Content Authoring, Digital Marketing Optimization and Customer Experience Management. Our performance was driven by continued demand for our CS5 product family as well as strength in our other business segments including our Enterprise, Knowledge Worker, Omniture and Digital Media Solutions segments. For comparative purposes, financial results for the year ended December 3, 2010 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar. This extra week had a favorable impact on our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 by approximately $35 million and related impact to expenses of approximately $20 million. Fiscal 2010 was a 53-week year, whereas fiscal 2011 was a 52-week year and our first quarter of fiscal 2011 contained one less week. In our Creative and Interactive Solutions segment, adoption of our CS5 family of products continued to drive the overall performance of our creative business. The launch of CS5.5 in May 2011 helped to maintain the revenue run-rate achieved by CS5. Overall, this resulted in 9% revenue growth in fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 in this segment.Our Digital Media Solutions segment revenue increased 5% during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an overall increase in licensing of our video authoring and image editing products.Our Knowledge Worker segment achieved 13% revenue growth during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010, due to continued strong demand for our Acrobat X product which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Our Enterprise segment also achieved strong revenue growth of 26% during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to our acquisition of Day in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, which contributed strong financial performance in this segment. In our Omniture business, we continued to achieve strong momentum during fiscal 2011 with revenue growth of 20% when compared to fiscal 2010. Driving this success was increased demand for our Adobe Online Marketing Suite as well as maintaining strong bookings performance. Our Print and Publishing business segment revenue decreased 3% during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to lower Shockwave revenue and the timing of Coldfusion product releases.Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 % Change2011-2010 % Change2010-2009Product $3,424.5 $3,159.2 $2,684.8 8% 18%Percentage of total revenue 81% 83% 91% Subscription 450.7 386.8 74.6 17% *Percentage of total revenue 11% 10% 3% Services and support 341.1 254.0 186.5 34% 36%Percentage of total revenue 8% 7% 6% Total revenue $4,216.3 $3,800.0 $2,945.9 11% 29%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is greater than 100%.As described in Note 19 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the following segments: Creative and Interactive Solutions, Digital Media Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Omniture and Print and Publishing.57Table of ContentsOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our hosted service offerings including our hosted online business optimization services. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning on the commencement of the service. Of the $450.7 million, $386.8 million and $74.6 million in subscription revenue for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, approximately $387.4 million, $340.6 million and $44.4 million, respectively, is from our Omniture segment with the remaining amounts representing our other business offerings. We expect our subscription revenue will increase as a result of our investments in new SaaS and subscription models that will allow us to target new users.Our services and support revenue is comprised of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products and the sale of our hosted online business optimization services. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.Segments In fiscal 2011, we categorized our products into the following segments:•Creative and Interactive Solutions—Our Creative and Interactive Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of design and publishing and developer tasks to an extended set of customers.•Digital Media Solutions—Our Digital Media Solutions segment contains our professional imaging and video products and focuses on many of the same creative professional customers as our Creative and Interactive Solutions business. •Knowledge Worker—Our Knowledge Worker segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them share information and collaborate. This segment contains our Acrobat family of products and our on-demand, web-based, electronic signature solutions resulting from our acquisition of EchoSign.•Enterprise—Our Enterprise segment provides server-based Customer Experience Management Solutions to enterprise and government customers to optimize their information intensive customer-facing processes and improve the overall customer experience of their constituents. This segment contains our Adobe Connect, Day and LiveCycle lines of products.•Omniture—Our Omniture segment provides web analytics and online business optimization products and services to manage and enhance online, offline and multi-channel marketing initiatives.•Print and Publishing—Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses.Segment Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 % Change2011-2010 % Change2010-2009Creative and Interactive Solutions $1,713.2 $1,577.6 $1,331.6 9 % 18%Percentage of total revenue 41% 42% 45% Digital Media Solutions 625.8 593.5 494.6 5 % 20%Percentage of total revenue 15% 16% 17% Knowledge Worker 740.2 654.3 557.6 13 % 17%Percentage of total revenue 18% 17% 19% Enterprise 442.7 351.7 297.9 26 % 18%Percentage of total revenue 10% 9% 10% Omniture 476.1 396.7 56.5 20 % *Percentage of total revenue 11% 10% 2% Print and Publishing 218.3 226.2 207.7 (3)% 9%Percentage of total revenue 5% 6% 7% Total revenue $4,216.3 $3,800.0 $2,945.9 11 % 29%58Table of Contents_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is greater than 100%.Fiscal 2011 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenue Revenue from Creative and Interactive Solutions increased $135.6 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The year-over-year increase in revenue was driven by continued licensing of the CS5 product family. During fiscal 2011, revenue associated with our Creative Suite products increased 7% as compared to fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, the overall number of units licensed for Creative and Interactive Solutions increased and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable. Revenue from Digital Media Solutions increased $32.3 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The growth was primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with our video authoring products, and to a lesser extent, our digital imaging products. Contributing to the growth was a 27% increase in revenue associated with Adobe Creative Suite Production Premium. Photoshop point product revenue remained relatively stable in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Both the overall number of units licensed and unit average selling prices for Digital Media Solutions remained relatively stable during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue from Knowledge Worker increased $85.9 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. We attribute this success to strong adoption of our Acrobat X product, which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, unit average selling prices for Knowledge Worker increased and the number of units licensed remained relatively stable. Revenue from Enterprise increased $91.0 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to our addition of products from the acquisition of Day to our Enterprise offerings and strong customer adoption of Day's WEM solutions.Revenue from Omniture increased $79.4 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was due to continued demand for our Online Marketing Suite.Revenue from Print and Publishing decreased $7.9 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower Shockwave revenue and the release of Coldfusion 9 at the end of fiscal 2009 for which a comparable release did not occur in the current year. Also contributing to the decline was a one-time large deal in Adobe Captivate and our Tech Communications products during fiscal 2010 that did not recur in fiscal 2011.Fiscal 2010 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenue (Prior year information below has been updated to reflect our fiscal 2011 segment changes)Revenue from Creative Solutions increased $246.0 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to strong licensing of CS4 during fiscal 2010 until the release of CS5, as well as strong adoption of CS5 beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The increase was driven largely by a 23% increase in Creative Suite products related revenue as compared to the prior year. Excluding large enterprise license agreement (“ELA”) deals, the overall number of units licensed increased and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenue from Digital Media Solutions increased $98.9 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with our image editing products and to a lesser extent our video authoring products. Contributing to the increase in revenue was growth of 24% in our Photoshop point product revenue coupled with a 27% increase in Creative Suite Production Premium revenue. Excluding ELA deals, the overall number of units licensed increased and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenue from Knowledge Worker increased $96.7 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We attribute this success to strength in enterprise licensing of Acrobat and improved economic conditions in certain markets and geographies where we focus on Acrobat adoption. An increase in the number of units licensed also contributed to the increase in revenue. Unit average selling prices, excluding large ELA deals, have remained relatively stable.Revenue from Enterprise increased $53.8 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to increased adoption of our LiveCycle and Adobe Connect products as well as the acquisition of Day, which closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and contributed $5.4 million in revenue.Revenue from Omniture increased $340.2 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. We acquired Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and therefore do not have a full fiscal year of revenue for 2009 in which to provide a comparison between fiscal years.59Table of ContentsRevenue from Print and Publishing increased $18.5 million during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to an improved economic environment in certain markets and geographies, the launch of new products, fees received for engineering services and royalties related to PostScript products.Geographical Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 % Change2011-2010 % Change2010-2009Americas $2,044.6 $1,835.3 $1,382.6 11% 33%Percentage of total revenue 49% 48% 46% EMEA 1,317.4 1,191.9 928.9 11% 28%Percentage of total revenue 31% 32% 32% Asia 854.3 772.8 634.4 11% 22%Percentage of total revenue 20% 20% 22% Total revenue $4,216.3 $3,800.0 $2,945.9 11% 29%Fiscal 2011 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenue by GeographyOverall revenue for fiscal 2011 increased in each of the geographic regions when compared to fiscal 2010. Within each geographic region, every reportable segment contributed to the increase in revenue with the exception of Print and Publishing, which experienced decreases in EMEA and Asia. The increase in revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 in the Americas, EMEA and Asia was attributable to the factors noted above.Fiscal 2010 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenue by GeographyOverall revenue in each of the geographic regions for fiscal 2010 increased compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the launch of CS5 in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as well as additional revenue from Omniture which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Increased revenue in our Knowledge Worker and Enterprise business segments also contributed to the increase as well as an improved economy across all geographies.Included in the overall increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

Revenue measured in both the Japanese Yen and other currencies also were favorably impacted as the U.S. Dollar weakened against these currencies. During fiscal 2011, our EMEA and Japanese Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains as noted above.60Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar strengthened against both the Euro and British pound causing revenue in EMEA measured in average U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenue in Japanese Yen was favorably impacted as the U.S. Dollar weakened against this currency as compared to fiscal 2009. Other currencies in Asia, specifically the Australian Dollar also strengthened against the U.S. Dollar resulting in a favorable impact to revenue during fiscal 2010. We had no comparable impact to revenue from the Australian Dollar during fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, our EMEA and Japanese Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains as noted above.See Note 19 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.Product BacklogThe actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. Our shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 was approximately 5% of fourth quarter fiscal 2010 revenue. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We expect that our shippable backlog will be insignificant in future periods.Cost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 % Change2011-2010 % Change2010-2009Product $125.7 $127.5 $180.6 (1)% (29)%Percentage of total revenue 3% 3% 6% Subscription 194.0 195.6 48.3 (1)% *Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 2% Services and support 118.2 80.4 67.8 47 % 19 %Percentage of total revenue 3% 2% 2% Total cost of revenue $437.9 $403.5 $296.7 9 % 36 %_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is greater than 100%.

Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to a decrease in amortization of $80.0 million associated with certain intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition which were fully amortized during fiscal 2009.Royalty costs decreased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and decreased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to a decrease in obligations to certain key vendors.The decrease in localization costs during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to capitalized localization costs associated with CS4 products becoming fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2009, offset in part by new localization costs incurred as a result of the launch of CS5 products during fiscal 2010.61Table of ContentsCost of sales increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the associated increase in shrink-wrap shipments as a result of the launch of our CS5 products during fiscal 2010.SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third-parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third-parties for rack space, power and similar items. Cost of subscription revenue decreased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Omniture that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2011 offset in part by increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and increases in data center costs related to higher transaction volumes.Cost of subscription revenue increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of our acquisition of Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and the addition of its related data center costs. Also included in cost of subscription revenue for fiscal 2010 is $58.4 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with this acquisition. Services and SupportCost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount primarily from the Day acquisition.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount as a result of our acquisition of Omniture.

The increase in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by increases in compensation expense due to additional headcount as a result of our acquisition of Omniture and to higher employee compensation including bonuses based on company performance to date when compared to fiscal 2009. 62Table of ContentsResearch and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.Research and development expenses increased due to the following: % Change2011-2010 % Change2010-2009Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth6% 2%Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation— 16Various individually insignificant items2 2Total change8% 20%We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products.

Professional and consulting fees increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to increases in information technology services to support our business. 63Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Related Charges During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. In connection with our recent Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan initiated in November 2011, we accrued $81.9 million for termination benefits and closing redundant facilities as well as $12.7 million related to the write-off of certain assets that were no longer useful to the company based on changes in our business. In connection with our Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, we accrued $3.7 million during fiscal 2011 for closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2010, in connection with our Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan we accrued $25.4 million for termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2009, we accrued $25.5 million for termination benefits related to our Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan and we also accrued $15.2 million for termination benefits and closing redundant facilities related to our Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan. In connection with all of our restructuring plans, we recorded minor favorable adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the periods presented.See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Incomplete TechnologyDuring the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions including Macromedia in fiscal 2006, Omniture in fiscal 2009, Day in fiscal 2010 and eight smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2011. As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years. Amortization expense decreased 41% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Macromedia that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2010. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in amortization expense as a result of intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Day in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as well as an increase in intangible assets purchased through our fiscal 2011 acquisitions.Amortization expense increased 1% during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This increase was offset by a decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our Macromedia acquisition that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2009.

Interest and other income (expense), net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Yen currencies, and gains and losses on fixed income investments.Interest and other income (expense), net changed from net income in fiscal 2010 to net expense in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased foreign exchange losses of $17.3 million partially offset by increased interest income of $2.4 million due to higher average interest rates on our investments.Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a reduction in interest earned of $12.8 million resulting from lower average interest rates on our investments and $5.8 million lower realized gains on our investments. During fiscal 2010, we also recorded a $20.8 million gain associated with a forward contract purchased to hedge our economic exposure related to our acquisition of Day, which was offset in part by foreign exchange losses and increased cash flow hedging costs.64Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseIn February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes” and, together with the 2015 Notes, the “Notes”). On February 1, 2010, we repaid the outstanding balance under our $1.0 billion credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from our Notes. The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest associated with higher borrowings resulting from the issuance of the Notes. The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to interest associated with higher borrowings resulting from the issuance of the Notes as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate due to the Notes. Interest expense for fiscal 2009 primarily represents interest associated with the then outstanding balance under our credit facility. Interest due on any outstanding balance under the credit facility was paid upon expiration of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) contract or at a minimum, quarterly. Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. Investment gains and (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009Net gains (losses) related to our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies $5.3 (11.3) (18.7)Gains from sale of marketable equity securities 0.8 4.0 —Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of ourmarketable equity securities (0.2) — (0.3)Net gains related to our trading securities — 1.2 2.0Total investment gains (losses), net $5.9 (6.1) (17.0) During fiscal 2011, total investment gains (losses), net improved to net gains primarily due to unrealized losses related to our indirect investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2010 that did not recur during fiscal 2011. This was offset in part by a decrease in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities during fiscal 2011 due to less sales of these investments.During fiscal 2010, net losses on our investments improved primarily due to a decrease in net unrealized losses incurred on certain of our direct investments in privately held companies during fiscal 2009 offset in part by an increase in net realized losses from our portfolio of indirect investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2010.Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 % Change2011-2010 % Change2010-2009Provision $202.4 $168.5 $315.0 20% (47)%Percentage of total revenue 5% 4% 11% Effective tax rate 20% 18% 45% Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the one-time tax costs of licensing acquired company assets to Adobe's trading companies. These costs were partially offset by tax benefits related to a favorable state income tax ruling and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit.Our effective tax rate decreased approximately twenty-seven percentage points during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of a U.S. income tax examination covering fiscal years 2005 through 2007 and stronger international profits, partially offset by the expiration of the research and development credit on December 31, 2009. 65Table of ContentsWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2011 was $163.6 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2011 were recognized in the future, $145.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $17.9 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns.As of December 2, 2011, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $12.3 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)December 2, 2011 December 3, 2010Cash and cash equivalents$989.5 $749.9Short-term investments$1,922.2 $1,718.1Working capital$2,520.7 $2,148.0Stockholders’ equity$5,783.1 $5,192.4A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009Net cash provided by operating activities$1,543.3 $1,113.0 $1,117.8Net cash used for investing activities(757.4) (1,159.3) (1,497.1)Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities(550.4) (215.3) 477.6Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents4.1 12.0 14.7Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$239.6 $(249.6) $113.0 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of product revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the ESPP. Another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is described below. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2011, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued restructuring. Increases in deferred revenue related primarily to an overall increase in billing activity for maintenance and support/upgrade plans, hosted and professional services and site and term licenses. Accrued restructuring increased primarily due to recognition of liabilities related to employee termination and facility exit costs associated with the Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and the majority of which will be paid in the first quarter 66Table of Contentsof fiscal 2012. See Note 11 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges.The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2011 were increases in trade receivables coupled with decreases in accrued expenses and taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of overall higher sales levels and billing occurring during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, offset in part by an increased rate of collection for Omniture services. Decreases in accrued expenses were primarily related to lower accrued bonus levels in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2011, we also made our second and third semi-annual interest payments associated with our Notes totaling $62.3 million. Taxes payable decreased primarily due to the resolution of a Canadian Tax audit offset in part by quarterly increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. For fiscal 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2010 annual incentive plan and interest on our Notes both of which were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we made our first semi-annual interest payment associated with our Notes totaling $31.1 million. Increases in deferred revenue related primarily to activity from our acquisition of Omniture, the related renewal of calendar-year based contracts in addition to increases in maintenance and support orders and royalty revenue deferrals related to changes in customer billing terms. The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2010 were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as decreases in taxes payable, accrued restructuring and trade payables. Trade receivables increased as a result of products shipped and billed during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of the launch of Acrobat X and slower receivable payments pertaining to Omniture services. Increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets related primarily to higher valuations on our cash flow and balance sheet hedges due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments of approximately $200.0 million for tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings as well as a $20.0 million settlement of an IRS exam in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments made related to the fiscal 2009 restructuring plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to adjustments made to previously recorded estimates, offset in part by new charges. For fiscal 2009, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with decreases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets and increases in income taxes payable. Trade receivables decreased primarily from CS4 revenue that was shipped in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, in addition to lower overall gross revenue and improved collections. The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2009 were decreases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue, trade payables and accrued restructuring. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and commissions related to fiscal 2008. Decreases in deferred revenue related primarily to deferred revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 associated with our free of charge upgrades for CS4 and Photoshop Lightroom products, as well as declines in maintenance and support orders. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments related to the 2008 restructuring program that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, offset in part by new charges related to our 2009 restructuring program and acquisition of Omniture.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2011, net cash used for investing activities of $0.8 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and multiple business acquisitions, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2011 represented purchases of property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, intangibles and other assets. On January 13, 2012, we acquired privately held Efficient Frontier, a multi-channel ad buying and optimization company, for approximately $346 million in cash. See Note 2 and Note 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.For fiscal 2010, net cash used for investing activities of $1.2 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2010 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets and the acquisition of Day. These uses of cash were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of equipment under our sale lease-back transaction and the sale of long-term investments. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our sale lease-back transaction. 67Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2009, net cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion was primarily due to the acquisition of Omniture, purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2011, net cash used for financing activities of $550.4 million was primarily due to treasury stock repurchases offset in part by proceeds from our treasury stock issuances. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.In February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. On February 1, 2010, we paid the outstanding balance on our credit facility, and the entire $1.0 billion credit line under this facility remains available for borrowing.For fiscal 2009, net cash provided by financing activities of $477.6 million was primarily due to additional borrowing under our credit facility and proceeds from treasury stock issuances, offset in part by treasury stock repurchases. See section entitled Stock Repurchase Program discussed below. We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. RestructuringDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. Currently, we have the following five active restructuring plans, two of which were the result of large acquisitions:•Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan•Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan•Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan•Omniture Restructuring Plan•Macromedia Restructuring PlanAs of December 2, 2011, we have accrued total restructuring charges of approximately $88.4 million of which approximately $74.4 million relates to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations that are expected to be paid during fiscal 2012. The remaining $14.0 million relates to the cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021of which approximately 75% will be paid through 2014. During fiscal 2011, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately $13.1 million which consisted of approximately $6.8 million and $6.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.As of December 3, 2010, we accrued total restructuring charges of approximately $16.4 million of which approximately $2.6 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations which were paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The remaining $13.8 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities and were expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 of which over 70% will be paid through 2013. During fiscal 2010, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately $49.9 million which consisted of approximately $42.3 million related to termination benefits and contract terminations and approximately $7.6 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our restructuring plans.Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2012 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $2.9 billion as of December 2, 2011. Of this amount, approximately 75% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.68Table of ContentsCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. As of December 2, 2011, the amount outstanding under the Notes was $1.5 billion. There is no outstanding balance under our credit facility and the entire $1.0 billion credit line under this facility remains available for borrowing.We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 78% of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities, municipal securities, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities.Stock Repurchase ProgramDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our stock repurchase program authorized in April 2007 from a non-expiring share-based authority to a time-constrained dollar-based authority. As part of this amendment, the Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $1.6 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $695.0 million, $850.0 million and $350.0 million, respectively. Of the $850.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2010, $250.0 million was under the stock repurchase program prior to the program amendment and the remaining $600.0 million was under the amended $1.6 billion time-constrained dollar-based authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at an average price of $31.81 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 31.2 million shares at an average price of $29.19 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares at an average price per share of $27.89 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2011, December 3, 2010 and November 27, 2009 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2011 and December 3, 2010 no prepayments remained under the agreements. As of November 27, 2009, approximately $59.9 million of prepayments remained under the agreements. Subsequent to December 2, 2011, as part of our $1.6 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $80.0 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $80.0 million stock repurchase agreement, $225.0 million remains under our time-constrained dollar-based authority. See Note 14 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2011.69Table of ContentsSummary of Stock Repurchases for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands, except average amounts)Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2011 2010 2009 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageDecember 1997 From employees(1) 1 $33.57 1 $35.66 1 $24.00 Open market — $— — $— — $— Structured repurchases(2) — $— 9,358 $33.11 15,231 $27.89June 2010 Structured repurchases(2) 21,849 $31.81 21,807 $27.51 — $—Total shares 21,850 $31.81 31,166 $29.19 15,232 $27.89Total cost $695,015 $909,900 $424,851 _________________________________________ (1) The repurchases from employees represent shares cancelled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due.(2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions.

See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 2, 2011 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsNotes $1,931.7 $62.3 $124.5 $695.3 $1,049.6Operating leases 251.2 56.8 70.6 43.9 79.9Capital lease obligations 20.7 9.9 10.8 — —Purchase obligations 296.1 267.3 11.6 4.2 13.0Total $2,499.7 $396.3 $217.5 $743.4 $1,142.5NotesIn February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2010. During fiscal 2011 interest payments totaled $62.3 million. At December 2, 2011, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $431.7 million. Capital Lease ObligationIn June 2010, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling $32.2 million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of 43 months. This transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and recorded at fair value.CovenantsOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio. Our leases for the East and West Towers and the Almaden Tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of December 2, 2011, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan.Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.70Table of ContentsAccounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2011 was $163.6 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million. RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.GuaranteesThe lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. The fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to our Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the leases. As of December 2, 2011 and December 3, 2010, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees, for both leases, remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the U.S., we transact business in U.S. dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Additionally, we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts to hedge our Euro- , Yen-, or British Pound-denominated revenue.Our revenue exposures for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in millions, except Yen): Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009Euro€557.6 €542.9 €504.3Yen (in billions)¥34.7 ¥35.6 ¥30.3British Pounds£144.8 £123.9 £—71Table of ContentsOur European operating expenses are primarily in Euro and our Japanese operating expenses are primarily in Yen, which naturally mitigates a portion of the exposure related to our Euro and Yen denominated product revenue. We then hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and/or forward contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. In addition, we hedge our net monetary assets and liabilities using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. As of December 2, 2011, the total absolute value of outstanding contracts was $1,007.5 million which included the notional equivalent of $545.4 million in Euro, $203.3 million in Yen and $258.8 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of December 2, 2011, all contracts were set to expire at various times through June 2012. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty.In addition, we also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2011 and December 3, 2010, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $481.4 million and $387.6 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted TransactionsWe may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, Yen, and British Pound. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2011, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 2, 2011, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2011. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $64.7 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $44.9 million.We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis.72Table of ContentsWe regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt December 2, 2011, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1,909.9 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):Due within one year$646.7Due within two years620.8Due within three years429.6Due after three years212.8Total$1,909.9A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 2, 2011. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 2, 2011 and December 3, 2010 (dollars in millions):-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/2/2011 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS1,935.5 1,930.6 1,922.1 1,909.9 1,896.4 1,883.0 1,869.9-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/3/2010 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS1,730.2 1,726.4 1,718.9 1,706.9 1,694.7 1,682.6 1,670.6Other Market RiskPrivately Held Long-Term InvestmentsThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.Short-Term Investments and Marketable Equity SecuritiesWe are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of December 2, 2011, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $12.3 million compared to $11.2 million at December 3, 2010. The increase was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our equity holdings during fiscal 2011.The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of December 2, 2011, that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another.(in millions) 50% 35% 15%Marketable equity securities $6.2 $4.3 $1.873Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:12.392952

BUSINESS OVERVIEWFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of software and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We market and license our software directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We also distribute our products through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators, independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. We offer some of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model (also known as a hosted or “cloud-based” model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. Our software runs on personal computers (“PCs”) and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). ACQUISITIONS On January 13, 2012, we completed the acquisition of privately held Efficient Frontier, a multi-channel digital ad buying and optimization company. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we began integrating Efficient Frontier into our Digital Marketing segment, however, the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. During fiscal 2011, we completed six business combinations and two asset acquisitions with aggregate purchase prices totaling approximately $328.3 million. We have included the financial results of the business combinations in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates, however, the impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. On October 28, 2010, we completed the acquisition of Day, a provider of Web Experience Management (“WEM”), digital asset management and social collaboration solutions based in Basel, Switzerland and Boston, Massachusetts for approximately $248.3 million. We have included the financial results of Day in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the acquisition date, however, the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations in fiscal 2010. Following the closing, we integrated Day as a product line within our Digital Marketing segment for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.55Table of ContentsWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the licensing of perpetual and time-based software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosting services, consulting services, training and technical support.We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosting services, and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training.For multiple element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of fair value, third-party evidence (“TPE”) or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain software and non-software elements such as our hosted offerings, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use its BESP for that deliverable. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, it follows historic software accounting guidance. Revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.When we are unable to establish selling prices using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP.We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. 56Table of ContentsWe must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.Stock-based CompensationStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.In fiscal 2012, the Executive Compensation Committee of Adobe's Board of Directors eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees and stock option grants to non-employee directors were minimal. In lieu of stock options, we granted restricted stock units as the primary form of equity awards to employees. Stock option grants prior to fiscal 2012 continue to vest over the requisite service period and had a material impact to stock-based compensation cost for fiscal 2012 and are expected to have a material impact to stock-based compensation cost until the majority of stock options are fully vested. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) shares. This fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, the expected term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends.We use a 24-month expected term, which approximates our offering period. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense for ESPP shares in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures for both ESPP shares and existing stock option grants that continue 57Table of Contentsto vest, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and•discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill ImpairmentWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and determined there was no impairment. The results of our annual impairment test indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 58Table of Contentsliabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our fiscal 2008 and 2009 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThere have been no new accounting pronouncements made effective during the year ended November 30, 2012, that are of significance, or potential significance, to us.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveThere have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our consolidated financial statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2012Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we modified our segments due to changes in how we operate our business. We combined our Creative and Interactive Solutions segment with our Digital Media Solutions segment and our Knowledge Worker segment, and named it Digital Media. We also renamed our Omniture segment to Digital Marketing and combined it with our Enterprise segment. These changes reflect our focus on our two strategic growth opportunities. Our Print and Publishing segment, which contains many of our mature products and solutions, continues to be reported as it was in fiscal 2011 and 2010. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment and geographical information. Prior year information below has been updated to reflect these changes.For fiscal 2012, we reported solid financial results and executed against our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.In May 2012, we launched Adobe Creative Suite 6 (“CS6”) which is at the center of Adobe Creative Cloud, our new subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications that was also released in May 2012. The launch of CS6 included major updates to all of our core Creative Suite (“CS”) point products as well as four suite versions. Over time, 59Table of Contentswe expect Creative Cloud to transform our business model and drive higher revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release.We anticipate accelerated adoption of Creative Cloud in fiscal 2013, which we expect will cause our traditional perpetual license revenue and, in turn, total net revenues in fiscal 2013, to decline. During this transition we do not anticipate a corresponding decrease in expenses, which we believe will adversely affect our net income and operating margin in fiscal 2013. However, over time we expect this business model transition will significantly increase our long-term revenue growth rate by (1) attracting new users, (2) keeping our end user base current and (3) thereby driving higher average revenue per user. Additionally, our shift to a subscription model will increase the amount of our recurring revenue that is ratably reported, driven by broader Creative Cloud adoption over the next several years.We plan to continue to offer the perpetual licensing model as we transition our customers to this new subscription-based model.To assist with the understanding of this transition and the related shift in revenue described above, we have introduced the use of certain performance metrics which we will use to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. These metrics include the total number of paid, active subscribers and Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”). We define ARR as the sum of: •the number of paid, active subscribers, multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month, multiplied by twelve months; plus, •twelve months of contract value of Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”) where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract. In addition, we expect renewal rates associated with Creative Cloud, and potentially other subscription offerings, will become key metrics used to measure their performance. Because the majority of Creative Cloud subscriptions have been annual and the Creative Cloud launched in May 2012, we have not yet reached the first anniversary of these annual subscriptions and, therefore, we anticipate that meaningful data regarding subscription renewal rates will first become available later in fiscal year 2013.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2012•We continue to derive the majority of our revenue from perpetual licenses. However, our subscription revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, has increased to 15% in fiscal 2012 from approximately 11% and 10% in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively, as we transition more of our business to a subscription-based model.•Our total revenue of $4.4 billion increased $187.4 million and $603.7 million, or 4% and 11%, from $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the continued success of our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Suite family of products.•Cost of revenue and operating expenses of $3.2 billion increased by $106.5 million and $416.6 million, or 3% and 15%, from $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. These increases are primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount.•Income before income taxes of $1.1 billion increased by $83.6 million and $175.6 million, or 8% and 19%, from $1.0 billion and $943.2 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. •Net income of $832.8 million remained stable compared to fiscal 2011 and increased $58.1 million, or 7%, from $774.7 million in fiscal 2010.•Net cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion remained stable compared to fiscal 2011 and increased $386.6 million, or 35%, from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increases in net income and deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables from increased cash collections. 60Table of ContentsRevenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Product $3,342.8 $3,416.5 $3,159.2 (2)% 8%Percentage of total revenue 76% 81% 83% Subscription 673.2 458.6 386.8 47 % 19%Percentage of total revenue 15% 11% 10% Services and support 387.7 341.2 254.0 14 % 34%Percentage of total revenue 9% 8% 7% Total revenue $4,403.7 $4,216.3 $3,800.0 4 % 11%As described in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the following segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing.Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including our digital marketing services and Creative Cloud. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning on the commencement of the service. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new SaaS and subscription models. We also expect this to increase the amount of recurring revenue we generate as a percent of our total revenue. Of the $673.2 million, $458.6 million and $386.8 million in subscription revenue for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, approximately $553.2 million, $429.2 million and $375.3 million, respectively, is from our Digital Marketing segment, with the remaining amounts representing our Digital Media segment offerings. Our services and support revenue is comprised of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products and the sale of our hosted digital marketing services. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.Segments In fiscal 2012, we categorized our products into the following segments:•Digital Media—Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. •Digital Marketing—Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers.•Print and Publishing—Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses.Segment Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Digital Media $3,128.5 $3,088.6 $2,834.4 1 % 9 %Percentage of total revenue 71% 73% 75% Digital Marketing 1,058.4 909.4 739.4 16 % 23 %Percentage of total revenue 24% 22% 19% Print and Publishing 216.8 218.3 226.2 (1)% (3)%Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 6% Total revenue $4,403.7 $4,216.3 $3,800.0 4 % 11 %61Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenue Digital MediaRevenue from Digital Media remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, due to solid demand for our Acrobat family of products as well as the continued momentum of the CS6 launch in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, offset by better than expected growth associated with our subscription offerings.Revenue related to our creative professional products, which included our Creative Suite editions and CS point products as well as the recently released Creative Cloud, decreased slightly during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to higher than expected customer adoption of Creative Cloud and point product subscriptions. We anticipate accelerated adoption of Creative Cloud and point product subscriptions, for which revenue is recognized over time, and that this adoption will cause our traditional perpetual license revenue to decline. The decreases in revenue associated with our creative professional products were offset in part by growth associated with the May 2012 release of new Photoshop point products for which the previous release occurred in fiscal 2010.Revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increases associated with third-party toolbar distribution via Flash Player downloads as well as continued demand related to the May 2012 release of Adobe Lightroom 4. For our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed remained relatively stable while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Unit average selling prices, excluding subscriptions, decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.Document Services revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, also increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased Document Exchange Services revenue including revenue generated from our EchoSign eSignatures service and the launch of Adobe Acrobat XI in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Within Document Services, excluding large enterprise license agreement deals, the number of units licensed remained relatively stable while the unit average selling prices increased for our Acrobat offerings for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $149.0 million, or 16% during fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to continued growth of our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 35% year-over-year and includes our Adobe CQ WEM offerings and revenue generated from products associated with our recent acquisition of Efficient Frontier. Also contributing to the growth in revenue was our Adobe Connect hosted offering. As expected, increases in these areas were offset in part by a decrease in revenue associated with Adobe LiveCycle product offerings as we continue to shift our focus to our Adobe Marketing Cloud including our WEM solution.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue, offset by increases in fees received for consulting services and royalties related to PostScript products.Fiscal 2011 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenue Digital MediaRevenue from Digital Media increased $254.2 million, or 9%, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The year-over-year increase in revenue was driven by continued licensing of the CS5 product family.Revenue related to our creative professional products, which included our Creative Suite editions and CS point products, increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in suite revenue associated with our Master Collection, and to a lesser extent, our design and video authoring suites. Also contributing to the growth was an increase in revenue associated with our Illustrator and InDesign point products. Revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to increases associated with third-party toolbar distribution via Adobe Reader and Flash Player downloads as well as our Digital Publishing solution which was made available to all enterprise customers during fiscal 2011.62Table of ContentsFor our creative offerings, both the total number of units licensed and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.Document Services revenue increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. We attribute this success to strong adoption of our Acrobat X product, which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, unit average selling prices for Document Services increased and the number of units licensed remained relatively stable. Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $170.0 million, or 23%, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to continued customer adoption of our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which includes our WEM offerings resulting from the acquisition of Day, which closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing decreased $7.9 million, or 3%, during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower Shockwave revenue and the release of ColdFusion 9 at the end of fiscal 2009 for which a comparable release did not occur in the current year. Also contributing to the decline was a one-time large deal in Adobe Captivate and our Tech Communications products during fiscal 2010 that did not recur in fiscal 2011.Geographical Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Americas $2,196.4 $2,044.6 $1,835.3 7 % 11%Percentage of total revenue 50% 49% 48% EMEA 1,294.6 1,317.4 1,191.9 (2)% 11%Percentage of total revenue 29% 31% 32% APAC 912.7 854.3 772.8 7 % 11%Percentage of total revenue 21% 20% 20% Total revenue $4,403.7 $4,216.3 $3,800.0 4 % 11%Fiscal 2012 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenue by GeographyOverall revenue for fiscal 2012 increased in the Americas and APAC and declined slightly in EMEA when compared to fiscal 2011. Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2012 primarily due to revenue increases in Digital Media and Digital Marketing, offset slightly by a decline in Print and Publishing revenue. Despite the launch of CS6 in May 2012, the current economic conditions in Europe and the weakening of the Euro and British Pound against the U.S. Dollar caused revenue in EMEA to decline slightly during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. Revenue in APAC increased across all reportable segments during fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011. Within each geographical region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Fiscal 2011 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenue by GeographyOverall revenue for fiscal 2011 increased in each of the geographic regions when compared to fiscal 2010. Within each geographic region, every reportable segment contributed to the increase in revenue with the exception of Print and Publishing, which experienced decreases in EMEA and APAC. The increase in revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 in the Americas, EMEA and APAC was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.63Table of ContentsIncluded in the overall increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

This decrease was offset in part by the favorable impact to revenue measured in Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies as the U.S. Dollar weakened against these currencies. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2012 as noted in the table above. During fiscal 2011, the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA currencies were favorably impacted as the U.S. Dollar weakened against these currencies causing revenue in EMEA measured in average U.S. Dollar equivalents to increase compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue measured in both the Japanese Yen and other currencies also were favorably impacted as the U.S. Dollar weakened against these currencies. During fiscal 2011, our EMEA and Japanese Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains as noted above.See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.Product BacklogThe actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.Cost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Product $121.7 $125.7 $127.5 (3)% (1)%Percentage of total revenue 3% 3% 3% Subscription 219.1 194.0 195.6 13 % (1)%Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 5% Services and support 143.0 118.2 80.4 21 % 47 %Percentage of total revenue 3% 3% 2% Total cost of revenue $483.8 $437.9 $403.5 10 % 9 %64Table of ContentsProductCost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.Cost of product revenue decreased due to the following: % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Cost of sales(6)% — %Excess and obsolete inventory2 —Amortization of purchased intangibles(1) 6Royalty cost— (3)Various individually insignificant items2 (4)Total change(3)% (1)%Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to decrease in cost of sales and amortization of purchase intangibles, offset by increases in excess and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in packaging costs associated with our CS6 products. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased primarily due to certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized in fiscal 2012. Excess and obsolete inventory increased primarily due to increased reserve requirements for Adobe Creative Suite 5 and Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 products necessitated by the launch of CS6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to decrease in royalty costs, offset by increase in amortization of purchase intangibles. Royalty costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in obligations to certain key vendors. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through acquisitions during fiscal 2011 and our Day acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2010. SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third-parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third-parties for rack space, power and similar items.

Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Efficient Frontier in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Hosted server costs increased primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and hosting expenses associated with the launch of our Creative Cloud services in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Also contributing to the increase in hosted server costs is the increase in depreciation expense from higher capital expenditures in prior years and data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud services and Creative Cloud.Cost of subscription revenue remained relatively stable during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreased amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Omniture that were fully amortized in fiscal 2011. This was offset in part by increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and increases in data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. 65Table of ContentsServices and SupportCost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount, including headcount from our acquisition of Efficient Frontier.Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Research and development $742.8 $738.1 $680.3 1% 8 %Percentage of total revenue 17% 18% 18% Sales and marketing 1,516.1 1,385.8 1,244.2 9% 11 %Percentage of total revenue 34% 33% 33% General and administrative 435.0 414.6 383.5 5% 8 %Percentage of total revenue 10% 10% 10% Restructuring and other related charges (credits) (2.9) 97.8 23.3 * *Percentage of total revenue —% 2% 1% Amortization of purchased intangibles 48.7 42.8 72.1 14% (41)%Percentage of total revenue 1% 1% 2% Total operating expenses $2,739.7 $2,679.1 $2,403.4 2% 11 %_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is greater than 100%.Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by higher employee compensation associated with headcount growth.We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool and service offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs.

Professional and consulting fees increased during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to increase in fees for various technology projects and increased litigation expense. Restructuring and Other Related Charges (Credits)During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. During fiscal 2012, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $17.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. We also recorded $20.3 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2011, in connection with our 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $85.6 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities as well as $12.7 million related to the write-off of certain assets that were no longer useful to the company based on changes in our business. We also recorded minor favorable adjustments for changes in previous estimates. During 2010, in connection with our Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan we recorded $23.3 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities which is net of minor favorable adjustments for changes in previous estimates.See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.Amortization of Purchased IntangiblesDuring the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions including Macromedia in fiscal 2006, Omniture in fiscal 2009, Day in fiscal 2010, eight smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2011 and Efficient Frontier in fiscal 2012. As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years. Amortization expense increased 14% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our smaller acquisitions in fiscal 2011 and Efficient Frontier in fiscal 2012.Amortization expense decreased 41% during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Macromedia that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2010. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in amortization expense as a result of intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Day in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as well as an increase in intangible assets purchased through our fiscal 2011 acquisitions.67Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Interest and other income (expense), net $(3.4) $(3.0) $13.1 13 % (123)%Percentage of total revenue * * * Interest expense (67.5) (67.0) (56.9) 1 % 18 %Percentage of total revenue (2)% (2)% (1)% Investment gains (losses), net 9.5 5.9 (6.1) 61 % (197)%Percentage of total revenue * * * Total non-operating income (expense), net $(61.4) $(64.1) $(49.9) (4)% 28 %_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Yen currencies, and gains and losses on fixed income investments.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in net expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower average interest rates on our investments. Interest and other income (expense), net changed from net income in fiscal 2010 to net expense in fiscal 2011 primarily due to a gain of $20.8 million recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with a forward contract purchased to hedge our economic exposure related to our acquisition of Day that did not recur during fiscal 2011, as well as increased cash flow hedging costs in fiscal 2011. The increase in net expense in fiscal 2011 was partially offset by increased interest income of $2.4 million due to higher average interest rates on our investments.Interest ExpenseIn February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes” and, together with the 2015 Notes, the “Notes”). On February 1, 2010, we repaid the outstanding balance under our then existing $1.0 billion credit facility with a portion of the proceeds from the Notes. Interest expense remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase in interest expense during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to interest associated with higher borrowings resulting from the issuance of the Notes. Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. Investment gains (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010Net gains (losses) related to our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies $(0.2) $5.3 $(11.3)Gains from sale of marketable equity securities 8.2 0.8 4.0Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of ourmarketable equity securities (0.1) (0.2) —Net gains related to our trading securities 1.6 — 1.2Total investment gains (losses), net $9.5 $5.9 $(6.1) 68Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2012, total investment gains (losses), net improved primarily due to an increase in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities. This was offset in part by a decrease in realized gains related to our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2011 that did not recur during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, total investment gains (losses), net improved to net gains primarily due to unrealized losses related to our indirect investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2010 that did not recur during fiscal 2011. This was offset in part by a decrease in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities during fiscal 2011 due to less sales of these investments.Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Change2012-2011 % Change2011-2010Provision $286.0 $202.4 $168.5 41% 20%Percentage of total revenue 6% 5% 4% Effective tax rate 26% 20% 18% Our effective tax rate increased by approximately six percentage points during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011, the increase was primarily related to the expiration of the U.S. research and development credit, as well as tax benefits associated with a favorable state income tax ruling and tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe's trading companies.Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to tax costs of licensing acquired company assets to Adobe's trading companies. These costs were partially offset by tax benefits related to a favorable state income tax ruling and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit.In January 2013, the United States Congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit through December 31, 2013. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 30, 2012 was $160.5 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 30, 2012 were recognized in the future, $147.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $12.9 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns.As of November 30, 2012, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $12.5 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million.69Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)November 30, 2012 December 2, 2011Cash and cash equivalents$1,425.1 $989.5Short-term investments$2,113.3 $1,922.2Working capital$3,059.6 $2,520.7Stockholders’ equity$6,665.2 $5,783.1A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010Net cash provided by operating activities$1,499.6 $1,543.3 $1,113.0Net cash used for investing activities(834.7) (757.4) (1,159.3)Net cash used for financing activities(234.7) (550.4) (215.3)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents5.4 4.1 12.0Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$435.6 $239.6 $(249.6) Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the ESPP. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to an increase in activity for both upgrade plans with support and site and term licenses largely associated with our Digital Media and Digital Marketing enterprise license agreements. The decrease in trade receivables is primarily related to an increase in revenue linearity and improved collections in our Digital Marketing portfolio offset in part by higher revenue levels due to the CS6 product release which occurred late in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued restructuring and trade payables. Decreases in accrued restructuring primarily related to payments and adjustments for employee terminations and facility exit costs associated with the Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan, a significant portion of which were paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012. Trade payables decreased primarily due to the timing of payments as a greater number of invoices were paid prior to the fiscal year end in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued restructuring. Increases in deferred revenue related primarily to an overall increase in billing activity for maintenance and support/upgrade plans, hosted and professional services and site and term licenses. Accrued restructuring increased primarily due to recognition of liabilities related to employee termination and facility exit costs associated with the Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 for which a majority was paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012. The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2011 were increases in trade receivables coupled with decreases in accrued expenses and taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of overall higher sales levels and billing occurring during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, offset in part by an increased rate of collection for Digital Marketing services. Decreases in accrued expenses were primarily related to lower accrued bonus levels in fiscal 2011, coupled with payment of our second and third semi-annual interest payments associated with our Notes totaling $62.3 million. The resulting reduction in accrued interest was partially offset by additional interest accruals made during the period. Taxes payable decreased primarily due to the resolution of a Canadian Tax audit offset in part by quarterly increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. 70Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2010, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2010 annual incentive plan and interest on our Notes, both of which were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we made our first semi-annual interest payment associated with our Notes totaling $31.1 million. The resulting reduction in accrued interest was partially offset by additional interest accruals made during the period. Increases in deferred revenue related primarily to activity from our acquisition of Omniture, the related renewal of calendar-year based contracts in addition to increases in maintenance and support orders and royalty revenue deferrals related to changes in customer billing terms. The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2010 were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as decreases in taxes payable, accrued restructuring and trade payables. Trade receivables increased as a result of products shipped and billed during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of the launch of Acrobat X and slower receivable payments pertaining to Omniture services. Increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets related primarily to higher valuations on our cash flow and balance sheet hedges due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments of approximately $200.0 million for tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings as well as a $20.0 million settlement of an IRS exam in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments made related to the fiscal 2009 restructuring plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 in addition to adjustments made to previously recorded estimates, offset in part by new charges.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2012, net cash used for investing activities of $834.7 million was primarily due to our acquisition of Efficient Frontier in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2012 represented purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of Efficient Frontier. For fiscal 2011, net cash used for investing activities of $757.4 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and multiple business acquisitions, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2011 represented purchases of property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, intangibles and other assets. For fiscal 2010, net cash used for investing activities of $1.2 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and the acquisition of Day, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2010 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets. These uses of cash were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of equipment under our sale lease-back transaction and the sale of long-term investments. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our sale lease-back transaction. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, net cash used for financing activities of $234.7 million and $550.4 million, respectively, was primarily due to treasury stock repurchases offset in part by proceeds from our treasury stock issuances. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.For fiscal 2010, the primary cash flows from financing activities represented the issuance of $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. On February 1, 2010, we paid the outstanding balance on our then existing credit facility with a portion of the funds from our Notes. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2010 were for treasury stock repurchases offset in part by proceeds from our treasury stock issuances.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. RestructuringDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. During fiscal 2012 the following five restructuring plans, two of which were the result of large acquisitions, were still active:•Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan•Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan•Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan•Omniture Restructuring Plan•Macromedia Restructuring Plan71Table of ContentsAs of November 30, 2012, we have accrued total restructuring charges of approximately $21.6 million of which approximately $2.3 million relates to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations that are expected to be paid during fiscal 2013. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $19.3 million relate to the cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021, approximately 69% of which will be paid through 2015. During fiscal 2012, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately $63.1 million which consisted of approximately $50.5 million and $12.6 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.As of December 2, 2011, we accrued total restructuring charges of approximately $88.4 million of which approximately $74.4 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations which were paid or adjusted during fiscal 2012 with the remaining $14.0 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2011, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately $13.1 million which consisted of approximately $6.8 million and $6.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2013 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our business acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $3.5 billion as of November 30, 2012. Of this amount, approximately 83% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. As of November 30, 2012, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.5 billion. On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. As of November 30, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1.0 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, we terminated and paid off all obligations under our previous credit agreement dated as of February 16, 2007.We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 74% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2012. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements, municipal securities, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities.Stock Repurchase ProgramDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to our stock repurchase program authorized in April 2007 from a non-expiring share-based authority to a time-constrained dollar-based authority. As part of this amendment, the Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $1.6 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2012. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we exhausted our $1.6 billion time-constrained dollar-based authority granted by our Board of Directors in fiscal 2010. In April 2012, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting authority to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2015. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous $1.6 billion stock repurchase program.During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $405.0 million, $695.0 million and $850.0 million, respectively. Of the $405.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2012, $100.0 million was under the new $2.0 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $305.0 million was under our previous $1.6 billion authority. Of the $850.0 million of 72Table of Contentsprepayments during fiscal 2010, $250.0 million was under the stock repurchase program prior to the program amendment and the remaining $600.0 million was under our $1.6 billion authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 11.5 million shares at an average price of $32.29 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at an average price of $31.81 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 31.2 million shares at an average price per share of $29.19 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 30, 2012, December 2, 2011 and December 3, 2010 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 30, 2012, $33.0 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. As of December 2, 2011 and December 3, 2010, no prepayments remained under the agreements. Subsequent to November 30, 2012, as part of our $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $100.0 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $100.0 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.8 billion remains under our current authority. See Notes 13 and 20 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 30, 2012.Summary of Stock Repurchases for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands, except average amounts)Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2012 2011 2010 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageDecember 1997 From employees(1) 1 $33.57 1 $35.66 Structured repurchases(2) — $— — $— 9,358 $33.11June 2010 Structured repurchases(2) 9,482 $32.17 21,849 $31.81 21,807 $27.51April 2012 Structured repurchases(2) 2,038 $32.87 — $— — $—Total shares 11,520 $32.29 21,850 $31.81 31,166 $29.19Total cost $371,995 $695,015 $909,900 _________________________________________ (1) The repurchases from employees represent shares canceled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due.(2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See Stock Repurchase Program above.73Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 30, 2012 consist of obligations under operating leases, capital leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2012 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsNotes $1,869.5 $62.3 $714.8 $85.5 $1,006.9Operating lease obligations 246.1 47.3 73.0 46.7 79.1Capital lease obligations 13.2 11.4 1.8 — —Purchase obligations 342.2 256.4 46.5 27.3 12.0Total $2,471.0 $377.4 $836.1 $159.5 $1,098.0Senior NotesIn February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2010. During fiscal 2012 interest payments totaled $62.3 million. At November 30, 2012, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $369.4 million. Capital Lease ObligationIn June 2010, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling $32.2 million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of 43 months. This transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and was recorded at fair value.CovenantsOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of November 30, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 30, 2012 was $160.5 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million. RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.74Table of ContentsGuaranteesThe lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. The fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. The balance was amortized to our Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the original leases. As of November 30, 2012 there was no remaining balance of the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees, for either lease, remaining on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the U.S., we transact business in U.S. dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Additionally, we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts to hedge our Euro- , Yen-, or British Pound-denominated revenue.Our revenue exposures for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in millions, except Yen): Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010Euro€530.7 €557.6 €542.9Yen (in billions)¥34.8 ¥34.7 ¥35.6British Pounds£145.1 £144.8 £123.9Our European operating expenses are primarily in Euro and our Japanese operating expenses are primarily in Yen, which naturally mitigates a portion of the exposure related to our Euro- and Yen-denominated product revenue. We hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and/or forward contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. In addition, we hedge our net monetary assets and liabilities using forward contracts. These contracts subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. As of November 30, 2012, the total absolute value of outstanding contracts was $937.2 million which included the notional equivalent of $476.5 million in Euro, $220.7 million in Yen and $240.0 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of November 30, 2012, all contracts were set to expire at various times through June 2013. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty.We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 30, 2012 and December 2, 2011, this long-term investment exposure 75Table of Contentstotaled a notional equivalent of $419.6 million and $481.4 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted TransactionsWe may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, Yen, and British Pound. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2012, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 30, 2012, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 30, 2012. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $64.0 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $35.1 million.We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis.We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.76Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 30, 2012, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $2.1 billion.

The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.Marketable Equity SecuritiesWe have immaterial exposure to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 30, 2012, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $0.2 million compared to $12.3 million at December 2, 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the disposal of certain of our equity holdings during fiscal 2012.77Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:11.238918
796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology for $616.7 million and privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work for $111.1 million. During fiscal 2013, we began integrating Neolane and Behance into our Digital Marketing and Digital Media reportable segments, respectively. The impact of these acquisitions were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2012, we completed the acquisition of privately held Efficient Frontier, a multi-channel digital ad buying and optimization company for $374.7 million. During fiscal 2012, we began integrating Efficient Frontier into our Digital Marketing segment. During fiscal 2011, we completed six business combinations and two asset acquisitions with aggregate purchase prices totaling $328.3 million. We have included the financial results of the business combinations in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the licensing of perpetual, time-based and subscription software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosting services, consulting services, training and technical support.We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosting services and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the 35Table of Contentselements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training.For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. 36Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and•discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill ImpairmentWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and determined there was no impairment. The results of our annual impairment test indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates 37Table of Contentsto determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the FASB amended the accounting standards to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) by eliminating the option to present components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity and requires the components of OCI to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive statements. We adopted the amended accounting standards at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2013 by electing to present consolidated statements of comprehensive income separate from the consolidated statements of income.In February 2013, the FASB further amended the above accounting standards to improve the presentation of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in its entirety and by component by presenting the reclassification adjustments on either the face of the statement where net income is presented or in a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. Amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income are required to be cross referenced to related footnote disclosures that provide additional detail. We elected to early adopt the amended accounting standard at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2013 by electing to present the reclassification adjustments and other required disclosures in a separate footnote.The amended accounting standards only impact the financial statement presentation of OCI and do not change the components that are recognized in net income or OCI. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. 38Table of ContentsRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveThere have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2013For fiscal 2013, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering includes six solutions addressing the expanding needs of marketers, the newest of which is Adobe Campaign—a cross-channel campaign management tool that we added to our portfolio with the acquisition of Neolane during our third quarter of fiscal 2013.Revenue from Adobe Marketing Cloud increased 26% and 35% during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the year ago periods. Helping to drive this performance was strong adoption of our Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”) offering and the addition of Neolane in mid-third quarter of fiscal 2013.AEM, our fastest growing digital marketing solution, has typically been licensed by our customers as an on-premise offering where license revenue is recognized at the time of the transaction. In the past year, we introduced a managed services offering of AEM for which revenue is recognized ratably. We expect continued adoption of the newer managed services offering, which will increasingly migrate AEM revenue to recurring revenue in this segment. Given the comparisons involving more new license revenue being recognized over time versus past license revenue being recognized up front, we anticipate this trend may impact overall Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue in the near term.Within our Digital Media segment, in May 2012 we delivered Adobe Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud is our next-generation offering that supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to the offering. Key aspects of the value Creative Cloud provides include more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, community-based features and services through our acquisition of Behance in December 2012, digital publishing and app creation capabilities, and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.In May 2013 we announced we would exclusively deliver new creative product innovations and features to Creative Cloud subscribers, and that Adobe Creative Suite 6 (“CS6”), which was released in May 2012, would be the last major update we provide for perpetual licensees. While we continue to offer CS6 on a perpetual licensing basis moving forward, we expect revenue for it to sequentially decline as our customers increasingly migrate to Creative Cloud.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire Creative Cloud capabilities through Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”). The three Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud is transforming our business model and we expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. This model will drive our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.We have implemented, and will continue to implement, strategies that accelerate adoption of our Creative Cloud subscription model, causing our traditional perpetual license revenue to decline. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud.During fiscal 2013, adoption of our Creative Cloud subscription offering continued to accelerate, which has and will continue to cause our traditional perpetual license revenue to decline and, in turn, has caused total net revenue in fiscal 2013 to decline compared with fiscal 2012. As anticipated, during this transition expenses did not and are not expected to decline in correlation to the decrease in revenue, which has adversely affected our net income and operating margin throughout fiscal 2013. However, over time we expect this business model transition will significantly increase our long-term revenue growth rate by attracting new 39Table of Contentsusers, keeping our end user base current and thereby driving higher revenue. Additionally, our shift to a subscription model will increase the amount of recurring revenue that is ratably recognized, driven by broader Creative Cloud adoption over the next several years. We began to see the impact of this shift in fiscal 2013. To assist with the understanding of this transition and the related shift in revenue described above, we are using certain performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment.These metrics include the total number of current paid subscriptions and Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”). We define ARR as the sum of:•the number of current paid subscriptions, multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month, multiplied by twelve months; plus,•twelve months of contract value of ETLAs where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract.ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We exited fiscal 2013 with 1.4 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up from 0.3 million at the end of fiscal 2012. Total Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2013 was $768.0 million, up from $155.0 million exiting fiscal 2012, demonstrating the progress we have made with our transformation in this business.Our Digital Media business also includes our Document Services products and solutions, including Acrobat. In fiscal 2013 we continued to drive solid adoption of our Acrobat family of products primarily through license agreements with enterprise customers. During fiscal 2013, a higher percentage of these agreements were ETLAs, which like ETLAs with our creative customers, cause more revenue to be recognized over time rather than at the time of contract signing. This has caused reported Document Services revenue in fiscal 2013 to decline compared to revenue achieved in fiscal 2012, with the benefit of ETLAs improving our growth potential over time. In addition to Acrobat, we also drove strong adoption of subscription based services including Acrobat cloud services and our EchoSign e-signing solution. Combined, adoption of Acrobat through ETLAs and our Document Services subscription offerings helped grow Document Services ARR to $143.0 million exiting fiscal 2013, up from $49.0 million at the end of fiscal 2012.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2013•We continue to derive the majority of our revenue from perpetual licenses. However, consistent with our strategy, during fiscal 2013, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 28% from 15% and 11% as compared to fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, as we transition more of our business to a subscription-based model.•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $911.0 million as of November 29, 2013 increased by approximately $707.0 million, or 347%, from approximately $204.0 million as of November 30, 2012. The increase in our Digital Media ARR is primarily due to increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions and adoption of our enterprise Creative Cloud offering through our ETLAs.•Our total deferred revenue of $828.8 million as of November 29, 2013 increased by $209.2 million, or 34% from November 30, 2012, primarily due to increases in ETLAs and renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. •Cost of revenue of $586.6 million increased by $102.8 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2013, from $483.8 million in fiscal 2012, and $45.9 million or 10% during fiscal 2012 from $437.9 million in fiscal 2011. These increases are primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and increased hosting and server costs associated with our subscription and SaaS offerings.•Operating expenses of $3,046.0 million increased by $306.3 million or 11%, during fiscal 2013, from $2,739.7 million in fiscal 2012, and $60.6 million, or 2% in fiscal 2012 from $2,679.1 million in fiscal 2011. These increases are primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount. •Net income of $290.0 million decreased by $542.8 million, or 65%, during fiscal 2013 from $832.8 million in fiscal 2012. The decrease is primarily due to the revenue model becoming more ratable as well as the cost and expense increases stated above. Net income during fiscal 2012 remained stable compared to fiscal 2011. 40Table of Contents•Net cash flow from operations of $1,151.7 million during fiscal 2013 decreased by $347.9 million, or 23%, as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower net income as discussed above. Net cash flow from operations during fiscal 2012 remained stable compared to fiscal 2011.Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Product $2,470.1 $3,342.8 $3,416.5 (26)% (2)%Percentage of total revenue 61% 76% 81% Subscription 1,137.9 673.2 458.6 69 % 47 %Percentage of total revenue 28% 15% 11% Services and support 447.2 387.7 341.2 15 % 14 %Percentage of total revenue 11% 9% 8% Total revenue $4,055.2 $4,403.7 $4,216.3 (8)% 4 %As described in Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have the following segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing.Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including certain of our Adobe Marketing Cloud services and Creative Cloud. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning on the commencement of the service. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new SaaS and subscription models. We also expect this to increase the amount of recurring revenue we generate as a percent of our total revenue. Of the $1,137.9 million, $673.2 million and $458.6 million in subscription revenue for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, approximately $663.1 million, $553.2 million and $429.2 million, respectively, is from our Digital Marketing segment, with the remaining amounts substantially representing our Digital Media segment offerings. Our services and support revenue is comprised of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products and the sale of our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.Segments In fiscal 2013, we categorized our products into the following segments:•Digital Media—Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. •Digital Marketing—Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officers and chief revenue officers.•Print and Publishing—Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse authoring and publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. 41Table of ContentsSegment Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Digital Media $2,625.9 $3,101.9 $3,070.2 (15)% 1 %Percentage of total revenue 65% 70% 73% Digital Marketing 1,228.8 1,085.0 927.8 13 % 17 %Percentage of total revenue 30% 25% 22% Print and Publishing 200.5 216.8 218.3 (8)% (1)%Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 5% Total revenue $4,055.2 $4,403.7 $4,216.3 (8)% 4 %Fiscal 2013 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2012 RevenueDigital MediaRevenue from Digital Media decreased $476.0 million during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to continued strong adoption of Creative Cloud and ETLAs as we continue to transition more of our business to a subscription-based model. Revenue related to our creative professional products, which include our Creative Suite editions and CS point products as well as Creative Cloud, decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to continued customer adoption of Creative Cloud subscription offerings, released in May 2012. We continue to anticipate accelerated adoption of Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises, for which revenue is recognized over time, and that this adoption has and will continue to cause our traditional perpetual license revenue to decline. Revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increases associated with distribution of third-party software via Flash Player downloads and our Digital Publishing Suite. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Photoshop Elements family of products.For our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed decreased while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Unit average selling prices for our perpetual units licensed decreased during the year ended fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Document Services revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the continued shift to ETLAs offset by increased Document Exchange Services revenue including revenue generated from our EchoSign e-signing service. Within Document Services, excluding large enterprise license agreement deals, the number of units licensed decreased while the unit average selling prices increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $143.8 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 26% during fiscal 2013, as compared to the year ago period and includes Adobe Campaign revenue from our recent acquisition of Neolane. The increase noted above was partially offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our legacy products during fiscal 2013.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased ETLAs for some products in this group. Fiscal 2012 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenue Digital MediaRevenue from Digital Media remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, due to solid demand for our Acrobat family of products as well as the continued momentum of the CS6 launch in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, offset by better than expected growth associated with our subscription offerings. 42Table of ContentsRevenue related to our creative professional products, which included our Creative Suite editions and CS point products as well as Creative Cloud, decreased slightly during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to higher than expected customer adoption of Creative Cloud and point product subscriptions. The decreases in revenue associated with our creative professional products were offset in part by growth associated with the May 2012 release of new Photoshop point products for which the previous release occurred in fiscal 2010.Revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increases associated with third-party toolbar distribution via Flash Player downloads as well as continued demand related to the May 2012 release of Adobe Lightroom 4. For our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed remained relatively stable while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Unit average selling prices for our perpetual units licensed decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.Document Services revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, also increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased Document Exchange Services revenue including revenue generated from our EchoSign e-signing service and the launch of Adobe Acrobat XI in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Within Document Services, excluding large enterprise license agreement deals, the number of units licensed remained relatively stable while the unit average selling prices increased for our Acrobat offerings for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $157.2 million, or 17% during fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to continued growth of our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 35% year-over-year and includes revenue generated from products associated with our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Efficient Frontier. Also contributing to the growth in revenue was our Adobe Connect hosted offering. As expected, increases in these areas were offset in part by a decrease in revenue associated with Adobe LiveCycle product offerings as we continued to shift our focus to our Adobe Marketing Cloud.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue, offset by increases in fees received for consulting services and royalties related to PostScript products.Geographical Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Americas $2,134.4 $2,196.4 $2,044.6 (3)% 7 %Percentage of total revenue 53% 50% 49% EMEA 1,129.2 1,294.6 1,317.4 (13)% (2)%Percentage of total revenue 28% 29% 31% APAC 791.6 912.7 854.3 (13)% 7 %Percentage of total revenue 19% 21% 20% Total revenue $4,055.2 $4,403.7 $4,216.3 (8)% 4 %Fiscal 2013 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2012 Revenue by GeographyRevenue declined across all geographies during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Revenue in the Americas and APAC decreased during fiscal 2013 due to decreases in Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue, offset in part by increases in Digital Marketing revenue. Revenue in EMEA decreased during fiscal 2013 due to decreases in Digital Media revenue, offset in part by increases in Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue. Within each geographical region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.Fiscal 2012 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenue by GeographyOverall revenue for fiscal 2012 increased in the Americas and APAC and declined slightly in EMEA when compared to fiscal 2011. Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2012 primarily due to revenue increases in Digital Media and Digital Marketing, offset slightly by a decline in Print and Publishing revenue. Despite the launch of CS6 in May 2012, the economic 43Table of Contentsconditions in Europe and the weakening of the Euro and British Pound against the U.S. Dollar caused revenue in EMEA to decline slightly during fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. Revenue in APAC increased across all reportable segments during fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011. Within each geographical region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact to revenue measured in EMEA currencies as the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against these currencies. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2013 as noted in the table above.During fiscal 2012, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA currencies causing revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease compared with the same reporting period last year. This decrease was offset in part by the favorable impact to revenue measured in Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies as the U.S. Dollar weakened against these currencies. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2012 as noted in the table above. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.Product BacklogThe actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. We expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancellable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of November 29, 2013, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $1.0 billion. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change period over period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes 44Table of Contentsin customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.Cost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Product $138.2 $121.7 $125.7 14% (3)%Percentage of total revenue 3% 3% 3% Subscription 278.1 219.1 194.0 27% 13 %Percentage of total revenue 7% 5% 5% Services and support 170.3 143.0 118.2 19% 21 %Percentage of total revenue 4% 3% 3% Total cost of revenue $586.6 $483.8 $437.9 21% 10 %ProductCost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.Fluctuations in cost of product revenue are due to the following: % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements 27 % (1)%Cost of sales(8) (6)Excess and obsolete inventory(4) 2Various individually insignificant items(1) 2Total change14 % (3)%Cost of product revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements offset by decreases in cost of sales and excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements increased as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $51.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Of this cost, an estimated $25.3 million was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years. We estimated that the remaining cost of approximately $26.5 million was related to historical use of licensing rights and was expensed as cost of product revenue in fiscal 2013. In connection with certain of these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Cost of sales primarily decreased due to the decrease in the number of perpetual units sold and packaging costs associated with our CS6 products. During May 2013, we announced that, while we will continue to offer and support CS6 products, we plan to focus our future creative development efforts on our Creative Cloud offering. Excess and obsolete inventory decreased due to decreased reserve requirements for CS6 as we continue to transition to more of a subscription based model.Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to decrease in cost of sales and amortization of purchase intangibles, offset by increases in excess and obsolete inventory. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in packaging costs associated with our CS6 products. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased primarily due to certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized in fiscal 2012. Excess and obsolete inventory increased primarily due to increased reserve requirements for Adobe Creative Suite 5 and Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 products necessitated by the launch of CS6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third-parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third-parties for rack space, power and similar items. 45Table of ContentsCost of subscription revenue increased due to the following: % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Hosted server costs23% 7%Amortization of purchased intangibles4 6Total change27% 13%Cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased hosted server costs and amortization of purchased intangibles. Hosted server costs increased primarily due to increases in data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services, depreciation expense from higher capital expenditures in prior years and compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount, including from our acquisition of Neolane in fiscal 2013. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets purchased associated with our acquisitions of Behance and Neolane in fiscal 2013. Cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased hosted server costs and amortization of purchased intangibles. Hosted server costs increased primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and hosting expenses associated with the launch of our Creative Cloud services in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Also contributing to the increase in hosted server costs is the increase in depreciation expense from higher capital expenditures in prior years and data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Efficient Frontier in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.Services and SupportCost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increases in third-party fees related to training and consulting services provided to our customers and compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount, including headcount from our acquisition of Neolane in fiscal 2013.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount, including headcount from our acquisition of Efficient Frontier.Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Research and development $826.6 $742.8 $738.1 11% 1%Percentage of total revenue 20% 17% 18% Sales and marketing 1,620.5 1,516.1 1,385.8 7% 9%Percentage of total revenue 40% 34% 33% General and administrative 520.1 435.0 414.6 20% 5%Percentage of total revenue 13% 10% 10% Restructuring and other related charges (credits) 26.5 (2.9) 97.8 * *Percentage of total revenue 1% —% 2% Amortization of purchased intangibles 52.3 48.7 42.8 7% 14%Percentage of total revenue 1% 1% 1% Total operating expenses $3,046.0 $2,739.7 $2,679.1 11% 2%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is greater than 100%. 46Table of ContentsResearch and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The increase in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily due to higher incentive compensation program achievement in fiscal 2013, increases in stock-based compensation expense due to higher share prices during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as well as a shorter vesting term, which decreased from four years to three years, for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process during the first quarter of fiscal 2013.Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.Research and development expenses increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to the following: % Change2013-2012Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount3%Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation7Various individually insignificant items1Total change11%Research and development expenses remained relatively stable during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool and service offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs.

Professional and consulting fees decreased during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to decreased litigation expense. Restructuring and Other ChargesDuring May 2013, we began to actively market the Waltham property assets and we expected to sell the property within one year from management's approval of the plan. We classified the Waltham property assets with a total carrying amount of $47.4 million as held for sale at $23.6 million representing their fair value, net of estimated costs to sell which was the lesser of the fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount of the assets. We recorded a write-down of $23.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We ceased recognizing depreciation expense on the Waltham property assets upon reclassification which would have been minimal for fiscal 2013. In September 2013, we finalized the sale of the Waltham property assets for net proceeds of $24.3 million which approximated the carrying value of the assets at the time of sale.During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. During fiscal 2013, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $6.3 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. We also recorded $3.0 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2012, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $17.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. We also recorded $20.3 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2011, in connection with our 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $85.6 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities as well as $12.7 million related to the write-off of certain assets that were no longer useful to the company based on changes in our business. We also recorded minor favorable adjustments for changes in previous estimates. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.Amortization of Purchased IntangiblesDuring the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions including Omniture in fiscal 2009, Day in fiscal 2010, Efficient Frontier in fiscal 2012, and Behance and Neolane in fiscal 2013. As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years. Amortization expense increased 7% during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Behance and Neolane in fiscal 2013.Amortization expense increased 14% during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier in fiscal 2012. 48Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Interest and other income (expense), net $4.9 $(3.4) $(3.0) * 13 %Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Interest expense (67.5) (67.5) (67.0) — % 1 %Percentage of total revenue (2)% (2)% (2)% Investment gains (losses), net (4.0) 9.5 5.9 (142)% 61 %Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Total non-operating income (expense), net $(66.6) $(61.4) $(64.1) 8 % (4)%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.(**) Percentage is less than 1%.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from hedging Euro, British Pounds and Yen currencies.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in net income in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased foreign exchange losses.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in net expense in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower average interest rates on our investments. Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Interest expense has remained relatively stable for all fiscal years presented. Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. Investment gains (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable and non-marketable equity securities $(7.0) $(0.1) $(0.2)Net gains related to our trading securities 3.0 1.6 —Net gains (losses) related to our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies — (0.2) 5.3Gains from sale of marketable equity securities — 8.2 0.8Total investment gains (losses), net $(4.0) $9.5 $5.9 During fiscal 2013, total investment gains (losses), net decreased to net losses primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities and an increase in write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies.During fiscal 2012, total investment gains (losses), net improved primarily due to an increase in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities. This was offset in part by a decrease in realized gains related to our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2011 that did not recur during fiscal 2012. 49Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 % Change2013-2012 % Change2012-2011Provision $66.2 $286.0 $202.4 (77)% 41%Percentage of total revenue 2% 6% 5% Effective tax rate 19% 26% 20% Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease is primarily related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. research and development credit which resulted in the credits for both fiscal 2012 and 2013 being reflected in the fiscal 2013 results. Our effective tax rate increased by approximately six percentage points during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The rate increase in fiscal 2012 was primarily related to the expiration of the U.S. research and development credit in fiscal 2011, as well as items in fiscal 2011 including tax benefits associated with a favorable state income tax ruling and tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe's trading companies that were not present in fiscal 2012.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 29, 2013 was $136.1 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 29, 2013 were recognized in the future, $125.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $10.5 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns.As of November 29, 2013, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $11.4 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million.In July 2013, a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was completed. Our accrued tax and interest related to these years was $48.4 million and was previously reported in long-term income taxes payable. We settled the tax obligation resulting from this examination with cash and income tax assets totaling $41.2 million, and the resulting $7.2 million income tax benefit was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)November 29, 2013 November 30, 2012Cash and cash equivalents$834.6 $1,425.1Short-term investments$2,339.2 $2,113.3Working capital$2,520.3 $3,125.3Stockholders’ equity$6,724.6 $6,665.2 50Table of ContentsA summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011Net cash provided by operating activities$1,151.7 $1,499.6 $1,543.3Net cash used for investing activities(1,177.8) (834.7) (757.4)Net cash used for financing activities(559.1) (234.7) (550.4)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(5.2) 5.4 4.1Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(590.4) $435.6 $239.6 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,151.7 million was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our Creative Cloud offering and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission accruals associated with higher achievement levels. Trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in taxes payable is largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of R&D and foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,499.6 million was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to an increase in activity for both upgrade plans with support and site and term licenses largely associated with our Digital Media and Digital Marketing enterprise license agreements. The decrease in trade receivables is primarily related to an increase in revenue linearity and improved collections in our Digital Marketing portfolio offset in part by higher revenue levels due to the CS6 product release which occurred late in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued restructuring and trade payables. Decreases in accrued restructuring primarily related to payments and adjustments for employee terminations and facility exit costs associated with the Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan, a significant portion of which were paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012. Trade payables decreased primarily due to the timing of payments as a greater number of invoices were paid prior to the fiscal year end in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,543.3 million was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued restructuring. Increases in deferred revenue related primarily to an overall increase in billing activity for maintenance and support/upgrade plans, hosted and professional services and site and term licenses. Accrued restructuring increased primarily due to recognition of liabilities related to employee termination and facility exit costs associated with the Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 for which a majority was paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012. The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2011 were increases in trade receivables coupled with decreases in accrued expenses and taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of overall higher sales levels and billing occurring during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, offset in part by an increased rate of collection for Digital Marketing services. Decreases in accrued expenses were primarily related to lower accrued bonus levels in fiscal 2011, coupled with payment of our second and third semi-annual interest payments associated with our Notes totaling $62.3 million. The resulting reduction in accrued interest was partially offset by additional interest accruals made during the period. Taxes payable decreased 51Table of Contentsprimarily due to the resolution of a Canadian Tax audit offset in part by quarterly increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1,177.8 million was primarily due to our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment associated with our construction projects in Oregon and India and purchases of long-term technology licenses. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of the Waltham Property. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance. For fiscal 2012, net cash used for investing activities of $834.7 million was primarily due to our acquisition of Efficient Frontier in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2012 represented purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of Efficient Frontier. For fiscal 2011, net cash used for investing activities of $757.4 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and multiple business acquisitions, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2011 represented purchases of property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, intangibles and other assets. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, net cash used for financing activities of $559.1 million, $234.7 million and $550.4 million, respectively, was primarily due to treasury stock repurchases offset in part by proceeds from our treasury stock issuances. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. RestructuringDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. Currently, we have two active restructuring plans that were of significance to us:•Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan•Fiscal 2009 Restructuring PlanAs of November 29, 2013, we have accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million of which approximately $11.7 million relates to cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021. Approximately 54% of these facility closing costs will be paid through 2015. During fiscal 2013, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling $10.3 million which consisted of $1.3 million and $9.0 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.As of November 30, 2012, we accrued total restructuring charges of $21.6 million of which $2.3 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $19.3 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2012, we made payments related to restructuring plans totaling $63.1 million which consisted of $50.5 million and $12.6 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2014 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our business acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $3.2 billion as of November 29, 2013. Of this amount, approximately 80% was held by our foreign 52Table of Contentssubsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. As of November 29, 2013, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.5 billion. On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. As of November 29, 2013, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1.0 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 77% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2013. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, municipal securities and foreign government securities.In September 2013, we finalized the sale of the Waltham property assets for net proceeds of $24.3 million. The sale price, net of costs to sell, approximated the carrying value of the assets at the time of sale. See Note 6 for further details regarding our assets held for sale.Stock Repurchase ProgramWe currently have authority granted by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2015. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous $1.6 billion stock repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in fiscal 2010.During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.1 billion, $405.0 million and $695.0 million, respectively. The $1.1 billion prepayments during fiscal 2013 were under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase authority. Of the $405.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2012, $100.0 million were under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $305.0 million were under our previous $1.6 billion stock repurchase authority. The $695.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2011 were under the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 11.5 million shares at an average price of $32.29 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 21.8 million shares at an average price per share of $31.81 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 29, 2013, November 30, 2012 and December 2, 2011 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 29, 2013, $129.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to November 29, 2013, as part of our $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200.0 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200.0 million stock 53Table of Contentsrepurchase agreement, $600.0 million remains under our current authority. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 29, 2013.Summary of Stock Repurchases for Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except average amounts)Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2013 2012 2011 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageDecember 1997 From employees(1) — $— 1 $33.57 Structured repurchases(2) — $— — $— — $—June 2010 Structured repurchases(2) — $— 9,482 $32.17 21,849 $31.81April 2012 Structured repurchases(2) 21,603 $46.47 2,038 $32.87 — $—Total shares 21,603 $46.47 11,520 $32.29 21,850 $31.81Total cost $1,003,794 $371,995 $695,015 _________________________________________ (1) The repurchases from employees represent shares canceled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due.(2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See Stock Repurchase Program above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 29, 2013 consist of obligations under operating leases, capital leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 29, 2013 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsNotes $1,807.2 $62.3 $695.3 $85.5 $964.1Operating lease obligations 214.1 47.2 62.8 43.7 60.4Capital lease obligations 18.2 14.9 3.3 — —Purchase obligations 498.3 390.8 80.8 16.7 10.0Total $2,537.8 $515.2 $842.2 $145.9 $1,034.5Senior NotesIn February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2010. During fiscal 2013 interest payments totaled $62.3 million. At November 29, 2013, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $307.1 million. Capital Lease ObligationIn the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement totaling $25.7 million over a period of 24 months. This transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and was recorded at fair value.CovenantsOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of November 29, 2013, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. 54Table of ContentsUnder the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 29, 2013 was $136.1 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million. RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the U.S., we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue denominated in Euro, British Pounds and Yen. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our revenue exposures for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows (in millions, except Yen): Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011Euro€434.7 €530.7 €557.6Yen (in billions)¥32.5 ¥34.8 ¥34.7British Pounds£145.3 £145.1 £144.8 55Table of ContentsAs of November 29, 2013, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $718.5 million which included the notional equivalent of $312.7 million in Euros, $104.2 million in British Pounds, $169.8 million in Yen and $131.8 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 29, 2013, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2014. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 29, 2013. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $34.6 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $9.3 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 29, 2013 and November 30, 2012, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $355.6 million and $419.6 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted TransactionsWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 29, 2013, net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur were insignificant.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 29, 2013, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. 56Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 29, 2013, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $2.3 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments.

The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.Marketable Equity SecuritiesWe have minimal exposure to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 29, 2013 and November 30, 2012, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were insignificant. 57Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:10.542730

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2014, we completed a business acquisition which was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.During fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology for $616.7 million and privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work for $111.1 million. During fiscal 2013, we integrated Neolane and Behance into our Digital Marketing and Digital Media reportable segments, respectively. The impact of these acquisitions was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2012, we completed the acquisition of privately held Efficient Frontier, a multi-channel digital ad buying and optimization company for $374.7 million. During fiscal 2012, we began integrating Efficient Frontier into our Digital Marketing segment. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the licensing of perpetual, time-based and subscription software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. 36Table of ContentsWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenues for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition 37Table of Contentsdate. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and•discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill ImpairmentWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and determined there was no impairment. The results of our annual impairment test indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic 38Table of Contentstax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by lapses of the availability of the U.S. research and development tax credit, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is not permitted. The updated standard becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. With the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2014For fiscal 2014, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud, first delivered in May 2012, is our next-generation offering that supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. Creative Cloud delivers value through more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users’ machines, community-based features and services through our acquisition of Behance in December 2012, app creation capabilities and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire Creative Cloud capabilities through Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”). The three Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple 39Table of Contentsroutes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our business model and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. This model drives our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offering. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Additionally, in May 2013 we announced we would exclusively deliver new creative product innovations and features to Creative Cloud subscribers, and that Adobe Creative Suite 6 (“CS6”), which was released in May 2012, would be the last major update we provide for perpetual licensees. In the first half of fiscal 2014, we announced the removal of general availability of CS6 on a perpetual licensing basis from legacy shrinkwrap and volume licensing channels. We still offer CS6 through our Adobe.com website and in certain markets.Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and ETLAs, perpetual revenue for CS6 has declined, and by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative professional products was immaterial.During fiscal 2014, we continued to experience strong adoption of our Creative Cloud subscription offerings which has caused our Creative Cloud subscription revenue to increase as compared to the year-ago period.To assist with an understanding of this transition, we are using certain performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. These metrics include the total number of current paid subscriptions and Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”). ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We plan to adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes.For our Creative business, we define Creative ARR as the sum of:•the number of current subscriptions, multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month, multiplied by twelve months; plus,•twelve months of contract value of ETLAs where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract; plus•twelve months of Adobe Digital Publishing Suite contract value where the revenue is ratably recognized.We exited fiscal 2014 with 3.454 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up 140% from 1.439 million at the end of fiscal 2013. Total Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2014 was $1.68 billion, up from $801 million at the end of fiscal 2013.Our Digital Media segment also includes our Document Services products and solutions, including Acrobat, Acrobat cloud services and EchoSign e-signing solution. In fiscal 2014 we continued to drive solid adoption of our Acrobat family of products primarily through license agreements with enterprise customers. We also drove strong adoption of subscription-based services including our Acrobat cloud services. Combined, adoption of Acrobat through ETLAs and our Document Services subscription offerings helped grow Document Services ARR to $271 million exiting fiscal 2014, up from $143 million at the end of fiscal 2013.Total Digital Media ARR, which we define as the sum of Creative ARR and Document Services ARR, grew to $1.95 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, up from $944 million at the end of fiscal 2013, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue model. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2014 are based on currency rates set at the start of the fiscal year and held constant throughout the year. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2014 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2015, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2014 would be $1.88 billion or approximately $72 million lower than ARR reported above.We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud includes six solutions addressing the expanding needs of marketers, the newest of which is Adobe Campaign—a cross-channel campaign management tool that we added to our portfolio with the acquisition of Neolane during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.Revenue from Adobe Marketing Cloud increased 15% during fiscal 2014 compared to the year-ago period. Helping to drive this performance was strong adoption across our portfolio of Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions including solid growth of our Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”) and Adobe Campaign offerings.AEM and Adobe Campaign have historically been licensed by our customers as on premise offerings where license revenue has been recognized at the time of the transactions. During fiscal 2014, we saw increased customer adoption of term-based licensing 40Table of Contentsof our AEM and Adobe Campaign solutions where revenue is booked and recognized ratably. We believe this is resulting in larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth.In evaluating our Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue performance, we believe it is important to understand this licensing and revenue mix shift that is occurring with AEM and Adobe Campaign. In fiscal 2013, approximately 45% of our AEM and Adobe Campaign contracts were term-based. Entering fiscal 2014, based on our goal of migrating more of these solutions to be term-based, we expected a mix of approximately 60% term-based contracts for AEM and Adobe Campaign this fiscal year. Due to strong execution and customer demand, we saw an acceleration of term-based adoption of AEM and Adobe Campaign in fiscal 2014 and these solutions achieved approximately 75% term-based contracts this year.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2014•Consistent with our strategy, during fiscal 2014, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 50% from 28% and 15% compared with fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, as we have transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.•We exited fiscal 2014 with 3.454 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up 140% from 1.439 million at the end of fiscal 2013.•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.95 billion as of November 28, 2014 increased by $1.00 billion, or 106%, from $944 million as of November 29, 2013. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions and adoption of our enterprise Creative Cloud offering through our ETLAs.•Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.17 billion increased by $154.3 million, or 15%, during fiscal 2014, from $1.02 billion in fiscal 2013, and $212.3 million, or 26%, during fiscal 2013 from $803.7 million in fiscal 2012. The increases were primarily due to strong adoption of our AEM offering and the addition of Neolane which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.•Our total deferred revenue of $1.16 billion as of November 28, 2014 increased by $326.5 million, or 39% from $828.8 million as of November 29, 2013, primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud subscriptions and ETLAs. To a lesser extent, new contracts and existing contract renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud services contributed to this increase as our retention rates for Adobe Marketing Cloud services have been improving slightly over time. •Cost of revenue of $622.1 million increased by $35.5 million, or 6%, during fiscal 2014, from $586.6 million in fiscal 2013, and $102.8 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2013 from $483.8 million in fiscal 2012. These increases were primarily due to increased hosting and server costs associated with our subscription and SaaS offerings, costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and royalty costs.•Operating expenses of $3.11 billion increased by $66.3 million, or 2%, during fiscal 2014, from $3.05 billion in fiscal 2013, and $306.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2013 from $2.74 billion in fiscal 2012. These increases were primarily due to increased costs associated with compensation and related benefits. •Net income of $268.4 million decreased by $21.6 million, or 7%, during fiscal 2014 from $290.0 million in fiscal 2013, and $542.8 million, or 65%, during fiscal 2013 from $832.8 million in fiscal 2012. •Net cash flow from operations of $1.29 billion during fiscal 2014 increased by $135.8 million, or 12%, from $1.15 billion during fiscal 2013 primarily due to cash inflows associated with the increases in deferred revenue and taxes payable, offset in part by lower net income. Net cash flow from operations during fiscal 2013 decreased by $347.9 million, or 23%, from $1.50 billion during fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower net income. 41Table of ContentsRevenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Product $1,627.8 $2,470.1 $3,342.8 (34)% (26)%Percentage of total revenue 39% 61% 76% Subscription 2,076.6 1,137.9 673.2 82 % 69 %Percentage of total revenue 50% 28% 15% Services and support 442.7 447.2 387.7 (1)% 15 %Percentage of total revenue 11% 11% 9% Total revenue $4,147.1 $4,055.2 $4,403.7 2 % (8)%Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including certain of our Adobe Marketing Cloud services and Creative Cloud.

The slight decrease was primarily driven by declines in revenue associated with distribution of third-party software downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. With respect to the Hobbyist product revenue decline, we are actively migrating customers to our Creative Cloud Photography Plan for which revenue is recognized ratably. Largely offsetting these decreases were increases in Creative Cloud and Document Services revenue.Revenue related to our creative professional products, which includes our Creative Cloud, Creative Suite editions and CS point products, increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to increases in revenue from subscriptions and ETLAs, partially offset by the decrease in revenue from CS point products and Creative Suite editions as we discontinued the general availability of our perpetually licensed CS6 products in the second quarter of 2014.Revenue associated with our other creative products decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases associated with distribution of third-party software downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. Additionally, actively migrating customers to our Creative Cloud Photography Plan is also contributing to the year-over-year decline in revenue. These decreases were offset in part by increases in revenue associated with our Digital Publishing Suite.For our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed decreased while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Unit average selling prices for our perpetual units licensed decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Document Services revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, increased during fiscal 2014 as compared with the year-ago period primarily due to increases in our Acrobat Cloud Services revenue. The increases were slightly offset by decreases due to our continued shift to ETLAs. Within Document Services, excluding large enterprise license agreements, the number of units licensed decreased while the unit average selling prices remained stable during fiscal 2014, as compared with the year-ago period.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $126.3 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 15% during fiscal 2014 as compared with the year-ago period. Contributing to this increase was Adobe Campaign and the strong adoption of AEM.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue and increased ETLAs for certain products in this group.Fiscal 2013 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2012 RevenueDigital MediaRevenue from Digital Media decreased $476.0 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to continued strong adoption of Creative Cloud and ETLAs as we continued to transition more of our business to a subscription-based model. 43Table of ContentsRevenue related to our creative professional products, which include our Creative Suite editions and CS point products as well as Creative Cloud, decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to continued customer adoption of Creative Cloud subscription offerings, released in May 2012, for which revenue is recognized over time. Revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increases associated with distribution of third-party software downloads and our Digital Publishing Suite. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Hobbyist products.For our creative offerings, the total number of perpetual units licensed decreased while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Unit average selling prices for our perpetual units licensed decreased during the year ended fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Document Services revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the continued shift to ETLAs offset by increased Acrobat Cloud Services revenue including revenue generated from our EchoSign e-signing service. Within Document Services, excluding large enterprise license agreements, the number of units licensed decreased while the unit average selling prices increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $143.8 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 26% during fiscal 2013, as compared to the year ago period and includes Adobe Campaign revenue from our acquisition of Neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. The increase noted above was partially offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our legacy products during fiscal 2013.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing decreased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased ETLAs for certain products in this group.

Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period due to increases in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. Revenue in EMEA increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to increases in Digital Marketing revenue. Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue in EMEA remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to the year-ago period. Despite the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound during the latter part of 2014, the overall weakening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in EMEA to increase as compared to the year-ago period. Within the Americas and EMEA, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Revenue in APAC decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period primarily as a result of decreases in Digital Media revenue due to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies during fiscal 2014 as compared to the year-ago period. Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained relatively stable in fiscal 2014 compared to the year-ago period. 44Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2012 Revenue by GeographyRevenue declined across all geographies during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Revenue in the Americas and APAC decreased during fiscal 2013 due to decreases in Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue, offset in part by increases in Digital Marketing revenue.

Within each geographical region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

This decrease was offset by the favorable impact to revenue measured in EMEA currencies as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro and the British Pound for the majority of fiscal 2014. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2014.During fiscal 2013, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease compared with the year-ago period. This decrease was partially offset by the favorable impact to revenue measured in EMEA currencies as the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against these currencies. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2013.See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.Product BacklogThe actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. We expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancellable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of November 28, 2014, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $1.7 billion of which approximately 60% to 65% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2015. As of November 29, 2013, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $1.0 billion. 45Table of ContentsWe expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.Cost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Product $97.1 $138.2 $121.7 (30)% 14%Percentage of total revenue 2% 3% 3% Subscription 335.5 278.1 219.1 21 % 27%Percentage of total revenue 8% 7% 5% Services and support 189.5 170.3 143.0 11 % 19%Percentage of total revenue 5% 4% 3% Total cost of revenue $622.1 $586.6 $483.8 6 % 21%ProductCost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.Fluctuations in cost of product revenue are due to the following: % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements (20)% 27 %Cost of sales(4) (8)Royalty cost(2) —Excess and obsolete inventory1 (4)Various individually insignificant items(5) (1)Total change(30)% 14 %Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, cost of sales and royalty costs, slightly offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements decreased as compared with the year-ago period as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements for which payments of $26.5 million related to historical use of certain technology licensing arrangements were expensed as cost of product revenue during fiscal 2013. Cost of sales decreased as compared with the year-ago period due to decreases in the number of perpetual units sold and associated packaging costs as we continue to focus our development and sales efforts on Creative Cloud. Royalty cost decreased as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to decreases in revenue from our perpetual offerings. Excess and obsolete inventory increased as compared to the year-ago period as a result of changes in reserve requirements for CS6 shrink boxes as we have discontinued the general availability of CS6 on a perpetual licensing basis.Cost of product revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements offset by decreases in cost of sales and excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements increased as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $51.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Of this cost, an estimated $25.3 million was related to future licensing rights and was capitalized and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from five to ten years. The remaining cost of approximately $26.5 million was related to historical use of licensing rights and was expensed as cost of product revenue in fiscal 2013. In connection with certain of these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Cost of sales primarily decreased due to a decline in the number of perpetual units sold and packaging costs associated with our CS6 products as we focus our creative development efforts on our Creative Cloud offering. Excess and obsolete inventory decreased due to decreased reserve requirements for CS6 as we continue to transition to more of a subscription-based model. 46Table of ContentsSubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third-parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items.

Data center costs increased as compared with the year-ago period primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Compensation cost and related benefits increased as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2014, including from our acquisition of Neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Depreciation expense increased as compared to the year-ago period primarily due to higher capital expenditures in recent periods as we continue to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our business. Royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings.Cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increased hosted server costs and amortization of purchased intangibles. Hosted server costs increased primarily due to increases in data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services, depreciation expense from higher capital expenditures in prior years and compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets purchased associated with our acquisitions of Behance and Neolane in fiscal 2013. Services and SupportCost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and third-party fees related to training and consulting services provided to our customers.Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to increases in third-party fees related to training and consulting services provided to our customers and compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount, including headcount from our acquisition of Neolane in fiscal 2013. 47Table of ContentsOperating Expenses (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Research and development $844.4 $826.6 $742.8 2 % 11%Percentage of total revenue 20% 20% 17% Sales and marketing 1,652.3 1,620.5 1,516.1 2 % 7%Percentage of total revenue 40% 40% 34% General and administrative 543.3 520.1 435.0 4 % 20%Percentage of total revenue 13% 13% 10% Restructuring and other charges 19.9 26.5 (2.9) (25)% *Percentage of total revenue —% 1% —% Amortization of purchased intangibles 52.4 52.3 48.7 — % 7%Percentage of total revenue 1% 1% 1% Total operating expenses $3,112.3 $3,046.0 $2,739.7 2 % 11%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is greater than 100%.Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 is primarily due to increases in cash incentive and stock-based compensation. The increase in stock-based compensation was driven by a change in the vesting term for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process beginning in fiscal 2013, which decreased the term from four years to three years. The increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 is primarily due to compensation and related benefits associated with additional headcount.The increase in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 is primarily due to higher cash incentive compensation program achievement in fiscal 2013, increases in stock-based compensation expense due to higher share prices during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as well as a shorter vesting term which decreased from four years to three years for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process during fiscal 2013.Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.Research and development expenses increased due to the following: % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Compensation associated with cash and stock-based incentives2% 7%Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount— 3Various individually insignificant items— 1Total change2% 11%We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool and service offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014 are lower than what was reported in our December 11, 2014 earnings press release by $19.5 million reflecting an update to our sales commission expense based on information received following the date of our press release. 48Table of ContentsSales and marketing expenses increased due to the following: % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount1% 4 %Compensation associated with cash and stock-based incentives— 4Various individually insignificant items1 (1)Total change2% 7 %General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel.

Restructuring and Other ChargesDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. During fiscal 2014, in connection with our recent Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan, we recorded $19.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. In connection with our Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded insignificant charges associated with closing redundant facilities. We also recorded minor adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2013, management approved a plan to sell land, building and other assets located in Waltham, Massachusetts (the ""Waltham property assets"") with a total carrying amount of $47.4 million. As of May 31, 2013, we classified the Waltham property assets as held for sale at $23.6 million representing their fair value, net of estimated costs to sell which was the lesser of the fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount of the assets. As a result, we recorded a write-down of $23.8 million during fiscal 2013. In September 2013, we finalized the sale of the Waltham property assets for net proceeds of $24.3 million which approximated the carrying value of the assets at the time of sale.Also during fiscal 2013, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $6.3 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. We also recorded $3.0 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year. During fiscal 2012, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded $17.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. We also recorded $20.3 million in net favorable employee termination and facility related adjustments for changes in previous estimates during the fiscal year. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans. 49Table of ContentsAmortization of Purchased IntangiblesDuring the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years. Amortization expense remained stable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013.Amortization expense increased 7% during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Behance and Neolane in fiscal 2013.Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Interest and other income (expense), net $7.3 $4.9 $(3.4) 49 % *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Interest expense (59.7) (67.5) (67.5) (12)% —%Percentage of total revenue (1)% (2)% (2)% Investment gains (losses), net 1.1 (4.0) 9.5 * *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Total non-operating income (expense), net $(51.3) $(66.6) $(61.4) (23)% 8%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.(**) Percentage is less than 1%.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from hedging Euros, British Pounds and Yen currencies.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses and increased realized gains on fixed income investments. The increases were partially offset by decreased interest income on our investment in lease receivable due to the purchase of the East and West Towers during fiscal 2014. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to decreased foreign exchange losses.Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. See Notes 5 and 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps. Interest expense remained relatively stable during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. 50Table of ContentsInvestment gains (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Net gains related to our trading securities $1.9 $3.0 $1.6Net losses related to our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies (0.8) — (0.2)Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable and non-marketable equity securities — (7.0) (0.1)Gains from sale of marketable equity securities — — 8.2Total investment gains (losses), net $1.1 $(4.0) $9.5 During fiscal 2014, total investment gains (losses), net increased to net gains primarily due to write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2013 that did not recur in fiscal 2014, offset in part by a decrease in net gains related to our trading securities.During fiscal 2013, total investment gains (losses), net decreased to net losses primarily due to a decrease in net realized gains from the sale of marketable equity securities and an increase in write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies.Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 % Change2014-2013 % Change2013-2012Provision $93.0 $66.2 $286.0 40% (77)%Percentage of total revenue 2% 2% 6% Effective tax rate 26% 19% 26% Our effective tax rate increased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2013 and stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2014.Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease is primarily related to the reinstatement of the U.S. research and development credit and tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations. In December 2014, the United States Congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit through December 31, 2014. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the U.S., we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2014 was $148.8 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2014 were recognized in the future, $136.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $12.6 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns.As of November 28, 2014, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $14.6 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of 51Table of Contentscurrent and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million.In July 2013, a U.S. income tax examination covering fiscal 2008 and 2009 was completed. Our accrued tax and interest related to these years was $48.4 million and was previously reported in long-term income taxes payable. We settled the tax obligation resulting from this examination with cash and income tax assets totaling $41.2 million, and the resulting $7.2 million income tax benefit was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)November 28, 2014 November 29, 2013Cash and cash equivalents$1,117.4 $834.6Short-term investments$2,622.1 $2,339.2Working capital$2,107.9 $2,520.3Stockholders’ equity$6,775.9 $6,724.6A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$1,287.5 $1,151.7 $1,499.6Net cash used for investing activities(490.7) (1,177.8) (834.7)Net cash used for financing activities(507.3) (559.1) (234.7)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(6.7) (5.2) 5.4Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$282.8 $(590.4) $435.6 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our Creative Cloud offering and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission accruals associated with higher achievement levels. Trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in taxes payable is largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to 52Table of Contentsincreases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of R&D and foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2012, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.5 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to an increase in activity for both upgrade plans with support and site and term licenses largely associated with our Digital Media and Digital Marketing enterprise license agreements. The decrease in trade receivables is primarily related to an increase in revenue linearity and improved collections in our Digital Marketing portfolio offset in part by higher revenue levels due to the CS6 product release which occurred late in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued restructuring and trade payables. Decreases in accrued restructuring primarily related to payments and adjustments for employee terminations and facility exit costs associated with the Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan, a significant portion of which were paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012. Trade payables decreased primarily due to the timing of payments as a greater number of invoices were paid prior to the fiscal year end in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.For fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1,177.8 million was primarily due to our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment associated with our construction projects in Oregon and India and purchases of long-term technology licenses. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of the Waltham Property. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance. For fiscal 2012, net cash used for investing activities of $834.7 million was primarily due to our acquisition of Efficient Frontier in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2012 represented purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of Efficient Frontier. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million, $559.1 million and $234.7 million, respectively, was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. In December 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we expect to acquire Fotolia for approximately $800 million in cash. We expect to finance the acquisition using existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, newly issued debt or drawings from our existing revolving credit agreement. We believe that these resources, in addition to cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the acquisition. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of Fotolia. RestructuringDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. Currently, the Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan is the only plan of significance to us as we consider our restructuring plans initiated in prior years to be substantially complete.As of November 28, 2014, we have accrued total restructuring charges of $22.3 million of which approximately $15.0 million relates to ongoing termination benefits that are expected to be paid during fiscal 2015. The remaining $7.3 million relates to the cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 of which approximately 45% will be paid through 2016. During fiscal 2014, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $11.0 million 53Table of Contentswhich consisted of $5.7 million and $5.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.As of November 29, 2013, we accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million of which approximately $11.7 million related to cost of closing redundant facilities. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $2.2 million related to the cost of termination benefits and contract terminations. During fiscal 2013, we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling $10.3 million which consisted of $1.3 million and $9.0 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.As of November 30, 2012, we accrued total restructuring charges of $21.6 million of which $2.3 million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $19.3 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2012, we made payments related to restructuring plans totaling $63.1 million which consisted of $50.5 million and $12.6 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2015 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $3.7 billion as of November 28, 2014. Of this amount, approximately 80% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. As of November 28, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1.0 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 28, 2014, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.5 billion, consisting of $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we reclassified $599.8 million as current debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represented the 2015 Notes, net of unamortized original issuance discount. We intend to refinance the current portion of our debt on or before the due date using either newly issued debt or drawings from our existing revolving credit agreement. In anticipation of this refinancing, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a large financial institution subsequent to November 28, 2014, which fixed a benchmark U.S. Treasury rate for an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million. This derivative agreement hedges the impact on future interest payments attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate and will be terminated upon the debt issuance.We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 82% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2014. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities. 54Table of ContentsStock Repurchase ProgramWe are currently repurchasing common stock under our $2.0 billion authority granted by our Board of Directors in April 2012.Subsequent to November 28, 2014, as part of our $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200.0 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200.0 million stock repurchase agreement, there is no remaining balance under our current authority.Subsequent to November 28, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the company authority to repurchase up to $2.0 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous $2.0 billion stock repurchase program. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we entered into structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $600.0 million, $1.1 billion and $405.0 million, respectively. The $600.0 million and $1.1 billion prepayments during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, were under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase authority. Of the $405.0 million of prepayments during fiscal 2012, $100.0 million were under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $305.0 million were under our previous $1.6 billion stock repurchase authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 11.5 million shares at an average price per share of $32.29 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 28, 2014, November 29, 2013 and November 30, 2012 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 28, 2014, $40.3 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 28, 2014.Summary of Stock Repurchases for Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except average amounts)Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2014 2013 2012 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageJune 2010 Structured repurchases(1) — $— — $— 9,482 $32.17April 2012 Structured repurchases(1) 10,852 $63.48 21,603 $46.47 2,038 $32.87Total shares 10,852 $63.48 21,603 $46.47 11,520 $32.29Total cost $688,902 $1,003,794 $371,995_________________________________________ (1) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See Stock Repurchase Program above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 28, 2014 consist of obligations under operating leases, capital leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments. 55Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 28, 2014 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsNotes $1,744.9 $652.5 $85.5 $85.5 $921.4Operating lease obligations 202.6 42.6 67.4 46.8 45.8Capital lease obligations 3.3 3.3 — — —Purchase obligations 288.9 227.9 42.2 18.8 —Total $2,239.7 $926.3 $195.1 $151.1 $967.2Senior NotesIn February 2010, we issued $600.0 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 and $900.0 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 28, 2014, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the senior notes was $244.9 million for the remaining duration of our senior notes. In June of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.Capital Lease ObligationIn January 2013, we entered into a sale-leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling $25.7 million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of 24 months. This transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and was recorded at fair value.CovenantsOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of November 28, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2014 was $148.8 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million. RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not 56Table of Contentsbeen significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the U.S., we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue denominated in Euro, British Pounds and Yen. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our revenue exposures for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows (in millions, except Yen): Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Euro€455.5 €434.7 €530.7Yen (in billions)¥28 ¥32.5 ¥34.8British Pounds£159.1 £145.3 £145.1As of November 28, 2014, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $672.9 million which included the notional equivalent of $359.5 million in Euros, $104.7 million in British Pounds, $159.5 million in Yen and $49.2 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 28, 2014, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2015. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 28, 2014. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $40.9 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $28.9 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 28, 2014 and November 29, 2013, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $161.7 million and $355.6 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis. 57Table of ContentsEconomic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted TransactionsWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 28, 2014, net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur were insignificant.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 28, 2014, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 28, 2014, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $2.6 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):Due within one year$607.2Due within two years904.9Due within three years834.2Due after three years275.3Total$2,621.6A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 28, 2014. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 28, 2014 and November 29, 2013 (dollars in millions):-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/28/14 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS2,663.3 2,656.3 2,641.9 2,621.6 2,599.8 2,578.0 2,556.2-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/29/13 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS2,363.7 2,360.9 2,353.8 2,338.5 2,320.5 2,302.5 2,284.5Senior NotesAs of November 28, 2014, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.5 billion, consisting of $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 58Table of Contents“2020 Notes” and, together with the 2015 Notes, the “Notes”). In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of November 28, 2014, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.5 billion and the related fair value based on inactive market prices was $1.6 billion.Other Market RiskPrivately Held Long-Term InvestmentsThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.Marketable Equity SecuritiesWe have minimal exposure to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 28, 2014 and November 29, 2013, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were insignificant. 59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:12.182946
796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology for $616.7 million, and privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work for $111.1 million. During fiscal 2013, we integrated Neolane and Behance into our Digital Marketing and Digital Media reportable segments, respectively. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, perpetual and time-based software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. 35Table of ContentsWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition 36Table of Contentsdate. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and•discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill ImpairmentWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and determined there was no impairment. The results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic 37Table of Contentstax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.Recent Accounting Pronouncements On November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities’ processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.With the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2015For fiscal 2015, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Adobe Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud, first delivered in May 2012, is our next-generation offering that supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. Creative Cloud delivers value through more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire Creative Cloud capabilities through Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”). The three Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers, most notably with our acquisition of Fotolia in January of 2015, to enable the delivery and purchase of stock assets in our new service called Adobe Stock. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and shift our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offering. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and ETLAs, perpetual revenue for older Creative products has continued to decline, and revenue from perpetual licensing of these products was immaterial for fiscal 2015.We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Reader DC and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe eSign. Adobe Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered the next generation of this offering called Adobe Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices. Adobe Document Cloud includes all-new Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe eSign releases and a set of integrated services enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is licensed both through subscription and perpetual pricing.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently our key performance metric to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We plan to adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value + Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARR 39Table of ContentsTotal Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2015 was $2.60 billion, up from $1.61 billion at the end of fiscal 2014. We exited fiscal 2015 with 6.167 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up 78% from 3.458 million at the end of fiscal 2014. Our Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud products and solutions, including our newly released Acrobat DC product which helped grow Document Cloud ARR to $397 million exiting fiscal 2015, up from $265 million at the end of fiscal 2014.Total Digital Media ARR grew to approximately $3.00 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, up from $1.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue model. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2015 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2015 and held constant throughout the year. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2015 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2016, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2015 would be $2.88 billion or approximately $114 million lower than the ARR reported above.We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud now includes eight solutions which address the expanding needs of marketers. In fiscal 2015, we achieved record Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion, which represents 16% year-over-year revenue growth. In addition, we drove strong demand and bookings growth for our Marketing Cloud solutions, which we expect will positively benefit revenue growth in future quarters.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2015•During fiscal 2015, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 67% from 50% compared with fiscal 2014, as we transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $3.00 billion as of November 27, 2015 increased by $1.12 billion, or 60%, from $1.88 billion as of November 28, 2014. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions and continued adoption of our ETLAs, and to a lesser extent, the adoption of our Document Cloud offering through our ETLAs and increases in Document Cloud subscriptions. •Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion increased by $188.5 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2015, from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2014. The increases were primarily due to continued adoption of our Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”) offering and increases in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics revenue.•Our total deferred revenue of $1.49 billion as of November 27, 2015 increased by $330.0 million, or 29%, from $1.16 billion as of November 28, 2014, primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, ETLAs and new contracts and existing renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. Also contributing to the increase in deferred revenue were the increases associated with our stock photography offering from the acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.•Cost of revenue of $744.3 million increased by $122.2 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2015, from $622.1 million in fiscal 2014. The increases were primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and costs of professional services driven by the increase in our professional services business.•Operating expenses of $3.15 billion increased by $35.8 million during fiscal 2015, from $3.11 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase is due to higher costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and amortization of intangibles from the Fotolia acquisition in fiscal 2015. •Net income of $629.6 million increased by $361.2 million, or 135%, during fiscal 2015 from $268.4 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to revenue growth. •Net cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion during fiscal 2015 increased by $182.0 million, or 14%, from $1.29 billion during fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher net income. 40Table of ContentsRevenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Subscription $3,223.9 $2,076.6 $1,137.9 55 % 82 %Percentage of total revenue 67% 50% 28% Product 1,125.1 1,627.8 2,470.1 (31)% (34)%Percentage of total revenue 24% 39% 61% Services and support 446.5 442.7 447.2 1 % (1)%Percentage of total revenue 9% 11% 11% Total revenue $4,795.5 $4,147.1 $4,055.2 16 % 2 %Our subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud services. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of the service. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and subscription models.We have the following reportable segments—Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing.

Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.Segments In fiscal 2015, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:•Digital Media—Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. •Digital Marketing—Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officers and chief revenue officers.•Print and Publishing—Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse authoring and publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. 41Table of ContentsSegment Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Digital Media $3,095.2 $2,603.2 $2,625.9 19% (1)%Percentage of total revenue 65% 63% 65% Digital Marketing 1,508.9 1,355.2 1,228.8 11% 10 %Percentage of total revenue 31% 33% 30% Print and Publishing 191.4 188.7 200.5 1% (6)%Percentage of total revenue 4% 4% 5% Total revenue $4,795.5 $4,147.1 $4,055.2 16% 2 %Fiscal 2015 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2014 RevenueDigital MediaRevenue from Digital Media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to continued strong adoption of Creative Cloud. Document Cloud revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by the increase in number of paid Creative Cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. The increases associated with our creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with eSign and our Document Cloud subscription offering were offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud perpetual license offerings. Driving the increase in our Document Cloud subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and ETLAs.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 16% as compared with the year-ago period. Contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our AEM term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with Adobe Campaign, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target. Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.Fiscal 2014 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2013 RevenueDigital MediaRevenue from Digital Media decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The slight decrease was primarily driven by declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings, distribution of third-party software downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. With respect to the Hobbyist product revenue decline, we began actively migrating customers to our Creative Cloud Photography Plan in fiscal 2014, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Largely offsetting these decreases were increases in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud revenue.Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud, Creative Suite editions and CS point products, decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to decreases in revenue from CS point products and Creative Suite editions, as we discontinued the general availability of our perpetually licensed CS6 products in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Also contributing to the decline in creative revenue were decreases in revenue associated with the distribution of third-party software downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. Decreases were largely offset by increases in revenue from subscriptions and ETLAs and revenue from our Digital Publishing Suite. Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in our Document Cloud subscription revenue. Increases were slightly offset by decreases due to our continued shift to ETLAs. 42Table of ContentsDigital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $126.3 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 15% during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Contributing to this increase was Adobe Campaign and the strong adoption of AEM.Print and PublishingRevenue from Print and Publishing decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue and increased ETLAs for certain products in this group.Geographical Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Americas $2,788.1 $2,314.4 $2,134.4 20% 8 %Percentage of total revenue 58% 56% 53% EMEA 1,336.4 1,179.9 1,129.2 13% 4 %Percentage of total revenue 28% 28% 28% APAC 671.0 652.8 791.6 3% (18)%Percentage of total revenue 14% 16% 19% Total revenue $4,795.5 $4,147.1 $4,055.2 16% 2 %Fiscal 2015 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2014 Revenue by GeographyRevenue increased in the Americas and EMEA during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 while revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 compared with the year-ago period. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased primarily due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. The overall increase in EMEA revenue was slightly offset by declines due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA currencies in fiscal 2015. Within the Americas and EMEA, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.Revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue.The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. The decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2013 Revenue by GeographyOverall revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Revenue in the Americas increased due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. Revenue in EMEA increased primarily due to growth in Digital Marketing revenue. Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue in EMEA remained relatively stable. Despite strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound during the latter part of fiscal 2014, the overall weakening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in EMEA to increase as compared to fiscal 2013. Within the Americas and EMEA, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Revenue in APAC decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of decreases in Digital Media revenue due to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies. Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. 43Table of ContentsIncluded in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

These decreases were partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA currencies and Japanese Yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease compared to fiscal 2013. This decrease was offset in part by the favorable impact to revenue measured in EMEA currencies as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro and the British Pound for the majority of fiscal 2014. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2014.See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.Product BacklogThe actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. We expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of November 27, 2015, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.89 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2016. As of November 28, 2014, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.19 billion, which has been updated to include $433 million of individual annual subscriptions which were not captured in the prior year due to current year enhancements to our management reporting system. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments. 44Table of ContentsCost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Subscription $409.2 $335.5 $278.1 22 % 21 %Percentage of total revenue 9% 8% 7% Product 90.0 97.1 138.2 (7)% (30)%Percentage of total revenue 2% 2% 3% Services and support 245.1 189.5 170.3 29 % 11 %Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 4% Total cost of revenue $744.3 $622.1 $586.6 20 % 6 %SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.

Data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures in recent periods as we continue to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business. Royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings and increased royalties due to the introduction of our stock photography offering from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. Cost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to data center costs, compensation and related benefits, depreciation expense, and royalty cost. Data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Compensation cost and related benefits increased primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2014, including from our acquisition of Neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures as we continued to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our business. Royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings.ProductCost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. 45Table of ContentsFluctuations in cost of product revenue are due to the following: % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Cost of sales(3)% (4)%Excess and obsolete inventory(4) 1Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements (2) (20)Royalty cost3 (2)Various individually insignificant items(1) (5)Total change(7)% (30)%Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and obsolete inventory, cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. The increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, cost of sales and royalty cost, slightly offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements decreased as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements for which payments of $26.5 million related to historical use of certain technology licensing arrangements were expensed as cost of product revenue during fiscal 2013. Cost of sales decreased due to decreases in the number of perpetual units sold and associated packaging costs as we continued to focus our development and sales efforts on Creative Cloud. Royalty cost decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from our perpetual offerings. Excess and obsolete inventory increased as a result of changes in reserve requirements for CS6 shrink boxes as we discontinued the general availability of CS6 on a perpetual licensing basis.Services and SupportCost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.Cost of services and support revenue increased in all periods presented due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and third-party fees to support the increase in our professional services business.

General and administrative expenses decreased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the reversal of a previously anticipated loss associated with the HTEAL proceedings, offset in part by increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount. The increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases in cash incentive and stock-based compensation. The increase in stock-based compensation was driven by a change in the vesting term for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process beginning in fiscal 2013, which decreased the term from four years to three years. The increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to compensation and related benefits associated with additional headcount.Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.Research and development expenses increased due to the following: % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount2 % —%Compensation associated with cash and stock-based incentives(1) 2Various individually insignificant items1 —Total change2 % 2%We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products, subscription and solution offerings.

See Note 15 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the HTEAL proceedings.Restructuring and Other ChargesDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans consisting of reductions in workforce and the consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. As of November 27, 2015, we considered all our restructuring plans to be substantially complete. We continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans, however the current impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is not material.During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial credits and charges to our restructuring plans. During fiscal 2014, in connection with our Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan, we recorded $19.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. In connection with our Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded insignificant charges associated with closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2013, we sold land, building and other assets located in Waltham, Massachusetts for net proceeds of $24.3 million. Because the total carrying amount of these assets was $47.4 million at the time it was classified as held for sale, we recorded a write-down of $23.1 million during fiscal 2013. Also during fiscal 2013, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded immaterial charges and credits associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities during the fiscal year. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.Amortization of Purchased IntangiblesDuring the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years. Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier and Day Software Holding AG that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.Amortization expense remained stable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. 48Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Interest and other income (expense), net $33.9 $7.3 $4.9 * 49 %Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Interest expense (64.2) (59.7) (67.5) 8 % (12)%Percentage of total revenue (1)% (1)% (2)% Investment gains (losses), net 1.0 1.1 (4.0) * *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Total non-operating income (expense), net $(29.3) $(51.3) $(66.6) (43)% (23)%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.(**) Percentage is less than 1%.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses and increased realized gains on fixed income investments. The increases were partially offset by decreased interest income on our investment in lease receivable due to the purchase of the East and West Towers of our corporate headquarter offices during fiscal 2014. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables.Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.Interest expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. See Notes 5 and 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps. Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. During fiscal 2015, total investment gains (losses), net remained stable compared to fiscal 2014.During fiscal 2014, total investment gains (losses), net increased to net gains primarily due to write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2013 that did not recur in fiscal 2014, offset in part by a decrease in net gains related to our trading securities. 49Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 % Change2015-2014 % Change2014-2013Provision $244.2 $93.0 $66.2 163% 40%Percentage of total revenue 5% 2% 2% Effective tax rate 28% 26% 19% Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’s trading companies. The increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2014. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014. Our effective tax rate increased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2013 and stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2014.In December 2015, the United States Congress passed the permanent extension of the federal research and development tax credit. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will include a discrete tax benefit for the 2015 credit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effective annual tax rate.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015 was $258.7 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015 were recognized in the future, $220.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $38.5 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.As of November 27, 2015, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $27.8 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million. 50Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)November 27, 2015 November 28, 2014Cash and cash equivalents$876.6 $1,117.4Short-term investments$3,111.5 $2,622.1Working capital$2,608.3 $2,107.9Stockholders’ equity$7,001.6 $6,775.9 A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$1,469.5 $1,287.5 $1,151.7Net cash used for investing activities(1,488.4) (490.7) (1,177.8)Net cash used for financing activities(200.7) (507.3) (559.1)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(21.2) (6.7) (5.2)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(240.8) $282.8 $(590.4) Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in income taxes payable is primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels. For fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.15 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our Creative Cloud offering and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which were discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission accruals associated with higher achievement levels. Trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2013 were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in taxes payable was largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of federal research and development and foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. 51Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of Fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively.For fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.For fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment associated with our construction projects in Oregon and India and purchases of long-term technology licenses. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesIn January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million in connection with our 2025 Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method.We used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 include payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For fiscal 2014 and 2013, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million and $559.1 million, respectively, was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. RestructuringDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. We consider our restructuring plans to be substantially complete.As of November 27, 2015, we have accrued total restructuring charges of $4.7 million, substantially all of which relate to the cost of closing redundant facilities and is expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 for which approximately 75% will be paid through fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2015, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $18.2 million which consisted of $16.6 million in payments associated with termination benefits and contract terminations and the remaining payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.As of November 28, 2014, we had accrued total restructuring charges of $22.3 million of which approximately $15.0 million related to termination benefits and contract terminations. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $7.3 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2014, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $11.0 52Table of Contentsmillion which consisted of $5.7 million and $5.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.As of November 29, 2013, we had accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million of which approximately $11.7 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $2.2 million related to the cost of termination benefits and contract terminations. During fiscal 2013, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $10.3 million which primarily consisted of $9.0 million in payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2016 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $3.99 billion as of November 27, 2015. Of this amount, approximately 85% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of November 27, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 27, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 57% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2015. Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the Company authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $625 million, $600 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Of the $625 million in prepayments made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the new $2 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $200 million were under the previous $2 billion authority. The $600 million and $1.1 billion in prepayments made during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were under the previous $2 billion stock repurchase authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions 53Table of Contentsor fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price per share of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2015, November 28, 2014 and November 29, 2013 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2015, $38.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.Subsequent to November 27, 2015, as part of our $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $150 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $150 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.43 billion remains under our current authority.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 27, 2015.Summary of Stock Repurchases for Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except average amounts)Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2015 2014 2013 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageApril 2012 Structured repurchases(1) 3,255 $73.83 10,852 $63.48 21,603 $46.47January 2015 Structured repurchases(1) 4,849 $79.76 — $— — $—Total shares 8,104 $77.38 10,852 $63.48 21,603 $46.47Total cost $627,082 $688,902 $1,003,794_________________________________________ (1) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions.

As of November 27, 2015, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying value of $1.91 billion. At November 27, 2015, our 54Table of Contentsmaximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $501.1 million for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.CovenantsOur credit facility and Almaden Tower lease contain a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015 was $258.7 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million. RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 55Table of ContentsOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in millions, except Yen): Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013Euro€589.6 €455.5 €434.7Yen (in billions)¥29.7 ¥28 ¥32.5British Pounds£192.0 £159.1 £145.3As of November 27, 2015, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $661.0 million which included the notional equivalent of $318.5 million in Euros, $144.4 million in British Pounds, $118.7 million in Yen and $79.4 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 27, 2015, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2016. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses which would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 27, 2015. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $39.0 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $18.4 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $61.9 million and $161.7 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 27, 2015, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because 56Table of Contentsgains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 27, 2015, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 27, 2015, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.1 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):Due within one year$853.0Due within two years1,202.6Due within three years771.3Due after three years284.6Total$3,111.5A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 27, 2015. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 (dollars in millions):-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/27/15 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$3,172.3 $3,156.6 $3,135.2 $3,111.5 $3,087.7 $3,063.9 $3,040.1-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/28/14 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$2,663.3 $2,656.3 $2,641.9 $2,621.6 $2,599.8 $2,578.0 $2,556.2Senior NotesAs of November 27, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of November 27, 2015, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.91 billion and the related fair value based on inactive market prices was $1.97 billion.Other Market RiskPrivately Held Long-Term InvestmentsThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014. 57Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:10.612946
796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.Subsequent to December 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and the issuance of these financial statements. TubeMogul will be integrated into our Digital Marketing reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer’s life cycle.We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, 37Table of Contentsrevenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. 38Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio; and•discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill ImpairmentWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. As part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not that the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. This qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy and changes in customers.If the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we exercise judgment at various steps, including the identification of reporting segments, assignment of goodwill to reporting segments, and determination of the fair value of each reporting segment. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. 39Table of ContentsWe completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and determined there was no impairment. The results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2016For fiscal 2016, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions. In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Adobe Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community- 40Table of Contentsbased features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. These Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products is now immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Adobe Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Adobe Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enables users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2016 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2016 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows: Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value + Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARRCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2016 was $3.54 billion, up from $2.50 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2016 was $475 million, up from $385 million at the end of fiscal 2015. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $4.01 billion at the end of fiscal 2016, up from $2.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2016 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2017, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2016 would be $3.99 billion or approximately $27 million lower than the ARR reported above.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2016 was $3.18 billion, up from $2.30 billion in fiscal 2015 and representing 38% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2016 was $764.9 million, slightly down from $792.3 million in fiscal 2015 as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016, up from $3.10 billion in fiscal 2015 and representing 27% year-over-year growth. 41Table of ContentsWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Digital Marketing business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. We deliver these capabilities through our Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance.

Customers also include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct salesforce to market and license our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners including marketing agencies, systems integrators and developers that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. In fiscal 2016, we achieved record Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year revenue growth. In December 2016, we acquired TubeMogul and we will integrate TubeMogul in our Digital Marketing business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect that the addition of TubeMogul and sustained demand across our portfolio of Marketing Cloud solutions will drive revenue growth in future years.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2016•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $4.01 billion as of December 2, 2016 increased by $1.13 billion, or 39%, from $2.88 billion as of November 27, 2015. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscriptions, and continued adoption of our ETLAs. •Creative revenue of $3.18 billion increased by $873.2 million, or 38%, during fiscal 2016, from $2.30 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering.•Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion increased by $272.7 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2016, from $1.36 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to continued adoption of our Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”) offering and increases in Adobe Analytics and Adobe Campaign revenue.•Our total deferred revenue of $2.01 billion as of December 2, 2016 increased by $529.5 million, or 36%, from $1.49 billion as of November 27, 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, ETLAs and new contracts and renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. •Cost of revenue of $819.9 million increased by $75.6 million, or 10%, during fiscal 2016, from $744.3 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and increases in data center costs.•Operating expenses of $3.54 billion increased by $392.8 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2016, from $3.15 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount. •Net income of $1.17 billion increased by $539.2 million, or 86%, during fiscal 2016 from $629.6 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to subscription revenue growth. •Net cash flow from operations of $2.20 billion during fiscal 2016 increased by $730.2 million, or 50%, from $1.47 billion during fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher net income and the increase in deferred revenue. 42Table of ContentsRevenue (dollars in millions)Revenue for fiscal 2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2015 and 2014, which were 52-week years.

Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetual creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, and continued adoption of our ETLAs. To a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative offerings. Increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offering. Decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate more customers to our Document Cloud, along with increases in Adobe Sign revenue.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 20% year over year. Increases in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our AEM offerings and, to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Campaign. Fiscal 2015 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2014 RevenueDigital MediaRevenue from Digital Media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to the strong adoption of Creative Cloud. Document Cloud revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by the increase in the number of paid Creative Cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. Increases associated with our creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with Adobe Sign and our Document Cloud subscription offerings were offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offerings. Driving the increase in our Document Cloud subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and ETLAs. 44Table of ContentsDigital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 16% as compared to fiscal 2014.

See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.BacklogDeferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription, SAAS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of December 2, 2016, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.4 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017. Comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.9 billion as of November 27, 2015, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2016. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments. 46Table of ContentsCost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change2016-2015 % Change2015-2014Subscription $461.9 $409.2 $335.5 13 % 22 %Percentage of total revenue 8% 9% 8% Product 68.9 90.0 97.1 (23)% (7)%Percentage of total revenue 1% 2% 2% Services and support 289.1 245.1 189.5 18 % 29 %Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 5% Total cost of revenue $819.9 $744.3 $622.1 10 % 20 %SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.

Data center costs increased during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures as we invested in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business.

As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier and Day Software Holding AG that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014. 50Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change2016-2015 % Change2015-2014Interest and other income (expense), net $13.5 $33.9 $7.3 (60)% *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Interest expense (70.4) (64.2) (59.7) 10 % 8 %Percentage of total revenue (1)% (1)% (1)% Investment gains (losses), net (1.6) 1.0 1.1 * *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Total non-operating income (expense), net $(58.5) $(29.3) $(51.3) 100 % (43)%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.(**) Percentage is less than 1%.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and the increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset by the increase in interest income due to increased average investment balance and interest rates. Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps. Interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in floating rate on interest rate swap and higher average debt balances.Interest expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies. 51Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014 % Change2016-2015 % Change2015-2014Provision $266.4 $244.2 $93.0 9% 163%Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 2% Effective tax rate 19% 28% 26% Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the U.S. Research and Development credit for 2015 and onward. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2015. A tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. In addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’s trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development credit in December 2014.Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’s trading companies. The increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2014. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014. We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016 were recognized in the future, $144.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $33.9 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.As of December 2, 2016, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $22.4 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.During fiscal 2016, a number of income tax examinations covering our fiscal years 2010 to 2016 were completed. Of the significant examinations, accrued tax and interest related to these years were $95.6 million and were previously reported in non-current income taxes payable. We settled the tax obligation resulting from these examinations with cash and income tax assets totaling $35.3 million, and the resulting $60.3 million income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal 2016. 52Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)December 2, 2016 November 27, 2015Cash and cash equivalents$1,011.3 $876.6Short-term investments$3,750.0 $3,111.5Working capital$3,028.1 $2,608.3Stockholders’ equity$7,424.8 $7,001.6 A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$2,199.7 $1,469.5 $1,287.5Net cash used for investing activities(960.0) (1,488.4) (490.7)Net cash used for financing activities(1,090.7) (200.7) (507.3)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(14.2) (21.2) (6.7)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$134.8 $(240.8) $282.8 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee options. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. For fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels. For fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. 53Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. For fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of Fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively.For fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.We used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 also include payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For fiscal 2014, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2017 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $4.76 billion as of December 2, 2016. Of this amount, approximately 83% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds. 54Table of ContentsCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 2, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of December 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). Subsequent to December 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 61% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2016. Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion, $625 million and $600 million, respectively. The prepayments of $1.08 billion made during fiscal 2016 were under the current $2 billion authority. Of the prepayments of $625 million made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the current $2 billion authority and $200 million were under the previous $2 billion authority. The prepayments of $600 million made during fiscal 2014 were under the previous $2 billion authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price per share of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2016, November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2016, $100.1 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to December 2, 2016, as part of our current $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200 million stock repurchase agreement, $300 million remains under our current authority. 55Table of ContentsSubsequent to December 2, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2016.Summary of Stock Repurchases for Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except average amounts)Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2016 2015 2014 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageApril 2012 Structured repurchases(1) — $— 3,255 $73.83 10,852 $63.48January 2015 Structured repurchases(1) 10,428 $97.16 4,849 $79.76 — $—Total shares 10,428 $97.16 8,104 $77.38 10,852 $63.48Total cost $1,013,131 $627,082 $688,902_________________________________________ (1) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See Stock Repurchase Program above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 2, 2016 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 2, 2016 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsNotes $2,326.0 $75.3 $1,104.4 $65.0 $1,081.3Operating lease obligations 370.5 43.5 79.5 70.0 177.5Purchase obligations 301.0 275.1 23.3 2.6 —Total $2,997.5 $393.9 $1,207.2 $137.6 $1,258.8Senior NotesAs of December 2, 2016, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying value of $1.90 billion. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At December 2, 2016, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $425.9 million for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.CovenantsOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreement that are reported to the lessor quarterly. As of December 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 56Table of ContentsAccounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million. RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions, except Yen): Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014Euro€825.6 €589.6 €455.5Yen (in billions)¥38.7 ¥29.7 ¥28.0British Pounds£263.5 £192.0 £159.1 57Table of ContentsAs of December 2, 2016, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $891.2 million which included the notional equivalent of $476.6 million in Euros, $152.4 million in British Pounds, $181.2 million in Yen and $81.0 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 2, 2016, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2017. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses which would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2016. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $56.6 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $37.9 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $70.2 million and $61.9 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2016, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 2, 2016, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. 58Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt December 2, 2016, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.75 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):Due within one year$1,230.4Due between one and two years1,322.9Due between two and three years782.9Due after three years413.8Total$3,750.0A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 2, 2016. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 (dollars in millions):-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/2/16 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$3,828.5 $3,805.9 $3,778.4 $3,750.0 $3,721.6 $3,693.2 $3,664.8-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/27/15 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$3,172.3 $3,156.6 $3,135.2 $3,111.5 $3,087.7 $3,063.9 $3,040.1Senior NotesAs of December 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.90 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 2, 2016, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.90 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $1.97 billion.Other Market RiskPrivately Held Long-Term InvestmentsThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015. 59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:10.958216

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for $560.8 million. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. During fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer’s life cycle.We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; we have delivered the product or performed the service; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. We enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.For our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire 35Table of Contentsarrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.We determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.We have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.For multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.For multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.We are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.In the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.We recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. 36Table of ContentsAccounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. 37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2017For fiscal 2017, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions. In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users’ machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of Creative Cloud’s low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2017 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2017 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value + Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARR 38Table of ContentsCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2017 was $4.63 billion, up from $3.52 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2017 was $600 million, up from $472 million at the end of fiscal 2016. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $5.23 billion at the end of fiscal 2017, up from $3.99 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2017 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2018, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2017 would be $5.39 billion or approximately $154 million higher than the ARR reported above.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2017 was $4.17 billion, up from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2017 was $836.7 million, up from $764.9 million in fiscal 2016 and representing 9% year-over-year revenue growth as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $5.01 billion in fiscal 2017, up from $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 27% year-over-year growth. We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Digital Marketing business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. In March 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under what was formerly known as Adobe Marketing Cloud to our next generation offering referred to as Adobe Experience Cloud. Adobe Experience Cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:•Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Adobe Social and Adobe Primetime.•Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager. •Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines capabilities from Adobe Media Optimizer (“AMO”) and Adobe’s acquisition of TubeMogul during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.In addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2017•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $5.23 billion as of December 1, 2017 increased by $1.24 billion, or 31%, from $3.99 billion as of December 2, 2016.

Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in individual, team and enterprise subscriptions. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering.Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in Document Cloud subscriptions revenue, offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetually licensed Acrobat offering. Also contributing to the increase in Document Cloud revenue was an increase in Adobe Sign revenue.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $383.4 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by strong performance with our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings, which include AEM and Adobe Campaign, and our Adobe Analytics Cloud offerings, which includes Audience Manager. Also contributing to the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue were increases in revenue associated with our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings, including Tubemogul which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 41Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2015 Revenue Digital MediaRevenue from Digital Media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings. Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, and continued adoption of our ETLAs. To a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative offerings. Increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offering. Decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate more customers to our Document Cloud, along with increases in Adobe Sign revenue.Digital MarketingRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud, which increased 20% year over year. Increases in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our AEM offerings and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenue associated with Adobe Campaign. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Marketing revenue was the increase in Adobe Analytics Cloud revenue.

During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro and British Pound which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. This impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2016.

Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of December 1, 2017, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018. Comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.42 billion as of December 2, 2016, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments. 43Table of ContentsCost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change2017-2016 % Change2016-2015Subscription $623.0 $461.9 $409.2 35 % 13 %Percentage of total revenue 9% 8% 9% Product 57.1 68.9 90.0 (17)% (23)%Percentage of total revenue 1% 1% 2% Services and support 330.4 289.1 245.1 14 % 18 %Percentage of total revenue 5% 5% 5% Total cost of revenue $1,010.5 $819.9 $744.3 23 % 10 %SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead.

Hosting services and data center costs increased in all periods presented primarily due to the continued increase in transaction volumes in our Adobe Experience Cloud and Creative Cloud offerings. The increase in cost of subscription revenue during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were partially offset by decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles driven by the decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Omniture and Efficient Frontier that became fully amortized in the latter part of fiscal 2015. 44Table of ContentsProduct Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.As a result of redirecting our focus and development efforts towards our Creative Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud subscription offerings, our cost of product revenue declined in all periods presented due to the following: % Change2017-2016 % Change2016-2015Amortization of purchased intangibles(7)% (16)%Localization costs— % (10)%Royalty costs(8)% 10 %Cost of sales(2)% (2)%Excess and obsolete inventory— (3)Various individually insignificant items— (2)Total change(17)% (23)%The decrease in cost of product revenue during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was partially offset by an increase in royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering.

As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.Amortization expense remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The decreases associated with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of TubeMogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change2017-2016 % Change2016-2015Interest and other income (expense), net $36.4 $13.5 $33.9 170 % (60)%Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Interest expense (74.4) (70.4) (64.2) 6 % 10 %Percentage of total revenue (1)% (1)% (1)% Investment gains (losses), net 7.5 (1.6) 1.0 * *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Total non-operating income (expense), net $(30.5) $(58.5) $(29.3) (48)% 100 %_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.(**) Percentage is less than 1%.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher average invested balances and interest rates and a decline in foreign exchange hedging costs. Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to a gain on the sale of certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and an increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset in part by an increase in interest income due to higher average invested balances and interest rates. Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps. 47Table of ContentsInterest expense increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher short-term floating interest rates on interest rate swaps.Interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher short-term floating interest rates on interest rate swaps and higher average debt balances.Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 % Change2017-2016 % Change2016-2015Provision $443.7 $266.4 $244.2 67% 9%Percentage of total revenue 6% 5% 5% Effective tax rate 21% 19% 28% As described in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we early adopted the updated accounting standard for share-based payment accounting during fiscal 2017. As a result, we recorded deferred tax attributes that we were previously tracking pursuant to the rules that preceded this standard. The deferred tax asset recorded with the adoption was offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance.Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. In addition to the above noted items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 U.S. Research and Development credit. Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the U.S. Research and Development credit for 2015 and onward. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2015. A tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. In addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’s trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development credit in December 2014.We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $172.9 million, $178.4 million and $258.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which, $135.0 million, $144.5 million and $220.2 million if recognized, would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were net of the estimated $37.9 million, $33.9 million and $38.5 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 48Table of ContentsThe combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.6 million and $22.4 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts were included in non-current income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)December 1, 2017 December 2, 2016Cash and cash equivalents$2,306.1 $1,011.3Short-term investments$3,513.7 $3,750.0Working capital$3,720.4 $3,028.1Stockholders’ equity$8,459.9 $7,424.8 A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$2,912.9 $2,199.7 $1,469.5Net cash used for investing activities(442.9) (960.0) (1,488.4)Net cash used for financing activities(1,183.7) (1,090.7) (200.7)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents8.5 (14.2) (21.2)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,294.8 $134.8 $(240.8) Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables attributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase.For fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased 49Table of Contentsprimarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. For fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels. Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of TubeMogul. Other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the Almaden Tower and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.For fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. For fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets.See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions and the Almaden Tower purchase, respectively.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.For fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.We used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (“2015 Notes”). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information. In addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 included payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and 50Table of Contentsinvestments totaled $5.82 billion as of December 1, 2017. Of this amount, approximately 89% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. As of our balance sheet date, our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.Subsequent to December 1, 2017, the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “Act”) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that are applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings amount of approximately $4 billion are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. These changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and reclassify approximately $380 million of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years. In addition, based on preliminary estimates, we anticipate a tax provision charge of approximately $85 million in fiscal 2018 predominately due to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings.Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 1, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of December 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion, $1.08 billion, and $625 million, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares at an average price per share of $134.20 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price per share of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. 51Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2017, December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 1, 2017, $101.5 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to December 1, 2017, as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $300 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.6 billion remains under our current authority.

Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At December 1, 2017, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $350.6 million for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.CovenantsOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 1, 2017, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our credit agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesSee Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 53Table of ContentsOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions, except Japanese Yen): Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015Euro€1,044.7 €825.6 €589.6Japanese Yen (in billions)¥51.0 ¥38.7 ¥29.7British Pounds£338.4 £263.5 £192As of December 1, 2017, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $1.24 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $618.4 million in Euros, $225.3 million in British Pounds, $244.5 million in Japanese Yen and $148.9 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 1, 2017, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2018. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements that have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 1, 2017. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $79.7 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $23.6 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $190.5 million and $70.2 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 1, 2017, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because 54Table of Contentsgains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 1, 2017, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt December 1, 2017, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.51 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):Due within one year$1,023.7Due between one and two years1,289.3Due between two and three years812.8Due after three years387.9Total$3,513.7A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 1, 2017. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 (dollars in millions):-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/1/17 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$3,595.2 $3,568.1 $3,540.9 $3,513.7 $3,486.5 $3,459.3 $3,432.1-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/2/16 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$3,828.5 $3,805.9 $3,778.4 $3,750.0 $3,721.6 $3,693.2 $3,664.8Senior NotesAs of December 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 1, 2017, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.88 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $1.98 billion.Other Market RiskPrivately Held Long-Term InvestmentsThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016. 55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:06.463670

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for $4.74 billion and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for $1.64 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we are continuing to integrate Marketo and Magento into our Digital Experience reportable segment.During fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for $560.8 million. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we have integrated TubeMogul into our Digital Experience reportable segment. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma financial information related to the Marketo acquisition. Pro forma information has not been presented for our other acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.Subsequent to November 30, 2018, we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately $105.0 million in cash consideration. Allegorithmic will be integrated into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and •discount rates. 36Table of ContentsIn connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2018For fiscal 2018, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Experience (formerly Digital Marketing), while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-based services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document 37Table of ContentsCloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2018 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2018 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value + Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARRCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2018 was $6.03 billion, up from $4.77 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2018 was $801 million, up from $614 million at the end of fiscal 2017. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $6.83 billion at the end of fiscal 2018, up from $5.39 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2018 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2018 would be $6.71 billion or approximately $123 million lower than the ARR reported above.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2018 was $5.34 billion, up from $4.17 billion in fiscal 2017 and representing 28% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2018 was $981.8 million, up from $836.7 million in fiscal 2017 and representing 17% year-over-year revenue growth as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $6.33 billion in fiscal 2018, up from $5.01 billion in fiscal 2017 and representing 26% year-over-year growth. We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. Our Digital Experience business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, marketing automation, audience management, commerce, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance.Our hierarchy of solutions in the Digital Experience segment, available in our Adobe Experience Cloud, consists of the following cloud offerings:•Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.•Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the 38Table of Contentscapture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.•Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Marketo Engagement Platform and Adobe Primetime.•Magento Commerce Cloud—provides digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence based on a unified commerce platform enabling shopping experiences across a wide array of industries. This cloud offering was integrated into the Adobe Experience Cloud after our acquisition of privately held Magento in June 2018.In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.In October 2018, we acquired privately held marketing cloud platform company Marketo. We began integrating Magento, as discussed above, and Marketo into our Digital Experience business in the second half of fiscal 2018.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.44 billion in fiscal 2018, up from $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017 which represents 20% year-over-year growth. Driving the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2018 from $1.55 billion in fiscal 2017, representing 26% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue, to a lesser extent, was revenue associated with Magento’s commerce platform offerings and Marketo’s marketing cloud platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Marketo and Magento, and continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2018•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $6.83 billion as of November 30, 2018 increased by $1.44 billion, or 27%, from $5.39 billion as of December 1, 2017. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to strong adoption of our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud offerings. •Creative revenue of $5.34 billion increased by $1.17 billion, or 28%, during fiscal 2018, from $4.17 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings.•Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.44 billion increased by $413.4 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2018, from $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings. •Our total deferred revenue of $3.05 billion as of November 30, 2018 increased by $559.1 million, or 22%, from $2.49 billion as of December 1, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in new contracts and the timing of renewals related to our Digital Media offerings and, to a lesser extent, deferred revenue assumed from Magento and Marketo. •Cost of revenue of $1.19 billion increased by $184.5 million, or 18%, during fiscal 2018, from $1.01 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in media rebill costs associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings and hosting services and data center costs.•Operating expenses of $4.99 billion increased by $871.7 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2018, from $4.12 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in base compensation and related benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense associated with headcount growth. 39Table of Contents•Net income of $2.59 billion increased by $896.8 million, or 53%, during fiscal 2018 from $1.69 billion in fiscal 2017 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in the provision for income taxes. •Net cash flow from operations of $4.03 billion during fiscal 2018 increased by $1.12 billion, or 38%, from $2.91 billion during fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net income. Revenue (dollars in millions)Revenue for fiscal 2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53-week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2018 and 2017, which were 52-week years.

Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue across all of our Creative Cloud offerings driven by the increase in net new subscriptions. Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increases in subscriptions revenue driven by strong adoption of our Document Cloud.Digital ExperienceRevenue from Digital Experience increased $413.4 million during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily driven by continued adoption of our AEM offerings which is part of our Marketing Cloud and growth in revenue associated with our Analytics Cloud. Also contributing to the increase in subscription revenue, but to a lesser extent, was revenue associated with our Magento Commerce Cloud and Advertising Cloud. 41Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2016 Revenue Digital MediaRevenue from Digital Media increased $1.07 billion during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings. Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in individual, team and enterprise subscriptions. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in Document Cloud subscription revenue, offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetually licensed Acrobat offering. Also contributing to the increase in Document Cloud revenue was an increase in Adobe Sign revenue. Digital ExperienceRevenue from Digital Experience increased $398.9 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by strong performance with our Marketing Cloud offerings, which include AEM and Adobe Campaign, and our Analytics Cloud offerings, which includes Audience Manager.

The overall increase in EMEA revenue was slightly offset by declines due to the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar against EMEA currencies as discussed below. 42Table of ContentsIncluded in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

In addition, we had $48.6 million in hedging gains from our EMEA currency hedging programs during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the British Pound, which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. The net foreign currency impact to revenue was offset in part by hedging gains from our EMEA and Japanese Yen currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2017. See Note 17 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.BacklogDeferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancellable commercial subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of November 30, 2018, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog, including that of our fiscal 2018 acquisitions, of approximately $5.05 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2019. Comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion as of December 1, 2017, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments. 43Table of ContentsCost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change2018-2017 % Change2017-2016Subscription $807.2 $623.0 $461.9 30 % 35 %Percentage of total revenue 9% 9% 8% Product 46.0 57.1 68.9 (19)% (17)%Percentage of total revenue 1% 1% 1% Services and support 341.8 330.4 289.1 3 % 14 %Percentage of total revenue 4% 5% 5% Total cost of revenue $1,195.0 $1,010.5 $819.9 18 % 23 %SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead.

Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2018 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to our revenue growing at a faster pace compared with the increases in sales and marketing expenses.

As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively, and partially offset by certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions. We expect that intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo will continue to increase our amortization expense in future periods.Amortization expense remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The decreases associated with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of TubeMogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 46Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change2018-2017 % Change2017-2016Interest and other income (expense), net $39.5 $36.4 $13.5 9% 170 %Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Interest expense (89.2) (74.4) (70.4) 20% 6 %Percentage of total revenue (1)% (1)% (1)% Investment gains (losses), net 3.2 7.5 (1.6) * *Percentage of total revenue ** ** ** Total non-operating income (expense), net $(46.5) $(30.5) $(58.5) 52% (48)%_________________________________________ (*) Percentage is not meaningful.(**) Percentage is less than 1%.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher average invested balances and interest rates and a decline in foreign exchange hedging costs. Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our term loan, senior notes and interest rate swaps. In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan for the purpose of partially funding the purchase price for our acquisition of Marketo. Interest on our Term Loan is payable periodically at the end of each interest period, whereas interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps and debt, respectively. Interest expense increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher short-term floating interest rates on interest rate swaps and higher average debt balances.Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 % Change2018-2017 % Change2017-2016Provision $203.1 $443.7 $266.4 (54)% 67%Percentage of total revenue 2% 6% 5% Effective tax rate 7% 21% 19% Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 14 percentage points during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 and a change to our corporate tax structure from which we serve our foreign customers that provided us the ability to deduct more expenses against our earnings in the U.S.Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to 47Table of Contentsstock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. In addition to the above noted items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 U.S. Research and Development credit.The above noted Tax Act transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate tax rate is a blended rate of 22.2%, which will be reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019 and thereafter. During fiscal 2018, we recorded tax charges for the impact of the Tax Act effects using the current available information and technical guidance on the interpretations of the Tax Act. As permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recorded provisional estimates and have subsequently finalized our accounting analysis based on the guidance, interpretations, and data available as of November 30, 2018. Adjustments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 upon finalization of our accounting analysis were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we remeasured our deferred taxes and recorded a tax charge of $10 million based on the tax rate that is expected to apply when such deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods. To calculate the remeasurement of deferred taxes, we estimated when the existing deferred taxes will be settled or realized.As part of the adoption of a new territorial tax system we recorded a transition tax expense of $176 million on deferred foreign earnings, long-term income taxes payable of $504 million, other tax liabilities of $19 million, and a reduction in our deferred tax liabilities of $347 million. We intend to elect to pay the federal transition tax over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. As a result, we reclassified $40 million from long-term income taxes payable to short-term income taxes payable for the first installment payment due in fiscal 2019. We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. As part of the adoption of a territorial tax system, the Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. As we repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax.See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $196.2 million, $172.9 million and $178.4 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 30, 2018, December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 were recognized, $145.2 million, $135.0 million and $144.5 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates, which were net of estimated $51.0 million, $37.9 million, and $33.9 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $24.6 million and $23.6 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of short-term and long-term assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential effect in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $45 million. 48Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities of $4.03 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items, including adjustments to deferred income taxes related to the Tax Act. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases to taxes payable and deferred revenue. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily driven by the one-time transition tax recorded pursuant to the Tax Act. The increase in deferred revenue was principally due to increases in Digital Media site and term licenses and from our acquisition of Magento and Marketo in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. The primary working capital use of cash was the increase in prepaid expenses driven by the timing of billings and payments of maintenance and support services associated with our licensed technologies and increases in prepaid insurance.For fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Experience hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media receivables attributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase. For fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Experience hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid. 49Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2018, net cash used for investing activities of $4.69 billion was primarily due to our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. Other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment and short-term investments. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments.For fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of TubeMogul. Other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the Almaden Tower and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. For fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $5.6 million. Primary uses of cash were payments made for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. These were offset by the proceeds of our $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) which partially funded our acquisition of Marketo. Funds were received net of issuance costs on October 31, 2018 upon closing of the acquisition. The Term Loan will mature 18 months following the initial funding date. For fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.For fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Other Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2019 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. On October 17, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaces our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of March 2, 2012. The new credit agreement continues to provide for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of November 30, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 30, 2018, we have a $2.25 billion Term Loan outstanding due April 30, 2020. As of November 30, 2018, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes and Term Loan rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. 50Table of ContentsSubsequent to November 30, 2018, we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic for approximately $105.0 million in cash consideration. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of Allegorithmic.Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us additional authority to repurchase up to $8.0 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.05 billion, $1.10 billion, and $1.08 billion, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. The following is a summary of our stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except average per share amounts):Board ApprovalDate Repurchases Under the Plan 2018 2017 2016 Shares Average Shares Average Shares AverageJanuary 2015 Structured repurchases — $— 4,263 $118.00 10,428 $97.16January 2017 Structured repurchases 8,686 $230.43 3,923 $151.80 — $—Total shares 8,686 $230.43 8,186 $134.20 10,428 $97.16Total cost $2,001,500 $1,098,595 $1,013,131For fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 30, 2018, December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 30, 2018, $150.0 million of prepayments from our May 2018 authority remained under the agreement. Subsequent to November 30, 2018, as part of the $8 billion stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $500 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $500 million stock repurchase agreement, $7.35 billion remains under our May 2018 authority. As of November 30, 2018, there is no remaining balance under our January 2017 authority. See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 30, 2018.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 30, 2018 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments. 51Table of ContentsTransition Taxes LiabilityAs a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, all historical undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings were subject to a mandatory one-time transition tax. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a transition tax liability of $504 million and other tax liabilities, including state, of $6 million. Under an election of the Tax Act, the transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2019, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As we repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S., the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. We continuously evaluate the future cash needs of our global operations to determine the amount of foreign earnings that is not necessary to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2018 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsNotes and Term Loan, including interest $4,538.5 $153.3 $3,271.2 $65.0 $1,049.0Operating lease obligations 666.5 79.4 156.1 119.1 311.9Purchase obligations 733.8 346.3 335.3 48.2 4.0Total $5,938.8 $579.0 $3,762.6 $232.3 $1,364.9Term LoanAs of November 30, 2018, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. Based on the LIBOR rate at November 30, 2018, our estimated maximum commitment for interest payments was $112.8 million for the remaining duration of the Term Loan.Senior NotesAs of November 30, 2018, our outstanding Notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying value of $1.88 billion. Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 30, 2018, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $275.4 million for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.CovenantsOur Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement contain similar financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants. Under the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesSee Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue. 52Table of ContentsIndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions, except Japanese Yen): Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016Euro€1,309.9 €1,044.7 €825.6Japanese Yen (in billions)¥60.8 ¥51.0 ¥38.7British Pounds£423.1 £338.4 £263.5As of November 30, 2018, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $1.55 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $805.0 million in Euros, $275.3 million in British Pounds, $331.8 million in Japanese Yen and $140.3 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 30, 2018, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2019. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements that have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 30, 2018. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $48.2 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $60.7 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017, this long-term investment exposure 53Table of Contentstotaled an absolute notional equivalent of $292.3 million and $190.5 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 30, 2018, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 30, 2018, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.59 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):Due within one year$612.1Due between one and two years564.2Due between two and three years282.2Due after three years127.7Total$1,586.2A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 30, 2018. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes. 54Table of ContentsThe following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017 (dollars in millions):-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/30/18 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$1,617.5 $1,607.1 $1,596.6 $1,586.2 $1,575.7 $1,565.3 $1,554.8-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 12/1/17 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$3,595.2 $3,568.1 $3,540.9 $3,513.7 $3,486.5 $3,459.3 $3,432.1Term Loan As of November 30, 2018, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.Senior NotesAs of November 30, 2018, the amount outstanding under our Notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of November 30, 2018, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.88 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $1.89 billion.Other Market RiskPrivately Held Long-Term InvestmentsThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not significant as of November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017. 55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:05:04.493902
796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2020,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on January 25,2019.ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment.During fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for $4.73 billion and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for $1.64 billion, and integrated them into our Digital Experience reportable segment.During fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for $560.8 million, and integrated it into our Digital Experience reportable segment. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions, including pro forma financial information related to the Marketo acquisition. Pro forma information has not been presented for our other acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences, and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile, and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition, and automated document tagging. 38Table of ContentsBusiness CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and •discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. 39Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2019For fiscal 2019, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Experience, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.On December 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, we adopted the requirements of the new revenue standard utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition, and began to report our financial results under the new revenue standard. The impact of the adoption was not significant to our results of operations. In our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users as a result of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue, unbilled backlog and remaining performance obligation as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARR 40Table of ContentsCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2019 was $7.31 billion, up from $5.92 billion at the end of fiscal 2018. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2019 was $1.09 billion, up from $791 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $8.40 billion at the end of fiscal 2019, up from $6.71 billion at the end of fiscal 2018. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2019 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2019, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2019 would be $8.33 billion or approximately $66 million lower than the ARR reported above.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2019 was $6.48 billion, up from $5.34 billion in fiscal 2018 and representing 21% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2019 was $1.22 billion, up from $981.8 million in fiscal 2018 and representing 25% year-over-year revenue growth. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $7.71 billion in fiscal 2019, up from $6.33 billion in fiscal 2018 and representing 22% year-over-year growth. We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. Our Digital Experience business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, marketing automation, audience management, commerce, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance.During fiscal 2019, our hierarchy of solutions in the Digital Experience segment consisted of the following cloud offerings:•Adobe Advertising Cloud—delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens.•Adobe Analytics Cloud—enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.•Adobe Marketing Cloud—provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (“AEM”), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Marketo Engage and Adobe Primetime.•Adobe Commerce Cloud—provides digital commerce, order management and predictive intelligence based on a unified commerce platform enabling shopping experiences across a wide array of industries; includes Magento Commerce. In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Digital Experience revenue of $3.21 billion in fiscal 2019, up from $2.44 billion in fiscal 2018 which represents 31% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $2.67 billion in fiscal 2019 from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2018, representing 37% year-over-year growth. Largely contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Marketo Engage. To a lesser extent, subscription revenue associated with Magento Commerce and Adobe Experience Manager also contributed to the overall increase. We expect that continued demand across our portfolio of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, including new offerings and enhancements to existing solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years. 41Table of ContentsOur financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with the new revenue standard that was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Prior period results have not been restated which limits the comparability of our results of operations for fiscal 2019 when compared to the year-ago period. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding adoption of the new revenue standard. Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2019•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $8.40 billion as of November 29, 2019 increased by $1.69 billion, or 25%, from $6.71 billion as of November 30, 2018. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to stronger new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud offerings. •Creative revenue of $6.48 billion increased by $1.14 billion, or 21%, during fiscal 2019, from $5.34 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings.•Digital Experience revenue of $3.21 billion increased by $762.4 million, or 31%, during fiscal 2019, from $2.44 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue driven by the addition of Marketo and Magento, which we acquired in the later part of fiscal 2018.•Our total deferred revenue of $3.50 billion as of November 29, 2019 increased by $447.1 million, or 15%, from $3.05 billion as of November 30, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in new contracts and the timing of renewals for offerings with cloud-enabled services and hosted services. •Cost of revenue of $1.67 billion increased by $477.7 million, or 40%, during fiscal 2019, from $1.19 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in amortization of intangibles from our acquisition of Magento and Marketo in the later part of fiscal 2018. To a lesser extent, increases in hosting services and data center costs also contributed to the overall increase in cost of revenue. •Operating expenses of $6.23 billion increased by $1.24 billion, or 25%, during fiscal 2019, from $4.99 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in base compensation and related benefits costs and stock-based compensation expense associated with headcount growth, including additions from the acquisitions of Magento and Marketo in the later part of fiscal 2018. To a lesser extent, increases in marketing spend also contributed to the overall increase in operating expenses. •Net income of $2.95 billion increased by $360.7 million, or 14%, during fiscal 2019 from $2.59 billion in fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases in revenue and offset in part by the increases in operating expenses and cost of revenue. •Net cash flow from operations of $4.42 billion during fiscal 2019 increased by $392.5 million, or 10%, from $4.03 billion during fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. This increase was offset in part by comparatively lower increases in income taxes payable and higher increases in prepaid expenses and other assets.

Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed Creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue across all of our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in net new subscriptions. Adobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue driven by strong adoption of our Document Cloud. 43Table of ContentsDigital ExperienceRevenue from Digital Experience increased $762.5 million during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our Experience Cloud offerings. Largely contributing to the subscription revenue increases were revenue associated with Marketo Engage, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, and revenue associated with our Magento Commerce offerings. Also contributing to the subscription revenue growth were increases in our AEM and Campaign offerings.

Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our cash flow hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

The foreign currency impact to revenue was offset in part by hedging gains primarily from our EMEA currencies cash flow hedging programs during fiscal 2019.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of revenue by geography.BacklogAdoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes to our measurement of unbilled backlog starting in fiscal 2019 such that orders with a right of termination and unbilled amounts recognized as revenue under the new revenue standard are not included in our unbilled backlog, consistent with our measurement of remaining performance obligations. Our unbilled backlog represents expected future billings not yet recognized in revenue that are contractually committed under our existing subscription agreements. As of November 29, 2019, we had unbilled backlog of $6.38 billion, which excludes amounts cancellable without substantive penalty. Approximately $2.61 billion of our unbilled backlog is not reasonably expected to be recognized during fiscal 44Table of Contents2020. As of November 30, 2018, we had unbilled backlog of approximately $5.05 billion, which was measured under the accounting standard in effect for that period.We expect that the amount of unbilled backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, timing of customer renewals, timing of revenue recognition, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Our presentation of unbilled backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry.

Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses.Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our Term Loan, senior notes and interest rate swaps. In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan for the purpose of partially funding the purchase price for our acquisition of Marketo. Interest on our Term Loan is payable periodically at the end of each interest period, whereas interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 6 and 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps and debt, respectively. Interest expense increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to interest on our Term Loan which was entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.Investment gains increased during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the gain recognized upon our acquisition of the remaining interest in Allegorithmic in January 2019, which was accounted for as an equity-method investment immediately before the acquisition. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our acquisition of Allegorithmic.Provision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2017 % Change2019-2018 % Change2018-2017Provision $253.3 $203.1 $443.7 25% (54)%Percentage of total revenue 2% 2% 6% Effective tax rate 8% 7% 21% Our effective tax rate increased by approximately one percentage point during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 included U.S. federal and state taxes associated with our current year international earnings resulting from the international provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) effective this year and for additional foreign taxation on our foreign operations. This increase was offset in part by the provisional accounting expense recorded in the prior year for the effects of the Tax Act adoption.Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 14 percentage points during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, which included the reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018, and a related change to our corporate tax structure from which we serve our foreign customers that provided us the ability to deduct more expenses against our earnings in the U.S.Beginning in our fiscal 2019, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21% and certain international provisions of the Tax Act, such as a tax on global intangible low-tax income, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax and a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, took effect. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that could impact the calculation of taxes related to these provisions and which are anticipated to be applicable on a retroactive basis. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact, such regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. We will account for new regulations in the period of enactment.We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related primarily to the realizability of state and foreign credits. Total valuation allowance was $244.4 million as of November 29, 2019. 48Table of ContentsWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax.Subsequent to November 29, 2019, final and proposed tax regulations were issued that are applicable to Adobe. We are currently evaluating the impact of these enacted and issued regulations, but we do not anticipate they will have a material impact to our fiscal 2020 operating results.The Tax Act included certain international provisions effective for us starting in fiscal 2019. As discussed in Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors, the applicability and impact of these new tax provisions, and of other international tax law changes effective for fiscal 2020 and beyond, will likely require us to respond by making change(s) to our international trading structure. The net impact of such change(s) is uncertain but is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rate and cash flows in years beyond fiscal 2020. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $173.3 million, $196.2 million and $172.9 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 29, 2019, November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017 were recognized, $127.0 million, $145.2 million and $135.0 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $25.1 million and $24.6 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $20 million.In addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. 49Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of(in millions)November 29, 2019 November 30, 2018Cash and cash equivalents$2,650.2 $1,642.8Short-term investments$1,526.8 $1,586.2Working capital$(1,696.0) $555.9Stockholders’ equity$10,530.2 $9,362.1Working CapitalWorking capital as of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018 was $1.70 billion of a deficit and $555.9 million of a surplus, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the reclassification of $3.15 billion total carrying value of our $2.25 billion term loan due April 30, 2020 (“Term Loan”) and $900 million 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”) to current liabilities. We intend to refinance our Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates. A summary of our cash flows is as follows:(in millions)2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$4,421.8 $4,029.3 $2,912.9Net cash used for investing activities(455.6) (4,685.3) (442.9)Net cash used for financing activities(2,946.1) (5.6) (1,183.7)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(12.7) (1.7) 8.5Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,007.4 $(663.3) $1,294.8 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, net cash provided by operating activities of $4.42 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with an increase in deferred revenue, which was offset in large part by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by increases related to Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services and Digital Experience hosted services. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses with certain vendors, sales commissions paid and capitalized, advanced payments related to income taxes and increase in long-term contract assets.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, net cash used for investing activities of $455.6 million was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment and our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Allegorithmic. These cash outflows were offset primarily by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $2.95 billion primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. 50Table of ContentsOther Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2020 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct costs and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of November 29, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 29, 2019, we have a $2.25 billion Term Loan outstanding and $1.9 billion senior notes outstanding, consisting of our 2020 Notes and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes and Term Loan rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the 2020 Notes as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we reclassified the Term Loan as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 29, 2019, the carrying value of the 2020 Notes was $899.6 million which includes the fair value of the related interest rate swap and is net of debt issuance costs, and the carrying value of the Term Loan was $2.25 billion, net of unamortized original issuance discount. We intend to refinance the Term Loan and 2020 Notes on or before the due dates.During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our Term Loan and 2020 Notes, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon debt issuance.Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, municipal securities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our investment portfolio. Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $2.75 billion, $2.05 billion, and $1.10 billion, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. 51Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of our structured stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017:(shares in thousands and total cost in millions) 2019 2018 2017Board approval dates Shares Average per share Shares Average per share Shares Average per shareJanuary 2015 — $— — $— 4,263 $118.00January 2017 — $— 8,686 $230.43 3,923 $151.80May 2018 9,883 $270.23 — $— — $—Total shares 9,883 $270.23 8,686 $230.43 8,186 $134.20Total cost $2,671 $2,002 $1,099For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 29, 2019, November 30, 2018 and December 1, 2017 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 29, 2019, $229.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to November 29, 2019, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $850 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $850 million stock repurchase agreement, $4.25 billion remains under our May 2018 authority. See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 29, 2019.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 29, 2019 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 29, 2019:(in millions) Payment Due by Period Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsTerm Loan and Notes, including interest $4,373.3 $3,227.0 $65.0 $65.0 $1,016.3Operating lease obligations, net 711.5 88.7 158.0 126.9 337.9Purchase obligations 2,036.5 545.0 935.8 555.7 —Total $7,121.3 $3,860.7 $1,158.8 $747.6 $1,354.2As of November 29, 2019, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. Based on the LIBOR rate at November 29, 2019, our estimated maximum commitment for interest payments was $23.2 million for the remaining duration of the Term Loan.As of November 29, 2019, the carrying value of our Notes payable was $1.89 billion. Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 29, 2019, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $200.1 million for the remaining duration of our Notes.Our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement contain similar financial covenants requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 29, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. 52Table of ContentsUnder the terms of our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Transition Taxes LiabilityAs a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, an accrued transition tax liability of approximately $427.1 million as of November 29, 2019 is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesSee Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above and Note10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows :(in millions, except Japanese Yen)2019 2018 2017Euro€1,603.2 €1,309.9 €1,044.7Japanese Yen (in billions)¥73.2 ¥60.8 ¥51.0British Pounds£503.3 £423.1 £338.4As of November 29, 2019, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $1.90 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $927.0 million in Euros, $431.0 million in British Pounds, $341.3 million in Japanese Yen and $201.8 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 29, 2019, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2020. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement 53Table of Contentstransactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 29, 2019. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $113.6 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $33.4 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $385.2 million and $292.3 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended November 29, 2019, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At November 29, 2019, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 54Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 29, 2019, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.53 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 29, 2019. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018: (dollars in millions) -150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/29/19 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$1,544.8 $1,538.8 $1,532.8 $1,526.8 $1,520.7 $1,514.7 $1,508.7-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS Fair Value 11/30/18 +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$1,617.5 $1,607.1 $1,596.6 $1,586.2 $1,575.7 $1,565.3 $1,554.8Term Loan As of November 29, 2019, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.Senior NotesAs of November 29, 2019, the amount outstanding under our Notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of November 29, 2019, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.89 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $1.96 billion.Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate RiskIn June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our anticipated refinancing. We record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the anticipated refinancing. Upon refinancing and termination of the derivative instruments, their fair value will be amortized over the term of our new debt to interest expense. 55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:04:48.202298
796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2021,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 29, 2019, filed with the SEC on January 21, 2020.ACQUISITIONS Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2019, we acquired the remaining interest in Allegorithmic SAS (“Allegorithmic”), a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, for approximately $106 million in cash consideration, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment.During fiscal 2018, we completed our acquisitions of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion and Magento, a privately held commerce platform company, for approximately $1.64 billion, and integrated them into our Digital Experience reportable segment.We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions, including pro forma financial information related to the Marketo acquisition. Pro forma information has not been presented for our other acquisitions during the fiscal years presented as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in 42Table of Contentsreal time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and •discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices, application of tax rules, and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) which resulted in the establishment of deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. The sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of the valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities.43Table of ContentsRecent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2020For our fiscal 2020, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media offerings consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans with respect to this segment. In our Digital Experience segment, we continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we began to discontinue our transaction-driven Advertising Cloud offerings, allowing us to focus our investment on strategic growth initiatives. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined Advertising Cloud with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management. Digital MediaIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users as a result of low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services, including Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.44Table of ContentsAnnualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue, unbilled backlog and remaining performance obligation as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARRCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $8.72 billion, up from $7.25 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $1.46 billion, up from $1.08 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $10.18 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, up from $8.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2020 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2021, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2020 would be $10.26 billion or approximately $77 million higher than the ARR reported above.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2020 was $7.74 billion, up from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 19% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2020 was $1.50 billion, up from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth and reflecting an increase in demand driven by the shift to remote work as well as our continued efforts to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $7.71 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 20% year-over-year growth. These increases were driven by strong net new user growth, including those resulting from the current work-from-home environment reflecting expanded digital engagement.Digital ExperienceWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.Adobe Experience Cloud is focused on delivering solutions for our enterprise customers across the following strategic growth pillars:•Customer data and insights. Our solutions deliver real-time customer profiles and intelligence across the customer journey. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, Real-time Customer Data Platform and Intelligent Services.•Content and commerce. Our solutions to help customers manage, deliver, test, target and optimize content delivery and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Commerce.•Customer journey management. Our solutions help businesses manage, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases. Our offerings include Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage and Journey Orchestration.In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business 45Table of Contentswith the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. Digital Experience revenue for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect the Advertising Cloud segment move. Digital Experience revenue was $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019 which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020 from $2.28 billion in fiscal 2019, representing 17% year-over-year growth. COVID-19 UPDATEIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This pandemic has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. As a result, we have taken action to direct our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replace in-person events such as Adobe Summit and MAX, with digital events through July 2021. During the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This macro trend towards all things digital has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions and accelerated the tailwinds that benefit our business, which contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2020•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $10.18 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.85 billion, or 22%, from $8.33 billion as of November 29, 2019. The increase in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings. •Creative revenue of $7.74 billion increased by $1.25 billion, or 19%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019. Document Cloud revenue of $1.50 billion increased by $272 million, or 22%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.•Digital Experience revenue of $3.13 billion increased by $330 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2020, from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.•Remaining performance obligation of $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.52 billion, or 15%, from $9.82 billion as of November 29, 2019, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings. •Cost of revenue of $1.72 billion increased by $49 million, or 3%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.67 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, offset in large part by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.•Operating expenses of $6.91 billion increased by $679 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend. These increases were offset in part by decreases in travel-related expenses. •Net income of $5.26 billion increased by $2.31 billion, or 78%, during fiscal 2020 from $2.95 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in revenue and the non-recurring benefit from income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights. 46Table of Contents•Net cash flows from operations of $5.73 billion during fiscal 2020 increased by $1.31 billion, or 30%, from $4.42 billion during fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items.Presentation ChangesIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined our Advertising Cloud offerings with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management. Further, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our Advertising Cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our Consolidated Statements of Income.Financial information for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect these reclassifications. There were no other updates to disclosures included in our prior year report in relation to the reclassifications.RevenueOur financial results for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019.

Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our cash flow hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

Interest on our Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Interest on our Term Loan, which was terminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, was payable periodically at the end of each interest period. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps, which matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, were paid monthly and the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps was received semi-annually concurrent with the Notes interest payments.Interest expense decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt instruments that were refinanced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.52Table of ContentsInvestment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.Investment gains (losses), net decreased during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the gain recognized upon our acquisition of the remaining interest in Allegorithmic in January 2019.Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Other income (expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses.Other income (expense), remained stable during fiscal 2020 primarily due to decreases in interest income driven by lower average interest rates offset by our change in methodology of accounting for foreign currency cash flow hedges. Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, option premiums, which were previously recorded in other income (expense), net, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes (dollars in millions)202020192018% Change2020-2019Provision for (benefit from) income taxes$(1,084)$254 $203 **Percentage of total revenue(8)%2 %2 % Effective tax rate(26)%8 %7 % _________________________________________(**) Percentage is not meaningful.Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 34 percentage points during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. The change is primarily due to non-recurring tax benefits resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights (“IP rights”) completed during fiscal 2020. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights, a favorable geographic mix of earnings and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit. In years beyond fiscal 2020, the change in the geographic mix of international income resulting from these transfers is anticipated to adversely affect our effective income tax rates and cash flows. However, the adverse impact to effective rates for cash paid for income taxes will be partially offset by future deductions on the transferred IP rights.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Act was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us. Certain international provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, such as a tax on global intangible low-tax income, a base erosion and anti-abuse tax and a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, took effect in fiscal 2019. As the U.S. Treasury releases regulations that impact these provisions, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment.We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $276 million as of November 27, 2020 and is primarily attributable to certain state and foreign credits and foreign intangible assets. 53Table of ContentsWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. The current U.S. tax law provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax.In June 2020, California enacted legislation which includes a limitation on the utilization of research and development tax credits for a three-year period beginning in fiscal 2021. The net impact of the legislation is uncertain but is anticipated to increase our California tax and, consequently, adversely impact our effective tax rates for the three-year period beginning in fiscal 2021.See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $201 million, $173 million and $196 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2020, November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018 were recognized, $136 million, $116 million and $136 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $26 million and $25 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $20 million over the next 12 months.In addition, in countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices, application of tax rules and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.54Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.As of(in millions)November 27, 2020November 29, 2019Cash and cash equivalents$4,478 $2,650 Short-term investments$1,514 $1,527 Working capital$2,634 $(1,696)Stockholders’ equity$13,264 $10,530 Working CapitalWorking capital as of November 27, 2020 and November 29, 2019 was $2.63 billion of a surplus and $1.70 billion of a deficit, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced our 2.25 billion term loan due April 30, 2020 (“Term Loan”) and $900 million 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (“2020 Notes”). See the section titled “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. A summary of our cash flows for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:(in millions)202020192018Net cash provided by operating activities$5,727 $4,422 $4,029 Net cash used for investing activities(414)(456)(4,685)Net cash used for financing activities(3,488)(2,946)(5)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents3 (13)(2)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,828 $1,007 $(663)Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue and, to a lesser extent, proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. The primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities of $5.73 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income together with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables, which were offset in part by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by Digital Media offerings with cloud-enabled services, and the decrease in trade receivables was largely attributable to strong collections. The primary working capital use of cash was due to increases in prepaid expenses and other assets driven by sales commissions paid and capitalized and, to a lesser extent, increases due to the timing of billings and payments associated with certain vendors.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2020, net cash used for investing activities of $414 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2020, net cash used for financing activities of $3.49 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” discussed below.In February 2020, we issued $500 million of 1.70% senior notes due February 1, 2023 (“2023 Notes”), $500 million of 1.90% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (“1.90% 2025 Notes”), $850 million of 2.15% senior notes due February 1, 2027 (“2027 Notes”) and $1.30 billion of 2.30% senior notes due February 1, 2030 (“2030 Notes”). We used the proceeds to repay the Term Loan and 2020 Notes concurrently. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our debt refinancing.55Table of ContentsOther Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2021 due to changes in our planned cash outlay. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” While the pandemic has not negatively impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 27, 2020 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities and time deposits. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.We have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of November 27, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. As of November 27, 2020, we have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, consisting of the 2023 Notes, 1.90% 2025 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and the $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the “3.25% 2025 Notes,” and together with the aforementioned notes, the “Notes”). The Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. As of November 27, 2020, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $550 million to $650 million, primarily to fund our San Jose and Bangalore construction projects through fiscal 2022. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.5 billion in cash consideration. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted us an authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $3.05 billion, $2.75 billion, and $2.05 billion, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is expected to be higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount.56Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of our structured stock repurchases executed with large financial institutions during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:(in millions, except average price per share)202020192018Board approval datesSharesAverage per shareSharesAverage per shareSharesAverage per shareJanuary 2017— $— — $— 8.7 $230.43 May 20188.0 $376.38 9.9 $270.23 — $— Total cost$3,024$2,671$2,002For fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2020, November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2020, $255 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $950 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $950 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.1 billion remains under our May 2018 authority. Further, in December 2020, our Board of Directors granted us additional authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2024. We have not drawn from our new $15 billion authority as of the issuance of these financial statements.See Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 27, 2020.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 27, 2020 consist of our Notes and obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Notes 16, 17 and 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 27, 2020:(in millions) Payment Due by Period TotalLess than1 year1-3 years3-5 yearsMore than5 yearsNotes, including interest$4,763 $99 $693 $1,659 $2,312 Operating lease obligations657 104 162 119 272 Purchase obligations 1,885 872 1,012 1 — Total$7,305 $1,075 $1,867 $1,779 $2,584 Senior NotesAs of November 27, 2020, the carrying value of our Notes was $4.12 billion. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At November 27, 2020, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $613 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding Notes.CovenantsOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 27, 2020, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants.Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.57Table of ContentsTransition Taxes LiabilityOur transition tax liability which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act was approximately $390 million as of November 27, 2020 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. The U.S. Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017, including certain earnings that were not subject to the one-time transition or global intangible low-tax income tax. As we repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings for use in the U.S., the distributions will generally not be subject to further U.S. federal tax.Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesSee Results of Operations - Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes above and Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.RoyaltiesWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold or a percentage of the underlying revenue.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director’s or officer’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows :(in millions)202020192018Euro€1,887 €1,603 €1,310 Japanese Yen¥88,640 ¥73,158 ¥60,791 British Pounds£562 £503 £423 Australian Dollars$645 $538 $441 As of November 27, 2020, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $2.03 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $923 million in Euros, $385 million in Japanese Yen, $321 million in British Pounds, $212 million in Australian Dollars and $186 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 27, 2020, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2021. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that 58Table of Contentsprovide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 27, 2020. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $97 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $9 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 27, 2020 and November 29, 2019, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $598 million and $385 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended November 27, 2020, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At November 27, 2020, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial instruments.59Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt November 27, 2020, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.51 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 27, 2020. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.

796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2022,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 27, 2020, filed with the SEC on January 15, 2021.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop acquired technologies and patents internally into commercially viable products;38Table of Contents•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and •discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our research and development tax credits, intercompany transfer pricing practices and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have a significant impact on the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. ACQUISITIONS In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.18 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media reportable segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.39Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2021For our fiscal 2021, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media offerings consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans with respect to this segment. In our Digital Experience segment, we continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings. Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.Digital MediaIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ machines, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products, continuing to acquire users with our low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.In October 2021, we acquired Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media segment.We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services, including Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (“DDOM”) and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys. As a result, we observed strong growth in Digital Media revenue during fiscal 2021.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the 40Table of Contentscurrent fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARRCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2021 was $10.30 billion, up from $8.78 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2021 was $1.93 billion, up from $1.47 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $12.24 billion at the end of fiscal 2021, up from $10.26 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2021 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2022, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2021 would be $12.15 billion or approximately $86 million lower than the ARR reported above.Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2021 was $9.55 billion, up from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020 and representing 23% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2021 was $1.97 billion, up from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2020 and representing 32% year-over-year growth which reflected an increase in demand driven by new user acquisition for our Document Cloud subscription offerings. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $11.52 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020 and representing 25% year-over-year growth. These increases were driven by strong net new user growth, including those resulting from the current work-from-home environment reflecting expanded digital engagement.Digital ExperienceWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.In December 2020, we acquired Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, and integrated Workfront into our Digital Experience segment.Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the following strategic growth pillars:•Data insights and audiences. Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver robust customer profiles and AI-powered analytics across the customer journey to provide timely, relevant experiences across platforms.•Content and commerce. Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and optimize content delivery, through Adobe Experience Manager and to enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses, with Adobe Commerce.•Customer journeys. Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases, including through Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Journey Optimizer. •Marketing workflow. We offer Adobe Workfront, a work management platform directed toward marketers to orchestrate campaign workflows.In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business 41Table of Contentswith the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. Digital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront’s workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.COVID-19 UPDATEThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess, conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As a result, we have reopened our offices in areas with sustained low infection rates and are allowing fully vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.During the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings. •Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2020. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.•Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.•Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition. •Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.•Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend.42Table of Contents•Net income of $4.82 billion decreased by $438 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021 from $5.26 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the change in provision for income taxes, which was largely driven by the non-recurring benefit from income taxes recognized in fiscal 2020 associated with our intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights. To a lesser extent, net income was also impacted by increases in operating expenses, offset by increases in revenue.•Net cash flows from operations of $7.23 billion during fiscal 2021 increased by $1.50 billion, or 26%, from $5.73 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items and increases in deferred revenue, partially offset by increases in trade receivables.Revenue(dollars in millions)202120202019% Change2021-2020Subscription$14,573 $11,626 $9,634 25 %Percentage of total revenue92 %90 %86 % Product555 507 648 9 %Percentage of total revenue4 %4 %6 % Services and other657 735 889 (11)%Percentage of total revenue4 %6 %8 % Total revenue$15,785 $12,868 $11,171 23 %SubscriptionOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings, and related support, including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services.

We primarily recognize product revenue at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.Services and OtherOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.43Table of ContentsSegments In fiscal 2021, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:•Digital Media—Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.

Revenue associated with our Creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, increased during fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in net new subscriptions across our Creative Cloud offerings. Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue driven by strong new user acquisition of our Document Cloud offerings.Digital ExperienceRevenue from Digital Experience increased $742 million during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings including from our Workfront acquisition. 44Table of ContentsGeographical Information(dollars in millions)202120202019% Change2021-2020Americas$8,996 $7,454 $6,506 21 %Percentage of total revenue57 %58 %58 % EMEA4,252 3,400 2,975 25 %Percentage of total revenue27 %26 %27 % APAC2,537 2,014 1,690 26 %Percentage of total revenue16 %16 %15 % Total revenue$15,785 $12,868 $11,171 23 %Overall revenue during fiscal 2021 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in Digital Media revenue and, to a lesser extent, increases in Digital Experience revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 were impacts associated with foreign currency which were mitigated in part by our foreign currency hedging program. During fiscal 2021, the U.S. Dollar primarily weakened against EMEA currencies and the Australian Dollar as compared to fiscal 2020, which increased revenue in U.S. Dollar equivalents by $276 million. During fiscal 2021, the foreign currency impacts to revenue were offset in part by net hedging losses from our cash flow hedging program of $18 million.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of revenue by geography.Cost of Revenue(dollars in millions)202120202019% Change2021-2020Subscription$1,374 $1,108 $926 24 %Percentage of total revenue9 %9 %8 % Product41 36 40 14 %Percentage of total revenue*** Services and other450 578 707 (22)%Percentage of total revenue3 %4 %6 % Total cost of revenue$1,865 $1,722 $1,673 8 %_________________________________________(*) Percentage is less than 1%SubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party hosting services and data center costs, including expenses related to operating our network infrastructure.

Cost of services and other also includes media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory sources for our transaction-based Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings. Cost of services and other decreased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 mainly due to lower media costs related to Advertising Cloud offerings that were discontinued beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.Operating Expenses(dollars in millions)202120202019% Change2021-2020Research and development$2,540 $2,188 $1,930 16 %Percentage of total revenue16 %17 %17 % Sales and marketing4,321 3,591 3,244 20 %Percentage of total revenue27 %28 %29 % General and administrative1,085 968 881 12 %Percentage of total revenue7 %8 %8 % Amortization of intangibles172 162 175 6 %Percentage of total revenue1 %1 %2 % Total operating expenses$8,118 $6,909 $6,230 17 %Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and contracted costs associated with software development, third-party hosting services and data center costs, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in development activities.Research and development expenses increased due to the following: Components of% Change2021-2020Incentive compensation, cash and stock-based8 %Base compensation and related benefits associated with headcount6 Professional and consulting fees2 Total change16 %We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced offerings and solutions.

Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1.47Table of ContentsInterest expense decreased during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower average interest rates on our debt instruments that were refinanced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our debt instruments.Investment Gains (Losses), NetInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Other income (expense), net also includes realized gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses.Other income (expense), decreased during fiscal 2021 primarily due to decreases in interest income driven by lower average interest rates and increases in foreign exchange losses.Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes (dollars in millions)202120202019% Change2021-2020Provision for (benefit from) income taxes$883 $(1,084)$254 **Percentage of total revenue6 %(8)%2 % Effective tax rate15 %(26)%8 % _________________________________________(**) Percentage is not meaningful.Our effective tax rate increased by approximately 41 percentage points during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to the non-recurring tax benefits recognized during fiscal 2020 as a result of the change in our corporate tax trading structure, and the corresponding change in geographic mix of international income in fiscal 2021.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we considered all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $335 million as of December 3, 2021, primarily attributable to certain state credits and foreign intangible assets. We are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. The current U.S. tax law subjects the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to U.S. tax and generally allows an exemption from taxation for distributions from foreign subsidiaries.In the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. Treasury and other domestic and foreign governing bodies continue to consider, and in some cases introduce, changes in regulations applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. As regulations are issued, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our provision for (benefit from) income taxes. 48Table of ContentsAccounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $289 million, $201 million and $173 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 3, 2021, November 27, 2020 and November 29, 2019 were recognized, $199 million, $136 million and $116 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.The combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $22 million and $26 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $5 million over the next 12 months.In addition, in the United States and other countries where we conduct business and in jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries, other governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our research and development tax credits, intercompany transfer pricing practices and other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.49Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows This data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.As of(in millions)December 3, 2021November 27, 2020Cash and cash equivalents$3,844 $4,478 Short-term investments$1,954 $1,514 Working capital$1,737 $2,634 Stockholders’ equity$14,797 $13,264 A summary of our cash flows for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:(in millions)202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$7,230 $5,727 $4,422 Net cash used for investing activities(3,537)(414)(456)Net cash used for financing activities(4,301)(3,488)(2,946)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(26)3 (13)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(634)$1,828 $1,007 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. Our primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash include proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2021, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.23 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income together with increases in deferred revenue driven by Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings. The primary working capital use of cash were increases in prepaid expenses and other assets together with increases in trade receivables. The increases in prepaid expenses and other assets were driven by sales commissions paid and capitalized and the timing of billings and payments associated with certain vendors. The increases in trade receivables were attributable to the timing of billings.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2021, net cash used for investing activities of $3.54 billion was primarily due to our acquisition of Workfront, Frame.io and ongoing capital expenditures. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2021, net cash used for financing activities of $4.30 billion was primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, which were offset by proceeds from re-issuance of common stock mainly for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” below.Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2022 due to changes in our planned cash outlay. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the pandemic and other risks detailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.50Table of ContentsOur cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 3, 2021 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. As of December 3, 2021, we expect our capital investment to be approximately $180 million to $220 million, primarily to fund our San Jose and Bangalore construction projects during fiscal 2022. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.Revolving Credit AgreementWe have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (“Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through October 17, 2023. As of December 3, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 3, 2021, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Senior NotesWe have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 3, 2021, the carrying value of our senior notes was $4.12 billion and our maximum commitment for interest payments was $514 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our debt.Contractual ObligationsOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of December 3, 2021, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $1.38 billion. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations.We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. As of December 3, 2021, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $604 million. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our lease obligations.Our transition tax liability related to historical undistributed foreign earnings, which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, was approximately $349 million as of December 3, 2021 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes under current U.S. tax law.Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In May 2018, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $8 billion in our common stock, which we fully utilized during fiscal 2021. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted additional authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $3.95 billion, $3.05 billion and $2.75 billion, respectively. We repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares at an average price of $536.17 per share in fiscal 2021, 8.0 million shares at an average price of $376.38 per share in fiscal 2020, and 9.9 million shares at an average price of $270.23 per share in fiscal 2019. Subsequent to December 3, 2021, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $2.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. The 51Table of Contentsremaining balance will be settled during our third quarter of fiscal 2022. Upon completion of the $2.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $10.7 billion remains under our December 2020 authority.See section titled ""Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" in Part I, Item 5 of this report for stock repurchases during the quarter ended December 3, 2021 and Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our stock repurchase program.IndemnificationsIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows :(in millions)202120202019Euro€2,209 €1,887 €1,603 Japanese Yen¥104,829 ¥88,640 ¥73,158 British Pounds£669 £562 £503 Australian Dollars$768 $645 $538 As of December 3, 2021, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, were $3.03 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.47 billion in Euros, $480 million in British Pounds, $448 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $299 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 3, 2021, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2022. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 3, 2021. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $172 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $76 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the 52Table of Contentslocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $749 million and $598 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At December 3, 2021, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial instruments.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt December 3, 2021, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.95 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 3, 2021, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a $27 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $14 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.Senior NotesAs of December 3, 2021, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 3, 2021, the total carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.12 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $4.29 billion.See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:04:16.938107
796343,ADBE,ADOBE INC.,2023,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, filed with the SEC on January 21, 2022.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.Cloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•expected costs to develop acquired technologies and patents internally into commercially viable products;36Table of Contents•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the acquired company’s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and •discount rates.In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Accounting for Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our current provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our interpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final determination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. ACQUISITIONS In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media reportable segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a workflow platform, for approximately $1.52 billion in cash consideration and we began integrating Workfront into our Digital Experience reportable segment. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of 2022For our fiscal 2022, we experienced strong demand across our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, driven by the ongoing shift towards a digital-first world. As we execute on our long-term growth initiatives, we have continued to experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings.Digital MediaIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences. Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions. Creative Cloud delivers value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and feature enhancements, cloud-enabled services including storage and 37Table of Contentssyncing of files across users’ devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.We offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and products like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.We continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (“ETLAs”), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.We are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, with a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat Sign and Adobe Scan. Adobe Acrobat is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.As part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model (“DDOM”) and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys, and it continues to contribute strong growth in the business.Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:Creative ARRAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services+ Annual Creative ETLA Contract Value Document Cloud ARRAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services +Annual Document Cloud ETLA Contract ValueDigital Media ARRCreative ARR+ Document Cloud ARRIn March 2022, in response to the Russia-Ukraine war, we announced a halt of all new sales of our products and services in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by $75 million, which represented our Digital Media ARR for existing business in Russia and Belarus. While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine. This resulted in a total ARR reduction of $87 million taken at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $11.60 billion, up from $10.22 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2022 was $2.37 billion, up from $1.93 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $13.97 billion at the end of fiscal 2022, up from $12.15 billion at the end of fiscal 2021. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2022 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2023, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2022 would be $13.26 billion or approximately $712 million lower than the ARR reported above.38Table of ContentsOur success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2022 was $10.46 billion, up from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 10% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2022 was $2.38 billion, up from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 21% year-over-year growth. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $12.84 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $11.52 billion in fiscal 2021 and representing 11% year-over-year growth driven by strong net new user growth.Digital ExperienceWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable personalized experiences at scale and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage are strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to integrate our comprehensive set of solutions.Adobe Experience Cloud delivers solutions for our customers across the following strategic growth pillars:•Data insights and audiences. Our solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our Real-time Customer Data Platform, deliver robust customer profiles and AI-powered analytics across the customer journey to provide timely, relevant experiences across platforms.•Content and commerce. Our solutions help customers manage, deliver and optimize content delivery through Adobe Experience Manager, and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses with Adobe Commerce.•Customer journeys. Our solutions help businesses manage, test, target, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases, including through Marketo Engage, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Journey Optimizer. •Marketing workflow. We offer Adobe Workfront, a work management platform directed toward marketers to orchestrate campaign workflows.In addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. Digital Experience revenue was $4.42 billion in fiscal 2022, up from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021 which represents 14% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.88 billion in fiscal 2022 from $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021, representing 15% year-over-year growth.Macroeconomic ConditionsAs a corporation with an extensive global footprint, we are subject to risks and exposures from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to, the Russia-Ukraine war, COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have negatively impacted our revenue and earnings during fiscal 2022, and are expected to continue to negatively impact our financial results in fiscal 2023.While our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of these macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. See the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of these macroeconomic issues on our business.39Table of ContentsFinancial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2022•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $13.97 billion as of December 2, 2022 increased by $1.82 billion, or 15%, from $12.15 billion as of December 3, 2021. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, partially offset by an $87 million ARR reduction taken in March 2022 in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. •Creative revenue of $10.46 billion increased by $913 million, or 10%, during fiscal 2022, from $9.55 billion in fiscal 2021. Document Cloud revenue of $2.38 billion increased by $409 million, or 21%, during fiscal 2022, from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2021. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.•Digital Experience revenue of $4.42 billion increased by $555 million, or 14%, during fiscal 2022, from $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.•Remaining performance obligations of $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022 increased by $1.20 billion, or 9%, from $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. •Cost of revenue of $2.17 billion increased by $300 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2022, from $1.87 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, as well as increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs.•Operating expenses of $9.34 billion increased by $1.23 billion, or 15%, during fiscal 2022, from $8.12 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend.•Cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion during fiscal 2022 increased by $608 million, or 8%, from $7.23 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher net income after adjustment for non-cash items.RevenueRevenue for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.(dollars in millions)202220212020% Change2022-2021Subscription$16,388 $14,573 $11,626 12 %Percentage of total revenue93 %92 %90 % Product532 555 507 (4)%Percentage of total revenue3 %4 %4 % Services and other686 657 735 4 %Percentage of total revenue4 %4 %6 % Total revenue$17,606 $15,785 $12,868 12 %SubscriptionOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings, and related support, including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services.

These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.Segments In fiscal 2022, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:•Digital Media—Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.

Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 were impacts associated with foreign currency which were mitigated in part by our foreign currency hedging program. During fiscal 2022, the U.S. Dollar primarily strengthened against EMEA and APAC foreign currencies as compared to fiscal 2021, which decreased revenue in U.S. Dollar equivalents by approximately $486 million. During fiscal 2022, the foreign currency impacts to revenue were offset in part by net hedging gains from our cash flow hedging program of $176 million.See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of revenue by geography.Cost of Revenue(dollars in millions)202220212020% Change2022-2021Subscription$1,646 $1,374 $1,108 20 %Percentage of total revenue9 %9 %9 % Product35 41 36 (15)%Percentage of total revenue*** Services and other484 450 578 8 %Percentage of total revenue3 %3 %4 % Total cost of revenue$2,165 $1,865 $1,722 16 %_________________________________________(*) Percentage is less than 1%42Table of ContentsSubscriptionCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party hosting services and data center costs, including expenses related to operating our network infrastructure.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized based on evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence. On the basis of this evaluation, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount realizable. The total valuation allowance was $402 million as of December 2, 2022, primarily related to certain state credits. 45Table of ContentsWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions. The current U.S. tax law subjects the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to U.S. tax and generally allows an exemption from taxation for distributions from foreign subsidiaries.In the current global tax policy environment, the domestic and foreign governing bodies continue to consider, and in some cases introduce, changes in regulations applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. As regulations are issued, we account for finalized regulations in the period of enactment. See Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income TaxesThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $321 million, $289 million and $201 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the respective effective tax rates.As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although the timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.Our future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.In addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those covered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, could make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. These countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some cases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been interpreted and applied. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to respond by making changes to our business structure, or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.Moreover, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. Our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; however, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.46Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Flows This data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.As of(in millions)December 2, 2022December 3, 2021Cash and cash equivalents$4,236 $3,844 Short-term investments$1,860 $1,954 Working capital$868 $1,737 Stockholders’ equity$14,051 $14,797 A summary of our cash flows for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:(in millions)202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$7,838 $7,230 $5,727 Net cash used for investing activities(570)(3,537)(414)Net cash used for financing activities(6,825)(4,301)(3,488)Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(51)(26)3 Net change in cash and cash equivalents$392 $(634)$1,828 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. Our primary uses of cash are our stock repurchase program as described below and general business expenses including payroll, marketing and third-party hosting services. Other sources of cash include proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.84 billion was primarily comprised of net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in deferred revenue driven by Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, partially offset by increases in trade receivables attributable to the timing of billings.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2022, net cash used for investing activities of $570 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures and business acquisitions. See Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $6.83 billion was primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, offset in part by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock mainly for our employee stock purchase plan. See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” below.Liquidity and Capital Resources ConsiderationsOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2023 due to changes in our planned cash outlay. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks detailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022 consisted of asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits, U.S. agency 47Table of Contentssecurities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. (“Figma”) for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma’s Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. We expect to finance the cash portion of the consideration using cash on hand and short-term debt instruments. While the transaction is pending, at a minimum we expect to maintain share repurchases sufficient to offset the dilution of equity issuances to our employees. Revolving Credit AgreementDuring 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for a five-year $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility through June 30, 2027, which replaces our previous five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of October 17, 2018. Subject to the agreement of lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. As of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1.5 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.Senior NotesWe have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and our maximum commitment for interest payments was $416 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our debt.During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2023 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the related discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.Contractual ObligationsOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. As of December 2, 2022, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $6.09 billion, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our purchase obligations.We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032. As of December 2, 2022, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $548 million. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our lease obligations.OtherOur transition tax liability related to historical undistributed foreign earnings, which was accrued as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, was approximately $313 million as of December 2, 2022 and is payable in installments through fiscal 2026. As we repatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes. In addition, the U.S. Tax Act requires companies to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures starting fiscal 2023. If not modified, we anticipate an adverse impact to our effective rates for income taxes paid, which will be partially offset by the increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, for fiscal 2023 and beyond.48Table of ContentsThe Inflation Reduction Act enacted on August 16, 2022 introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions to our results of operations and cash flows.Stock Repurchase ProgramTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.During fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, as well as 5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55 through an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion. As of December 2, 2022, $583 million of prepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase agreement.Subsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. Upon completion of the $1.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under our December 2020 authority.See section titled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5 of this report for stock repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2022 and Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our stock repurchase program.IndemnificationsIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.49Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.Foreign Currency RiskForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging InstrumentsIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:(in millions)202220212020Euro€2,487 €2,209 €1,887 Japanese Yen¥118,456 ¥104,829 ¥88,640 British Pounds£737 £669 £562 Australian Dollars$876 $768 $645 As of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, were $3.25 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in Indian Rupees, $480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 2, 2022, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through November 2023. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2022. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and ExpensesWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or 50Table of Contentsoperating expenses, as applicable. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue or operating expenses, as applicable. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2022, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue or operating expenses relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and LiabilitiesOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At December 2, 2022, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial instruments.Interest Rate RiskShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income SecuritiesAt December 2, 2022, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.86 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a $20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.Senior NotesAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the total carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $3.88 billion.See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:04:07.856462

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated (""Adobe"") is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. We offer a market-leading line of application software products, type products, and content for creating, distributing, and managing information of all types. We license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, value-added resellers (""VARs""), systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturer (""OEM"") partners; direct to end users through Adobe call centers; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA""); and Asia. Revenue 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Revenue $ 1,266.4 25 % $ 1,015.4 13 % $ 894.8 Revenue is categorized into four major operating segments: Web Publishing, Cross-media Publishing, ePaper Solutions, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Web Publishing, Cross-media Publishing, and ePaper Solutions segments include application products revenue that is derived predominantly from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail, VAR, and OEM distribution channels, as well as direct to end users through Adobe call centers and our Web site. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes licensing revenue, which is made up of royalties received from OEM partners who ship products containing Adobe's PostScript technology, and includes revenue from divested businesses. Revenue from our Web Publishing segment is derived primarily from the licensing of the following application products: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, After Effects, GoLive, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, Adobe Web Collection, Adobe Dynamic Media Collection, PageMill, LiveMotion (formerly ImageStyler), and ActiveShare. Cross-media Publishing revenue comes primarily from the licensing of the following application products: Adobe Illustrator, PageMaker, InDesign, FrameMaker, Adobe Publishing Collection, Adobe Design Collection, Adobe Type Manager, Adobe Type Library, PressReady, Adobe Font Folio, InCopy, Acrobat InProduction, Adobe Dimensions, and Streamline. The ePaper Solutions segment is derived from the licensing of Adobe Acrobat software and other Acrobat related technologies. 20 For further information regarding our operating segments, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2000, overall revenue increased 25% compared to fiscal 1999, driven primarily by increased licensing of products in our Web Publishing, ePaper Solutions, and Cross-media Publishing segments. Our Web Publishing segment provided the majority of the revenue growth in fiscal 2000, as it grew 36% from $394.1 million in fiscal 1999 to $536.6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in revenue from this segment was primarily driven by the strength of Photoshop 5.5 revenue during the first three quarters of fiscal 2000 and the release of our Photoshop 6.0 product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. Also contributing to the growth in this segment in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was the increased revenue from our Web and Dynamic Media Collection products, which were first introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, and increased licensing of our LiveMotion, Adobe Premiere, After Effects, GoLive, and ActiveShare products. The increase in revenue in this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our PageMill and PhotoDeluxe products, due to product lifecycle timing and pricing. Revenue from our ePaper Solutions segment increased 61% from $129.3 million in fiscal 1999 to $207.8 million in fiscal 2000 due to the continuing penetration of Acrobat and its related technologies into major industry sectors and various government agencies. Revenue from our Cross-media Publishing segment increased 10% from $353.9 million in fiscal 1999 to $390.5 million in fiscal 2000. This $36.6 million increase was primarily due to the new release of Illustrator 9.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2000. This segment also benefited from the new release of FrameMaker 6.0 in the second quarter of fiscal 2000, as well as increased revenue from our Adobe Design Collection, Adobe Type Manager, Acrobat InProduction, and PressReady products. The increase in revenue from this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our Adobe Publishing Collection product, primarily due to the introduction of our new Adobe Web, Dynamic Media, and Design Collection products, and a decline in revenue in both InDesign, due to slower adoption of this product in fiscal 2000 compared to the adoption upon the initial release of this product in fiscal 1999, and PageMaker, due to product lifecycle timing. The increase in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was partially offset by a 5% decline in revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment, as it decreased from $138.2 million in fiscal 1999 to $131.5 million in fiscal 2000. Revenue from this segment decreased in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 due to lower royalty rates paid by our OEMs and the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors: loss of royalty revenue from Hewlett-Packard Company's (""HP"") desktop monochrome laser printer division, which has been incorporating a clone version of Adobe PostScript software into its products since the fall of 1997; a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers; and an increase in the use of inkjet printers, resulting in weakness in the monochrome laser printer market. Although we experienced better-than-expected results in fiscal 2000 due to the strength of the high-end color and digital copier markets, we expect our OEM PostScript license business to decline approximately 10% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. During fiscal 1999, overall revenue increased 13% compared to fiscal 1998, due to increased licensing of products in the Cross-media Publishing, ePaper Solutions, and Web Publishing segments. Excluding revenue from businesses divested in the third quarter of fiscal 1998, revenue increased 16%. The Cross-media Publishing segment provided the majority of the fiscal 1999 revenue growth, with a 30% increase from $272.2 million in fiscal 1998 to $353.9 million in fiscal 1999. The increase in revenue from this segment was primarily due to increased licensing of our Adobe Publishing Collection product and the introduction of InDesign in the second half of fiscal 1999. The increase in revenue from these products was partially offset by a decline in revenue from PageMaker, Illustrator, and FrameMaker, primarily due to product lifecycle timing. 21 Additional revenue growth in fiscal 1999 was achieved through our ePaper Solutions segment, as revenue more than doubled compared to fiscal 1998, from $58.0 million in fiscal 1998 to $129.3 million in fiscal 1999. This increase was due to the release of Acrobat 4.0 in the second quarter of fiscal 1999, with a higher number of units licensed as a result of growing customer adoption of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Portable Document Format (""PDF"") technology. The Web Publishing segment also contributed to the revenue growth, as it grew 11% in fiscal 1999 to $394.1 million compared to $354.2 million in fiscal 1998. The increase was primarily due to the new release of our GoLive product and increased licensing of our Photoshop, After Effects, and Adobe Premiere products. In addition, this segment experienced increased revenue from our Adobe Web Collection and Adobe Dynamic Media Collection products. The increase in revenue from this segment in fiscal 1999 was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our Adobe PhotoDeluxe product, due to reduced pricing, and a decline in revenue from our PageMill product, due to product lifecycle timing. The increase in revenue in fiscal 1999 in the above operating segments was partially offset by a decline in revenue from the OEM PostScript and Other segment of $72.2 million, or 34%, compared to fiscal 1998. OEM PostScript licensing revenue experienced a decline in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, primarily due to the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors: loss of royalty revenue from HP's desktop monochrome laser printer division, which has been incorporating a clone version of Adobe PostScript software into its products since the fall of 1997; a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers; and an increase in the use of inkjet printers, resulting in weakness in the monochrome laser printer market. In addition, in fiscal 1998, we received $20.2 million in revenue in this segment from businesses we divested in the third quarter of fiscal 1998, resulting in a decline of revenue in fiscal 1999 from the absence of these businesses. We categorize our geographic information into three major market regions: the Americas, EMEA, and Asia. In fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, revenue generated in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia represented 52%, 26%, and 22% of total revenue, respectively. Overall, revenue from our application products on the Windows platform increased 39% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, and revenue from our application products on the Macintosh platform increased by 15% in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999. In fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, revenue from our application products on the Windows platform increased 22%, and revenue from our application products on the Macintosh platform increased 21% during the same period. In fiscal 2000, the Windows and Macintosh platforms accounted for 63% and 37%, respectively, of application products revenue, excluding platform-independent and UNIX products, compared to 58% and 42%, respectively, in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998. We expect the trend towards the Windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future. Direct Costs 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Direct costs $ 87.3 (8 )% $ 94.5 (6 )% $ 101.0 Percentage of total revenue 6.9 % 9.3 % 11.3 % Direct costs include product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, and amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies. Direct costs decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to lower localization and royalty costs, as well as a reduction in material costs as a result of our ongoing cost improvement program. Direct costs also decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, primarily due to more effective inventory management, resulting in lower excess and obsolete inventory and lower material costs. For fiscal 2001, we anticipate that gross margin will be approximately 93% of revenue. 22 Operating Expenses Research and Development 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Research and development $ 240.2 22 % $ 197.5 5 % $ 188.3 Percentage of total revenue 19.0 % 19.4 % 21.0 % Research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses increased $42.7 million, or 22%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 and higher salaries as a result of headcount growth. Research and development expenses increased $9.2 million, or 5%, in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, due to higher incentive compensation expenses. This increase was partially offset by a decline in salaries as a result of lower headcount and decreases in general office expenses and professional fees as a result of our fiscal 1998 restructuring program and other cost reduction efforts implemented at that time. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to make significant investments in the development of our application software products, including those targeted for the growing Internet market. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2001. We are targeting research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to be 18% of revenue. For the remainder of fiscal 2001, we are targeting research and development expenses to be 19% of revenue. Sales and Marketing 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Sales and marketing $ 401.2 22 % $ 328.5 4 % $ 315.5 Percentage of total revenue 31.7 % 32.3 % 35.3 % Sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits, sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support, and distribution personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations, and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $72.7 million, or 22%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses and higher outsourced technical support and order management fees. In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 due to our focus on general corporate brand advertising, as well as higher marketing, public relations, and trade show activities associated with new product releases. Sales and marketing expenses increased $13.0 million, or 4%, in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 as a result of higher incentive compensation, advertising, promotional, and trade show expenses. The increase was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented during the third quarter of fiscal 1998 that eliminated certain brand advertising campaigns and other marketing activities related to a divested business. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2001 to support investments in e-business and enhanced marketing activities. For the first quarter of fiscal 2001, our sales 23 and marketing expense target is approximately 34% of revenue. For the remainder of fiscal 2001, we are targeting sales and marketing expenses to be approximately 33% of revenue. General and Administrative 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 General and administrative $ 116.5 12 % $ 103.6 (13 )% $ 118.6 Percentage of total revenue 9.2 % 10.2 % 13.3 % General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for the finance, human resources, legal, information services, and executive personnel of Adobe. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses increased $13.0 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to higher salaries as a result of increased headcount, and higher bad debt expense and legal fees. The increase was partially offset by decreases in professional fees and depreciation expense. General and administrative expenses decreased $15.0 million, or 13%, in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, reflecting the savings related to the restructuring programs implemented in fiscal 1999 and 1998. Additionally, the decrease is attributable to decreased legal fees and lower bad debt expense. These decreases were offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense primarily associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal 1999 over the prior year and higher incentive compensation targets. We expect that general and administrative spending will slightly increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2001 to support ongoing administrative infrastructure needs. We have targeted such expenditures to be approximately 9% of revenue in fiscal 2001. Restructuring and Other Charges 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Restructuring and other charges $ 5.6 (76 )% $ 23.0 (40 )% $ 38.2 Percentage of total revenue 0.4 % 2.3 % 4.3 % In fiscal 2000, restructuring and other charges consisted of $6.3 million of other charges relating to the disposal of certain equipment and one-time litigation related expenses, and a credit of $0.7 million related to the fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 restructuring programs. The $0.7 million credit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, as we revised our estimates of the total costs associated with the fiscal 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs. The credit primarily reflected lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within Adobe. The remaining credit was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities. (For detailed information, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). During fiscal 1999 and 1998, we implemented three different Board-approved restructuring programs. These separate restructuring programs were directly focused on improving our competitive position as well as enhancing Adobe's allocation of resources. The two fiscal 1999 restructuring programs resulted in total charges of approximately $19.7 million, which included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and charges for vacating leased facilities. During fiscal 1999, we revised our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring programs implemented during the year, resulting in an adjustment to the restructuring 24 accrual of approximately $3.2 million. The adjustment was due to lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within Adobe, and to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities. In addition, we recorded adjustments during fiscal 1999 related to prior year restructuring programs in the amount of $1.9 million. The $1.9 million adjustment was primarily due to both our success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified and the expiration of other lease termination costs for two facilities. Other charges recorded in fiscal 1999 of $8.4 million included $2.0 million associated with the cancelation of a contract and $2.2 million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program. Additionally, we incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling $2.6 million for a terminated employee and incurred consulting fees of $1.6 million to assist in the restructuring of our operations. The 1998 restructuring program was implemented to refocus our product development efforts and to eliminate management redundancies in the organization. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded $38.2 million in restructuring charges, related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force, as well as the divestiture of two business units, charges for vacating leased facilities, and the cancelation of certain contracts. As of December 1, 2000 no obligations existed related to the fiscal 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs. Acquired In-Process Research and Development 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Acquired in-process research and development $ 0.5 (87 )% $ 3.6 NA $ — Percentage of total revenue — % 0.4 % — % In fiscal 2000, we recorded $0.5 million of acquired in-process research and development related to our acquisition of Glassbook, Inc. (""Glassbook""). The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 (""APB 16""). Based on an independent appraiser's valuation, $0.5 million of the total $28.0 million purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development due to the state of the development and the uncertainty of the technology. Acquired in-process research and development of $3.6 million in fiscal 1999 is comprised of $3.0 million and $0.6 million associated with the acquisitions of Attitude Software, LLC (""Attitude Software"") and Photomerge Technology (""Photomerge""), respectively. The following is a summary of the projects acquired in the acquisitions and the assumptions used in determining the value of the in-process research and development costs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired substantially all of the assets, consisting of intellectual property, of Attitude Software. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with APB 16, and substantially all of the purchase price of $3.0 million cash was allocated to in-process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition. The ongoing project at Attitude Software at the time of the purchase included the development of the 3D Anarchy authoring product. We purchased this technology to incorporate it into future versions of our existing Adobe products to further enhance the feature sets and user interface contained within the products. At the date we acquired Attitude Software, it was estimated that 50% of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining 50% of the development effort would take approximately 18 months to complete and would cost $1.8 million. The efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily related to additional design efforts to integrate the technology into several of 25 Adobe's products, finalization of coding, and completion testing. The value of the in-process technology was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products the technology would be integrated into, including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products, excluding the value attributed to the existing technology with the products prior to the integration of the purchased technology. These cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of 20%, exclusive of the value attributable to the use of the in-process technologies in future products. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired substantially all of the assets, consisting of intellectual property, of Photomerge. In connection with the acquisition of Photomerge, 100% of the purchase price, or $600,000 cash, was allocated to in-process research and development due to the state of completion and the uncertainty of the technology. Amortization of Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles $ 7.0 45 % $ 4.8 (38 )% $ 7.7 Percentage of total revenue 0.6 % 0.5 % 0.9 % Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in fiscal 2000 and 1999 primarily related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of GoLive Systems, Inc. and a related partnership (together ""GoLive Systems"") in December 1998. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was higher in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 primarily due to the additional amortization related to the acquisition of Glassbook in September 2000. (For further information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Nonoperating Income Investment Gain 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Investment gain $ 14.3 (84 )% $ 88.9 493 % $ 15.0 Percentage of total revenue 1.1 % 8.8 % 1.7 % Investment gain consists principally of realized gains or losses from direct investments as well as mark-to-market valuation adjustments for investments held by Adobe Incentive Partners, L.P. (""AIP""). During fiscal 2000, we recorded investment gains related to the sale of a portion of our investment in Tumbleweed Communications Corp. (""Tumbleweed"") and Digimarc Corporation for $10.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded investment gains related to the mark-to-market valuation adjustment for AvantGo, Inc. totaling $13.0 million and other net gains related to various other Adobe Ventures investments activities totaling approximately $15.0 million. These gains were partially offset by investment losses related to the write-down of our investments in Engage, Inc.; eCircles, Inc.; Salon.com; and Impresse Corporation, totaling approximately $26.3 million. In fiscal 1999, we recorded a realized gain of $58.4 million related to the sale of our investment in Vignette Corporation. We also recorded investment gains from mark-to-market adjustments totaling $17.8 million, $10.4 million, and $7.0 million related to investments in ESPS, Inc.; DigitalThink, Inc.; and Tumbleweed, respectively. These gains were partially offset by an investment loss of $5.2 million related to the acquisition of PointCast, Inc., a former investee of Adobe, by idealab!'s Launchpad Technologies, Inc. (""idealab!""). In connection with the acquisition, we exchanged our shares of PointCast, Inc. for approximately 542,000 shares of idealab! (which has since become InfoGate, Inc.). Additionally, we 26 recorded a net gain totaling $0.5 million related to mark-to-market adjustments of various other Adobe Ventures investments. In fiscal 1998, we recorded a realized gain of $6.7 million related to our investment in McQueen International Limited (""McQueen""), due to the acquisition of McQueen by Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated, a publicly traded company. In addition, we liquidated our investment in Siebel Systems, Incorporated (""Siebel"") through the distribution to our stockholders of approximately 165,000 shares of Siebel common stock as a dividend-in-kind and the sale of our remaining Siebel shares. A gain of approximately $5.7 million was recognized on the transaction. The remaining net realized gain recorded in fiscal 1998 represents valuation adjustments related to our venture investments held by AIP. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies. Interest and Other Income 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Interest and other income $ 21.3 (17 )% $ 25.7 (6 )% $ 27.4 Percentage of total revenue 1.7 % 2.5 % 3.1 % Interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and realized gains or losses on the disposal of assets. Interest and other income decreased $4.4 million, or 17%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 as a result of more investments being made in tax-exempt securities, resulting in lower interest income on a comparative pretax basis. In fiscal 2000, we also recorded foreign exchange transaction losses compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in fiscal 1999. In addition, other income was lower in fiscal 2000, as fiscal 1999 included a $5.7 million gain related to the sale of a corporate facility in Edinburgh, Scotland, in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal 1999. The decrease in interest and other income in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998 was primarily due to lower average cash and short-term investment balances, primarily as a result of cash used for stock repurchases. In addition, during fiscal 1999 more investments were made in tax-exempt securities. The decrease in interest and other income in fiscal 1999 was partially offset by a $5.7 million gain realized from the sale of a corporate facility in Edinburgh, Scotland, in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal 1999. We expect interest and other income to be approximately $5.0 million per quarter in fiscal 2001. We expect interest income to increase slightly in fiscal 2001, even though we plan to continue to repurchase stock under our share repurchase program. However, we believe that the increase in interest income may be offset by foreign currency charges for purchased options and market price volatility under our implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (""SFAS 133""), ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."" Further, our cash balances could also be reduced in fiscal 2001 due to the purchase of software companies, products, or technologies that are complementary to our business. Income Tax Provision 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Income tax provision $ 155.9 14 % $ 136.7 119 % $ 62.6 Percentage of total revenue 12.3 % 13.5 % 7.0 % Effective tax rate 35.1 % 36.5 % 37.3 % 27 Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999, due to tax benefits associated with the restructuring of our international operations. Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible goodwill amortization. We have targeted our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2001 to approximately 34%. Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations We believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors, including: •delays in shipment of our new products and major new versions of existing products •lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades •adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business, including the recent slow-down affecting the U.S. and other geographic areas •introduction of new products by major competitors •weakness in demand for application software and printers •lack of growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and downward sales price adjustments •renegotiation of royalty arrangements •consolidation in the OEM printer business •ongoing weakness in our printing business due to product transitions •industry transitions to new business and information delivery models •market risks associated with our equity investments (as discussed later under ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"") We have stated that we are targeting at least 25% annual revenue growth in fiscal 2001. Additionally, for fiscal 2001 we have stated the following operating model targets: gross margin of 93%, operating profit margin of 32%, and general and administrative expenses at 9% of revenue. For the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we have stated operating model targets for research and development expenses of 18% of revenue and sales and marketing expenses of 34% of revenue; and for the remainder of fiscal 2001, research and development expenses of 19% of revenue and sales and marketing expenses of 33% of revenue. We have also stated that we expect our share count to increase three to four million per quarter in fiscal 2001, that interest income is expected to be approximately $5.0 million per quarter in fiscal 2001, and that we plan to hire 1,000 employees in fiscal 2001. However, our headcount increases will not reach this initially planned level due to adjustments in light of the recent slow-down in some geographic areas. Finally, we have stated an effective tax rate target for fiscal 2001 of 34% and a days sales outstanding (""DSO"") target range of 40-45 days. We use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments, not as predictions of future results. The targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions about: •product pricing and demand •manufacturing costs and volumes •the mix of application products and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, distribution channels, and geographic distribution •substantial headcount increases 28 These and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results, including results for the current quarter, to vary materially from these targets. In particular, the recent slow-down in some geographic areas, primarily in the U.S., has affected all of our product segments and may adversely affect our ability to achieve our revenue target. The slow-down has also affected our hiring plans; we may hire significantly fewer than 1,000 employees during fiscal 2001 in light of this factor. Our ability to develop and market products, including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may also have an impact on our results of operations. Our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products. A portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings, or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations. The market for our graphics applications, particularly our Web publishing and consumer products, is intensely and increasingly competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors. Additionally, Microsoft has increased its presence in the digital imaging/graphics market; we believe that, due to Microsoft's market dominance, any new Microsoft digital imaging products will be highly competitive with our products. If competing new products achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results would suffer. We generally offer our application-based products on Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX platforms, and we generally offer our server-based products on the Linux platform as well as these three platforms. To the extent that there is a slow-down of customer purchases of personal computers on either the Windows or Macintosh platform or in general, our business could be harmed. We distribute our application products primarily through distributors, resellers, and retailers (collectively referred to as ""distributors""). A significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors. We have revised our channel program to reduce the overall number of our distributors worldwide and focus our channel efforts on larger distributors. This revision of the channel program has resulted in an increase in our dependence on a smaller number of distributors selling through a larger amount of our products. Additionally, our goal is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our Web site at www.adobe.com. Any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online, Internet-based resellers of our products. While we anticipate that the restructuring and streamlining of our product distribution channels and the increase in the scope of our direct sales efforts will eventually improve our business by decreasing discounts or rebate programs provided to distributors, decreasing product returns, and shortening inventory cycles, these changes could instead seriously harm our business. In addition, we continue to expand into third-party distribution channels, including VARs and systems integrators, in our effort to further broaden our customer base. As a result, the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success. Some of these companies are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions. Our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate. Also, as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the corporate business and consumer markets, we may not successfully adapt our application software distribution channels, which could cause our operating results to suffer. We could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business. We currently rely on three manufacturers of our products, each located in a different region. If a manufacturer terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a manufacturer is interrupted or 29 terminated for any other reason, we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that manufacturer to avoid harm to our business. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment experienced a 5% decline in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily as a result of a decline in revenue from the licensing of Adobe PostScript technology. We expect this trend to continue, with this revenue declining a further 10% during fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000, and we believe that our financial results could be harmed if it decreases further. The ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the decline in average selling prices of monochrome laser printers and the increasing use of inkjet printers was a factor causing the revenue decline. In addition, the loss of royalty revenue from HP's desktop monochrome laser printer division, which has been incorporating a clone version of Adobe PostScript technology in some printers, has resulted in lower licensing revenue to us over the past three years. Even though we continue to work with HP printer operations to incorporate Adobe PostScript and other technologies into other HP products, we expect continued lower revenue in this segment from HP. If other significant partners also decide to incorporate a clone version instead of Adobe PostScript technology, it could seriously harm our business. Further, OEM partners on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements. We evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for us. We are currently experiencing a slow-down in certain geographic market areas, primarily in the U.S. We attribute this slow-down, which is affecting all of our product segments, to weakening economic conditions. In addition, from the end of fiscal 1997 through the first quarter of fiscal 1999, we experienced a decline in revenue from the Japanese market due to a weak Japanese computer market and general economic conditions in Japan. Although revenue from our Japanese operation has increased since that time, these adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other geographic markets may continue in the short term, and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings. Although there were also adverse conditions in other countries, the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results. Although we implemented two restructurings of our business during fiscal 1999, resulting in a collective workforce reduction of 9%, we plan to continue to invest in certain areas, which will require us to hire a significant number of additional employees. Competition for high-quality personnel, especially highly skilled engineers, is extremely intense. Our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems, and to attract, retain, motivate, and manage employees effectively; otherwise our business could be seriously harmed. The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the Internet. As is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The software industry addressing authoring and communications over the Internet is still developing. Standards defining Web graphics have not yet been finally adopted. In addition, new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices. Moreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use and access, cost, and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect the growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets. We have stated that we intend to increase our investment in e-business and enhanced marketing activities in an effort to achieve revenue growth, but we can provide no assurance that increased investment in this new market will result in increased revenue. We derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our customers located in Europe, Japan, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. We generally experience lower revenue from our 30 European operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months. Additionally, we are uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in the Asia Pacific and Latin America markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions. While most of the revenue of our European subsidiaries has in the past been denominated in U.S. dollars, in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 we began to denominate revenue in euros in certain European countries. In addition, the majority of our revenue derived from Japan is denominated in yen, and the majority of all our subsidiaries' operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies. As a result, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the financial impact of such fluctuations has not been significant. Our hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks, based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. We have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily of the Japanese yen and the euro. We are currently reviewing our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our best judgment. Our hedging program is not comprehensive, and our program may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates. In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party rights, we have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to complex, protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation. Adverse decisions in such litigation could have negative results, including subjecting us to significant liabilities, requiring us to seek licenses from others, preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, any one of which could seriously harm our business. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ""AICPA""), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business, including: •rules relating to software revenue recognition •purchase and pooling-of-interests accounting for business combinations •the valuation of in-process research and development •employee stock purchase plans •stock option grants •goodwill amortization have recently been revised or are under review by one or more of these groups. Changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business. Due to the factors noted earlier, our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings, or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade, compared to analysts' or investors' expectations could cause, and has caused in the past, an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even more 31 immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock. Finally, we participate in a highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to us, changes in analysts' earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment, our industry, or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB"") implemented SFAS 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"", as amended by SFAS 137, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133,"" and SFAS 138, ""Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities."" We adopted SFAS 133 beginning December 2, 2000. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. The adoption of SFAS 133 is not expected to result in any material transition adjustment to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (""SAB 101""), ""Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."" SAB 101 summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to revenue recognition in financial statements. In March 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101A, which delayed the implementation date of SAB No. 101. In June 2000, the SEC issued SAB 101B, which further delayed the implementation date of SAB 101. We adopted SAB 101 beginning December 2, 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In March 2000, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 44 (""FIN 44""). ""Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation—an Interpretation of APB No. 25."" FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB 25 for certain issues including: (a) the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB 25, (b) the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 was effective July 1, 2000, except for the provisions that relate to modifications that directly or indirectly reduce the exercise price of an award and the definition of an employee, which were effective after December 15, 1998. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (the ""EITF"") published its consensus on Issue No. 00-2, ""Accounting for Web Site Development Costs,"" which requires that costs incurred during the development of Web site applications and infrastructure, involving developing software to operate the Web site, including graphics that affect the ""look and feel"" of the Web page and all costs relating to software used to operate a Web site, should be accounted for under Statement of Position 98-1 (""SOP 98-1""), ""Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use."" However, if a plan exists or is being developed to market the software externally, the costs relating to the software should be accounted for pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 (""SFAS 86""), ""Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed."" We adopted Issue No. 00-2 in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The adoption of Issue No. 00-2 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In March 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-3, ""Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entity's Hardware."" The Issue states that a software element covered by Statement of Position 97-2 (""SOP 97-2"") is only present in a hosting arrangement if the customer has the contractual 32 right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. We do not expect the adoption of Issue No. 00-3 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In March 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-8, ""Accounting by a Grantee for an Equity Instrument to Be Received in Conjunction with Providing Goods or Services."" Issue No. 00-8 addresses the date to be used by the grantee to measure the fair value of those equity instruments for revenue recognition purposes for transactions in which an entity provides goods or services in exchange for equity instruments. In addition, it addresses how the grantee should account for an increase in fair value as a result of an adjustment as revenue for transactions in which any of the terms of the equity instruments are subject to adjustment after the measurement date. Issue No. 00-8 applies to all grants and to modifications of existing grants that occur after March 16, 2000. The adoption of Issue No. 00-8 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In May 2000, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-14, ""Accounting for Coupons, Rebates, and Discounts."" Issue No. 00-14 addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement classification for sales incentives offered voluntarily by a vendor without charge to customers that can be used in, or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of, a single exchange transaction. We adopted Issue No. 00-14 beginning December 2, 2000. The adoption of Issue No. 00-14 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 33 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2000 Change 1999 Change 1998 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ 679.9 36 % $ 498.7 83 % $ 272.5 Working capital $ 563.3 59 % $ 355.4 73 % $ 205.0 Stockholders' equity $ 752.5 47 % $ 512.2 (1 )% $ 516.4 Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consist principally of money market mutual funds, municipal bonds, United States government agency securities, and marketable equity securities. All of our cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale under the provisions of SFAS 115, ""Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."" The securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased $181.1 million, or 36%, in fiscal 2000, primarily due to cash generated from operations of $444.6 million and proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $119.1 million. Other sources of cash include the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the sale of a building in the amounts of $17.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. In addition, short-term investments increased due to a reclassification of $73.3 million of investments previously classified as long-term to short-term. These increases were partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock in the amount of $255.5 million, the purchase of long-term investments and other assets for $59.1 million, the purchase of Glassbook for $24.4 million, capital expenditures of $29.8 million, and the payment of dividends totaling $12.0 million. In addition, our short-term investments decreased as a result of mark-to-market adjustments totaling $74.2 million, the write-down of certain short-term marketable equity investments totaling $18.4 million, and the sale of marketable equity investments with a cost basis of $5.1 million. We expect to continue our investing activities, including expenditures for computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to purchase treasury stock and acquire software companies, products, or technologies that are complementary to our business. Under our existing plan to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans, we repurchased approximately 7.2 million, 22.4 million, and 1.4 million shares in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, at a cost of $255.5 million, $448.7 million, and $16.8 million, respectively. In April 1999, Adobe's Board of Directors authorized, subject to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period. This new stock repurchase program was in addition to an existing program whereby we have been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans. No purchases have been made under the 5.0 million share repurchase program. In September 1997, Adobe's Board of Directors authorized, subject to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to 60.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period. This program was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Under this program, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares in fiscal 1999, 40.7 million shares in fiscal 1998, and 16.0 million shares in fiscal 1997, at a cost of $30.5 million, $362.4 million, and $188.6 million, respectively. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of fiscal 1988. Adobe's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0125 per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998. The declaration of future dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of Adobe's Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, and other factors. 34 To facilitate our stock repurchase program, we sold put warrants in a series of private placements in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998. Each put warrant entitles the holder to sell one share of our common stock to us at a specified price. Approximately 8.6 million, 12.0 million, and 16.0 million put warrants were written in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. At December 1, 2000, approximately 2.9 million put warrants were outstanding that expire on various dates through July 2001 and have exercise prices ranging from $58.83 to $67.53 per share, with an average exercise price of $62.45 per share. In addition, in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, we purchased call options that entitle us to buy 5.1 million, 5.8 million, and 6.4 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. At December 1, 2000, approximately 1.8 million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through April 2001 and have exercise prices ranging from $63.60 to $73.00 per share, with an average exercise price of $67.51 per share. Our put and call option contracts provide that we, at our option, can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the option as determined by the contract. We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future. Commitments Our principal commitments as of December 1, 2000 consisted of obligations under operating leases, line of credit agreements, venture investing activities, and various service agreements. In August 1999, we entered into an operating lease agreement for two corporate headquarters office facilities in San Jose, California. The lease is for a period of five years and is subject to standard covenants including financial ratios. We have an option to purchase the buildings at any time during the term for an amount equal to the total investment of the lessor. At the end of the lease term, we may exercise the purchase option or, with the mutual agreement of the lessor, renew the term of the lease. In addition to these possibilities, at the end of the term, we may elect to have the buildings sold to an unrelated third party. In such case, we are obligated to use our best efforts to arrange for such a sale and are obligated to pay the lessor the difference between the total investment in the buildings and the net sales proceeds, provided, however, that in no event would we be required to pay more than a maximum guaranteed residual amount as set forth in the lease. In the event we default during the term of the lease, the lessor could require us to purchase the buildings for an amount equal to our option price. As of December 1, 2000, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. In August 1999, we entered into a $200.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit with a group of 15 banks for general corporate purposes, subject to certain financial covenants. One-half of the facility expired in August 2000, and the other $100.0 million expires in August 2002. We renewed, for one year, the $100.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit that expired in August 2000. Outstanding balances accrue interest at London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus a margin that is based on our financial ratios. The terms, covenants, and margins of the new facility are substantially the same as the expired facility. There were no outstanding balances on either credit facility as of December 1, 2000. In addition, as of December 1, 2000, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. We believe that if either or both of the lines of credit are canceled or amounts are not available under the lines, it would not substantially harm our financial results, liquidity, or capital resources. Under the terms of the lines of credit and the lease agreement, we may pay cash dividends unless an event of default has occurred or we do not meet certain financial ratios. 35 Derivatives and Financial Instruments (Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in various foreign currencies, primarily in certain European countries and Japan. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen denominated licenses in Japan and local currency denominated operating expenses in Europe, where we license primarily in U.S. dollars. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we began to denominate revenue in euros in certain European countries. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen denominated licenses in Japan. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using primarily forward contracts. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased options. At December 1, 2000, total outstanding contracts included $23.2 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of $43.3 million. All contracts expire at various times through March 2001. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of December 1, 2000. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $5.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Conversely, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $3.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. We recognize gains and losses associated with the mark-to-market of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of existing transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained, as other income in the current period. Corresponding gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated transactions being hedged are recognized as other income in that same period. In this manner, the gains and losses on foreign currency denominated transactions will be offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency contracts. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of these instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we began to denominate revenue in euros in certain European countries. As a rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in Europe where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries the local currency revenue from product upgrades substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge European currency exposure on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of equity securities. As of December 1, 2000, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $90.2 million. We believe that it is 36 reasonably possible that the prices of these securities could experience adverse changes in the near term. For example, as a result of recent market price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments, we experienced a $20.2 million after-tax unrealized gain during the third quarter of fiscal 2000 and a $38.5 million after-tax unrealized loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 on these investments. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate the economic viability of these publicly traded companies, which includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash positions, revenue models, stock price activity over the past six months, and future prospects. If we believe that an other-than-temporary impairment exists in one of our equity investments in these publicly traded companies, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value on the last day of our reporting period. In addition, we have investments in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose a substantial part of or our entire initial investment in these companies. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our public equity investments that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Stock price fluctuations of minus 50%, 35%, and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. Potential decrease to the value of securities given X% decrease in each stock's price (50%) (35%) (15%) Fair Value as of December 1, 2000 Corporate equities $ (45.1 ) $ (31.6 ) $ (13.5 ) $ 90.2 We also have a policy to hedge a certain portion of our equity holdings in publicly traded companies. From time to time, we have entered into forward contracts to sell portions of our equity holdings in future periods. These forward contracts are accounted for at fair market value offsetting changes in the value of the equities being hedged. As of December 1, 2000, the value of our forward contracts hedging equity securities was $10.7 million. An increase (decrease) in the market value of the underlying equities will result in a corresponding decrease (increase) in the value of the forward contract. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of the forward contracts given a percentage change in the underlying equities. Potential decrease to the value of the forward contracts given X% increase in the stock price of the underlying equities 50% 25% Fair Value as of December 1, 2000 Forward contracts $ (2.6 ) $ (1.3 ) $ 10.7 Fixed Income Investments At December 1, 2000, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $368.3 million. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. An increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 1, 2000. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. The market value changes for a 50, 100, or 150-basis point increase in short-term treasury security yields were not material due to the limited duration of our portfolio. 37 We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We do, however, limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time, the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to 2.3 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to one issue, issuer, as well as the type of instrument. Due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines, we do not expect the exposure to market and credit risk to be material. Facility Leases We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases of our facilities whose payments are tied to the LIBOR and have evaluated the hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the LIBOR. Market changes reflected immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the LIBOR curve of plus or minus 50, 100, and 150basis points for a twelve-month period. Based on this analysis, such charges would not be material to our results of operations or financial position.",2023-12-30 17:04:20.962272

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated (""Adobe"") builds award-winning software solutions for network publishing, including Web, ePaper, print, video, wireless and broadband applications. Its graphic design, imaging, dynamic media and authoring tools enable customers to create, manage, and deliver visually-rich, reliable content. We license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, and OEMs; direct to end users through Adobe call centers; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA""); and Asia. Revenue 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Revenue $ 1,229.7 (3 )% $ 1,266.4 25 % $ 1,015.4 Revenue is categorized into four major operating segments: Web Publishing, Cross-media Publishing, ePaper Solutions, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Web Publishing, Cross-media Publishing, and ePaper Solutions segments include application products revenue that is derived predominantly from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail, VAR, and OEM distribution channels, as well as direct to end users through Adobe call centers and our Web site. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes licensing revenue, which is made up of royalties received from OEM customers who ship products containing Adobe's PostScript technology. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, we have realigned our business segments. A newly named Graphics segment will in the future replace the former Web Publishing segment and will include revenues and direct expenses related to Adobe Illustrator. The Adobe GoLive and Web Collection products will be reported in the Cross-media Publishing segment. The management's discussion and analysis that follows is based on our old segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999. For more information on both our old and new segment reporting, please refer to Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Revenue from our Web Publishing segment is derived primarily from the licensing of the following application products: Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, Photoshop Elements, Web Collection, After Effects, AlterCast, GoLive, Digital Video Collection, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, Streamline, Atmosphere, Adobe Dimensions, Adobe Viewer, and LiveMotion. Cross-media Publishing revenue comes primarily from the licensing of the following application products: Illustrator, Design Collection, Adobe Publishing Collection, PageMaker, FrameMaker, Adobe Type products, InDesign, Adobe Acrobat InProduction, Adobe Content Server, Adobe PDF Transit, Adobe Studio, eBooks, and PressReady. The ePaper Solutions segment is derived from the licensing of Adobe Acrobat software and other Acrobat related technologies. During fiscal 2001, overall revenue decreased 3%, or $36.7 million, compared to fiscal 2000, primarily due to adverse economic conditions, especially in the US, and a decline in revenue from our Web Publishing, Cross-media Publishing, and OEM PostScript and Other segments. Revenue from our Web Publishing segment decreased 10%, or $54.1 million, from $536.6 million in fiscal 2000 to $482.5 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease in revenue from this segment was primarily due to severe economic pressure on the creative publishing professional market, which resulted in a decline in revenue from our Photoshop product. Also contributing to the decrease in revenue in this segment in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 were the following factors: decreased revenue from our GoLive and Web Collection products, due to declines in the web layout and web animation products market; decreased revenue from our PhotoDeluxe product due to product lifecycle timing; and decreased revenue from our LiveMotion product due to competitive factors and product lifecycle timing. Our After Effects product also experienced a decline in revenue despite its new version release in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. The decrease in revenue in this segment was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the following products: Photoshop Elements, which was first released in April of fiscal 2001; Digital Video Collection, due to the growth of the digital video market; and Adobe Premiere, due to the new version release of Adobe Premiere 6.0 in January 2001. Revenue from our Cross-media Publishing segment decreased 10%, or $40.0 million, from $390.5 million in fiscal 2000 to $350.5 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease was partially due to a decline in revenue from our Illustrator and Publishing Collections products throughout fiscal year 2001 due to product lifecycle timings, which more than offset the revenue from their new version releases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. There were also decreases in revenue from our FrameMaker and InDesign products, due to product lifecycle timing, and our Type product, due to decreased marketing activities. Lastly, we experienced a decline in revenue from our PageMaker product in the first half of fiscal 2001, which more than offset the revenue from the new version release of PageMaker 7.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2001. The decrease in revenue from this segment was partially offset by an increase in revenue from our Adobe Design Collection product due to increased marketing and promotional activities throughout the year. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased 20%, or $26.7 million, from $131.5 million in fiscal 2000 to $104.8 million in fiscal 2001, due to the following factors: continued weakness in the print business, customer transition from paper-based processes to electronic workflows, renegotiated pricing with certain OEM customers, and the outsourcing of certain OEM accounts to a third party solution provider. The decrease in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was partially offset by an increase of 40%, or $84.1 million, in our ePaper Solutions segment, as it increased from $207.8 million in fiscal 2000 to $291.9 million in fiscal 2001, due to the release of Acrobat 5.0 in the second quarter of fiscal 2001, as well as the continuing movement from paper-based processes to electronic workflows adopted by enterprises and government agencies. During fiscal 2000, overall revenue increased 25% compared to fiscal 1999, driven primarily by increased licensing of products in our Web Publishing, ePaper Solutions, and Cross-media Publishing segments. Our Web Publishing segment provided the majority of the revenue growth in fiscal 2000, as it grew 36% from $394.1 million in fiscal 1999 to $536.6 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in revenue from this segment was primarily driven by the strength of our Photoshop 5.5 product during the first three quarters of fiscal 2000 and the release of our Photoshop 6.0 product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. 24 Also contributing to the growth in this segment in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was the increased revenue from our Web and Dynamic Media Collection products, which were first introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, and increased licensing of our LiveMotion, Adobe Premiere, After Effects, GoLive, and ActiveShare products. The increase in revenue in this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our PageMill and PhotoDeluxe products, due to product lifecycle timing and reduced pricing. Revenue from our ePaper Solutions segment increased 61% from $129.3 million in fiscal 1999 to $207.8 million in fiscal 2000 due to the continuing penetration of Acrobat and its related technologies into major industry sectors and various government agencies. Revenue from our Cross-media Publishing segment increased 10% from $353.9 million in fiscal 1999 to $390.5 million in fiscal 2000. This $36.6 million increase was primarily due to the new release of Illustrator 9.0 in the third quarter of fiscal 2000. This segment also benefited from the new release of FrameMaker 6.0 in the second quarter of fiscal 2000, as well as increased revenue from our Adobe Design Collection, Adobe Type Manager, Acrobat InProduction, and PressReady products. The increase in revenue from this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our Adobe Publishing Collection product, primarily due to the introduction of our new Adobe Web, Dynamic Media, and Design Collection products, and a decline in revenue in both our InDesign product, due to slower adoption of this product in fiscal 2000 compared to the adoption rate upon the initial release of this product in fiscal 1999, and our PageMaker products, due to product lifecycle timing. The increase in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 was partially offset by a 5% decline in revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment, as it decreased from $138.2 million in fiscal 1999 to $131.5 million in fiscal 2000. Revenue from this segment decreased in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 due to lower royalty rates paid by our OEMs and the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors: loss of royalty revenue from Hewlett-Packard Company's (""HP"") desktop monochrome laser printer division, which has been incorporating a clone version of Adobe PostScript software into its products since the fall of 1997; a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers; and an increase in the use of inkjet printers, resulting in weakness in the monochrome laser printer market. We categorize our geographic results into three major market regions: the Americas, EMEA, and Asia. In fiscal 2001, revenue generated in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia represented 48%, 27%, and 25% of total revenue, respectively, compared to 52%, 26%, and 22% of total revenue, respectively generated in both fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999. Overall, revenue from our application products on the Windows platform increased 9% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, and revenue from our application products on the Macintosh platform decreased by 21% in fiscal 2001 over fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, revenue from our application products on the Windows platform increased 39%, and revenue from our application products on the Macintosh platform increased 15% during the same period. In fiscal 2001, the Windows and Macintosh platforms accounted for 70% and 30%, respectively, of application products revenue, excluding platform-independent and UNIX products, compared to 63% and 37%, respectively, in fiscal 2000, and 58% and 42%, respectively, in fiscal 1999. We expect the trend towards the Windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future. 25 Direct Costs 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Direct costs $ 81.5 (7 )% $ 87.3 (8 )% $ 94.5 Percentage of total revenue 6.6 % 6.9 % 9.3 % Direct costs include product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies, hosted server costs, and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Direct costs decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, primarily due to lower third-party royalties, mainly associated with our PostScript and Type products revenue. In addition, direct costs also decreased in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 due to lower material costs. The decrease in direct costs in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was partially offset by an increase in hosted server costs, due to the launch of Adobe Studio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Direct costs also decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to lower localization and royalty costs, as well as a reduction in material costs as a result of our ongoing cost improvement program. For fiscal 2002, we anticipate that gross margin will be approximately 92% of revenue after the proposed acquisition of Accelio Corporation (""Accelio""). Operating Expenses Research and Development 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Research and development $ 224.1 (7 )% $ 240.2 22 % $ 197.5 Percentage of total revenue 18.2 % 19.0 % 19.4 % Research and development expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses decreased $16.1 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, primarily due to decreased incentive compensation expenses and lower company bonuses. In addition, research and development expenses also decreased due to lower contractor and professional fees as less development work was performed through outside sources. These decreases were partially offset by increased salary and benefit expenses related to headcount growth to support product development efforts. Research and development expenses increased $42.7 million, or 22%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 and higher salary and benefit expenses as a result of headcount growth. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in the new Network Publishing economy and make significant investments in the development of our application software products, including those targeted for the growing digital imaging and digital video franchises. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002. As communicated on December 13, 2001, we are targeting research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 to be 20-21% of revenue. For fiscal year 2002, we are targeting such expenditures also to be 20-21% of revenue. 26 Sales and Marketing 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Sales and marketing $ 403.7 0.6 % $ 401.2 22 % $ 328.5 Percentage of total revenue 32.8 % 31.7 % 32.3 % Sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses, bonuses, sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support, and distribution personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations, and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $2.5 million, or 0.6%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, as a result of higher salary and benefit expenses related to headcount growth and increased investments in product-specific marketing activities. These increases were offset by a decrease in incentive compensation expenses and company bonuses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $72.7 million, or 22%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses and higher outsourced technical support and order management fees. In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 due to our focus on general corporate brand advertising, as well as higher marketing, public relations, and trade show activities associated with new product releases. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 to support investments in certain areas including digital imaging, digital video, and ePaper-based businesses. As communicated on December 13, 2001, for the first quarter of fiscal 2002, our sales and marketing expense target is approximately 34-35% of revenue. For fiscal year 2002, we are targeting such expenditures also to be approximately 34-35% of revenue. General and Administrative 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 General and administrative $ 115.6 (0.8 )% $ 116.5 12 % $ 103.6 Percentage of total revenue 9.4 % 9.2 % 10.2 % General and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for the finance, human resources, legal, information services, and executive personnel of Adobe. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 0.8%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, due to decreased incentive compensation expenses and lower bad debt expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in salary and benefit expenses as a result of increased headcount. General and administrative expenses increased $13.0 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses as a result of increased headcount, and higher bad debt expense and legal fees. The increase was partially offset by decreases in professional fees and depreciation expense. We expect that general and administrative spending will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002. As communicated on December 13, 2001, for the first quarter of fiscal 2002, our general and administrative expense target is approximately 10-11% of revenue. For fiscal year 2002, we are targeting such expenditures to be approximately 9-10% of revenue. 27 Restructuring and Other Charges 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Restructuring and other charges $ 12.1 114 % $ 5.6 (76 )% $ 23.0 Percentage of total revenue 1.0 % 0.4 % 2.3 % In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to our future strategic goals and to align our resources with our fiscal year 2002 revenue targets. We believe this restructuring will enable us to increase our investment in digital imaging, digital video, and ePaper-based businesses in fiscal 2002. As part of the restructuring program, we implemented a reduction in force of 247 positions, affecting organizations throughout the company. The reductions came predominantly from sales and marketing and in our North American operations, and as of November 30, 2001, the majority of these terminations were completed. The total restructuring and other charges was $12.1 million, which was all related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force. Of the $12.1 million in charges, $9.6 million remained accrued at November 30, 2001. The majority of these severance payments will be paid in early 2002. For more information, see Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2000, restructuring and other charges consisted of $6.3 million of other charges relating to the disposal of certain equipment and one-time litigation related expenses, and a credit of $0.7 million related to the fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 restructuring programs. The $0.7 million credit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, as we revised our estimates of the total costs associated with the fiscal 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs. The credit primarily reflected lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within Adobe. The remaining credit was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities. (For detailed information, see Note 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). During fiscal 1999 we implemented two different restructuring programs. These separate restructuring programs were directly focused on improving our competitive position as well as enhancing Adobe's allocation of resources. The two fiscal 1999 restructuring programs resulted in total charges of approximately $19.7 million, which included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and charges for vacating leased facilities. During fiscal 1999, we revised our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring programs implemented during the year, resulting in an adjustment to the restructuring accrual of approximately $3.2 million. The adjustment was due to lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within Adobe, and lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities. In addition, we recorded adjustments during fiscal 1999 related to prior year restructuring programs in the amount of $1.9 million. The $1.9 million adjustment was primarily due to both our success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified and the expiration of other lease termination costs for two facilities. Other charges recorded in fiscal 1999 of $8.4 million included $2.0 million associated with the cancellation of a contract and $2.2 million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program. Additionally, we incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling $2.6 million for a terminated employee and incurred consulting fees of $1.6 million to assist in the restructuring of our operations. As of November 30, 2001 no obligations existed related to the fiscal 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs. 28 Acquired In-Process Research and Development 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Acquired in-process research and development $ — (100 )% $ 0.5 (87 )% $ 3.6 Percentage of total revenue — % — % 0.4 % In fiscal 2000, we recorded $0.5 million of acquired in-process research and development related to our acquisition of Glassbook, Inc. (""Glassbook""). The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 (""APB 16""). Based on an independent appraiser's valuation, $0.5 million of the total $28.0 million purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development due to the state of the development and the uncertainty of the technology. The ongoing project at Glassbook at the time of the purchase included the development of the Glassbook Reader and the Glassbook Content Server products. We released new products that contained the purchased technology in April 2001, with Acrobat eBook Reader 2.1 and Adobe Content Server 2.0. Acquired in-process research and development of $3.6 million in fiscal 1999 included $3.0 million and $0.6 million associated with the acquisitions of Attitude Software, LLC (""Attitude Software"") and Photomerge Technology (""Photomerge""), respectively. The following is a summary of the projects acquired in the acquisitions and the assumptions used in determining the value of the in-process research and development costs. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired substantially all of the assets, consisting of intellectual property, of Attitude Software. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with APB 16, and substantially all of the purchase price of $3.0 million cash was allocated to in-process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition. The ongoing project at Attitude Software at the time of the purchase included the development of the 3D Anarchy authoring product. We purchased this technology to incorporate it into future versions of our existing Adobe products to further enhance the feature sets and user interface contained within the products. We are incorporating the purchased technology into one of our products, which has not yet been released. At the date we acquired Attitude Software, it was estimated that 50% of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining 50% of the development effort would take approximately 18 months to complete and would cost $1.8 million. The efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily related to additional design efforts to integrate the technology into several of Adobe's products, finalization of coding, and completion testing. The value of the in-process technology was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products the technology would be integrated into, including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products, excluding the value attributed to the existing technology with the products prior to the integration of the purchased technology. These cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of 20%, exclusive of the value attributable to the use of the in-process technologies in future products. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we acquired substantially all of the assets, consisting of intellectual property, of Photomerge. In connection with the acquisition of Photomerge, 100% of the purchase price, or $0.6 million cash, was allocated to in-process research and development due to the early stage of development and the uncertainty of the technology. This purchased technology was incorporated into our Photoshop Elements product, which we released in April 2001. 29 Amortization of Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles $ 14.3 104 % $ 7.0 45 % $ 4.8 Percentage of total revenue 1.2 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles increased $7.3 million, or 104%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, due to a full year of amortization of Glassbook goodwill and purchased intangibles. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in fiscal 2000 and 1999 primarily related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of GoLive Systems, Inc. and a related partnership (together ""GoLive Systems"") in December 1998. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was higher in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 primarily due to the additional amortization related to the acquisition of Glassbook in September 2000. (For further information, see Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Nonoperating Income (Loss) Investment Gain (Loss) 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Investment gain (loss) $ (93.4 ) (751 )% $ 14.3 (84 )% $ 88.9 Percentage of total revenue (7.6 )% 1.1 % 8.8 % Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities, and equity method gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. During fiscal 2001, investment losses consisted of other-than-temporary writedowns related to our short-term investments in Tumbleweed Communications Corp. (""Tumbleweed""), Salon.com, Engage, Inc., Liquent, Inc. (formerly ESPS, Inc.), Avantgo, Inc., Viewpoint Corp., and Virage, Inc. of $53.1 million. These losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of our marketable equity securities totaling $20.1 million, of which $0.6 million of premiums were recorded in interest and other income. We also recorded net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $59.8 million. As of November 30, 2001, our short-term investments included marketable equity securities of $37.8 million and our long-term investments included investments in Adobe Ventures and other cost method investments of $31.7 million. These securities are inherently risky and we may experience further deterioration in fair value in the future. During fiscal 2000, we recorded investment gains related to the sale of a portion of our investment in Tumbleweed Communications Corp. (""Tumbleweed"") and Digimarc Corporation for $10.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded investment gains related to the mark-to-market valuation adjustment for AvantGo, Inc. totaling $13.0 million and other net gains related to various other Adobe Ventures investments activities totaling approximately $15.0 million. These gains were partially offset by investment losses related to the writedown of our investments in Engage, Inc.; Classmates Online, Inc. (formerly eCircles, Inc.); Salon.com; and Impresse Corporation, totaling approximately $26.3 million. In fiscal 1999, we recorded a realized gain of $58.4 million related to the sale of our investment in Vignette Corporation. We also recorded investment gains from mark-to-market adjustments totaling $17.8 million, $10.4 million, and $7.0 million related to investments in ESPS, Inc.; DigitalThink, Inc.; and Tumbleweed, respectively. These gains were partially offset by an investment loss of $5.2 million related to 30 the acquisition of PointCast, Inc., a former investee of Adobe, by idealab!'s Launchpad Technologies, Inc. (""idealab!""). In connection with the acquisition, we exchanged our shares of PointCast, Inc. for approximately 542,000 shares of idealab! (which has since become InfoGate, Inc.). Additionally, we recorded a net gain totaling $0.5 million related to mark-to-market adjustments of various other Adobe Ventures investments. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies and market valuations. Interest and Other Income 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Interest and other income $ 21.9 3 % $ 21.3 (17 )% $ 25.7 Percentage of total revenue 1.8 % 1.7 % 2.5 % Interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and realized gains or losses on the disposal of assets. Interest and other income increased $0.6 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to realized gains resulting from the sale of fixed income investments. Interest and other income also increased in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 due to higher average cash balances. The increase in interest and other income in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was partially offset by foreign currency losses. These foreign currency losses resulted from the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (""SFAS 133""), ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"" and subsequent recording of the cost of hedging foreign currency exposures in interest and other income. Interest and other income decreased $4.4 million, or 17%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 as a result of more investments being made in tax-exempt securities, resulting in lower interest income on a comparative pretax basis. In fiscal 2000, we also recorded foreign exchange transaction losses compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in fiscal 1999. In addition, other income was lower in fiscal 2000, as fiscal 1999 included a $5.7 million gain related to the sale of a corporate facility in Edinburgh, Scotland, in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal 1999. We expect interest and other income to decrease slightly to approximately $3.0-$4.0 million per quarter in fiscal 2002 due to a lower interest rate environment. We also believe that any increases in interest income may be offset by the cost of foreign currency purchased options as well as market price volatility under our implementation of SFAS 133. Further, we believe that our cash balances could also be reduced in fiscal 2002 due to the strategic purchase of companies, products, or technologies and our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Income Tax Provision 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Income tax provision $ 101.3 (35 )% $ 155.9 14 % $ 136.7 Percentage of total revenue 8.2 % 12.3 % 13.5 % Effective tax rate 33.0 % 35.1 % 36.5 % Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 and from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000, due to tax benefits associated with the restructuring of our international operations. As communicated on December 13, 2001, we have targeted our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2002 to approximately 32%. 31 Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations We believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors, including: •adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business, including the recent slow-down affecting the U.S., Europe, Japan, and potentially other geographic areas •continuing adverse economic impact of the recent national tragedy on September 11, 2001 •delays in shipment of our new products and major new versions of existing products •corporate reductions in marketing expenditures which may result in lower demand for professional content creation and layout products •lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades •introduction of new products by major competitors •weakness in demand for application software and printers •lack of growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and downward sales price adjustments •renegotiation of royalty arrangements •consolidation in the OEM printer business •ongoing weakness in our printing business due to product transitions •industry transitions to new business and information delivery models •market risks associated with our equity investments (as discussed later under ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"") On December 13, 2001, we stated that we are targeting our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2002 to be in the range of $265 to $280 million. On that day, we also stated the following operating model targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2002: gross margin of 92-93%, pro forma operating profit margin of 25-28%, research and development expenses of 20-21% of revenue, sales and marketing expenses of 34-35% of revenue, and general and administrative expenses of 10-11% of revenue. We further stated on December 13, 2001, that we expect our share count to be between 245 to 246 million shares, which collectively results in a pro forma earnings per share target range of $0.20 to $0.22, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. On January 31, 2002, we reiterated our revenue and earnings per share targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2002 of $265 to $280 million and $0.20 to $0.22, respectively. The reaffirmation of these targets assumes that the third month of the quarter will be a typical seasonally strong February. Also on December 13, 2001, we reiterated our annual revenue target of $1.3 billion, gross margin target of 93%, and our pre-tax pro forma operating profit margin target of 28% for fiscal year 2002 and a pro forma earnings per share target of approximately $1.03. Additionally, we have stated, the following operating model targets for fiscal 2002: research and development expenses of 20-21% of revenue, sales and marketing expenses of 34-35% of revenue, and general and administrative expenses of 9-10% of revenue. We have stated an effective tax rate target of 32%. We have also previously stated that we are targeting other income to be approximately $4.0 million per quarter. Due to the current interest rate environment, however, we have stated a revised target for interest and other income of approximately $3.0-$4.0 million per quarter in fiscal 2002. On February 1, 2002, we announced a proposed agreement to acquire Accelio Corporation. Based on an anticipated close date of March 2002, we are targeting incremental revenue associated with this acquisition of approximately $30.0-$35.0 million. In addition, with the acquisition of Accelio, we have lowered our gross margin target from 93% to 92%, and our pro forma operating profit margin target from 28% to 27%. Furthermore, we indicated that the acquisition would be dilutive to pro forma earnings per 32 share of $0.02 per share in fiscal year 2002. The proposed acquisition is subject to the execution of customary transaction documents and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the approval of Accelio's shareholders and clearance of the acquisition by U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities. If these conditions are not satisfied, we may not complete the acquisition. Initially the transaction was expected to close in March 2002. However, due to certain regulatory and timing requirements, we are now targeting to close in April 2002. In connection with this proposed acquisition, we may not be successful in integrating Accelio or developing products based on Accelio's technology or expertise. We also may not be successful in integrating its distribution channels with ours. Additionally, we may face unanticipated expenses relating to the integration of Accelio personnel and its products, distribution channels, and administrative functions. We use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments, not as predictions of future results. The targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions about: •product pricing and demand •manufacturing costs and volumes •the mix of application products and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, distribution channels, and geographic distribution •headcount increases These and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results, including results for the current quarter, to vary materially from these targets. In particular, the recent slow-down in some geographic areas, primarily in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, has affected all of our product segments and may adversely affect our ability to achieve our revenue targets. We attribute this slow-down, which is affecting all of our product segments, to weakening economic conditions. These adverse economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and potentially other geographic markets may continue in the short term, and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings. Although there were also adverse conditions in other countries, the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results. Furthermore, if the economic slow-down worsens or spreads to other geographic areas where we do business, it would likely cause our future results, including results for the first quarter of fiscal 2002, to vary materially from our targets. We plan to recruit key talent for our future growth. These plans to continue to invest in certain areas will require us to continue to hire additional employees. Competition for high-quality personnel, especially highly skilled engineers, is extremely intense. Our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems, and to attract, retain, motivate, and manage employees effectively; otherwise our business could be seriously harmed. Our ability to develop and market products, including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may also have an impact on our results of operations. Our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products. A portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings, or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations. We hold equity investments that have recently experienced significant declines in market value. We also have investments, and may continue to make future investments, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the market for the technologies or products they have under development is typically in 33 the early stages and may never materialize. Our investment activities can impact our net income. For fiscal 2001, we recorded pre-tax losses from marketable securities and other investments in privately held companies of $93.4 million, compared to pre-tax gains in fiscal 2000 of $14.3 million. These amounts reflect realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities, and equity method gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. In fiscal 2001, decreases in the market prices of these securities resulted in a significant reduction in our pre-tax income, and future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long-term declines in value could reduce our net income in future periods. We are uncertain of future investment gains and losses, as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies. The market for our graphics and ePaper applications is intensely and increasingly competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors. Additionally, Microsoft has increased its presence in the low-end consumer digital imaging/graphics market and the electronic document sharing markets. We believe that, due to Microsoft's market dominance, any new Microsoft products in these markets will be highly competitive with our products. If competing new products achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results would suffer. In addition, we continue to expand into third-party distribution channels, including VARs and systems integrators, in our effort to further broaden our customer base. As a result, the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success. Some of these companies are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions. Our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate. Also, as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the enterprise, corporate business and consumer markets, we may not successfully adapt our application software distribution channels, which could cause our operating results to suffer. As we currently have limited experience in these markets, we believe we will need to recruit, train, and retain personnel with experience in these markets, and our failure to do so may harm our ability to penetrate these markets. We could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business. In some markets and for some products, we have adopted a strategy aiming to increase our market share and therefore may receive significantly less revenue from certain licensing arrangements than we otherwise would receive for licensing these products. Therefore, increased market penetration may in fact lead to lower revenue growth in these areas. While we believe that this potential market share increase will ultimately benefit us, this strategy could instead harm our business through reduced revenue growth. We generally offer our application-based products on Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX platforms, and we generally offer our server-based products on the Linux platform as well as these three platforms. To the extent that there is a slow-down of customer purchases of personal computers on either the Windows or Macintosh platform or in general, our business could be harmed. We distribute our application products primarily through distributors, resellers, and retailers (collectively referred to as ""distributors""). A significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors. One of these distributors recently restructured its operations, reducing the number of facilities it operates, including those handling Adobe products, which may harm our operating results. In addition, we have revised our channel program to reduce the overall number of our distributors worldwide and focus our channel efforts on larger distributors. This revision of the channel program has resulted in an increase in our dependence on a smaller number of distributors selling through a larger amount of our products. Additionally, one of our goals is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our Web site at www.adobe.com. Any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online, Internet-based resellers of our products. While we anticipate that the restructuring and streamlining of our product distribution channels and the increase in the scope of our 34 direct sales efforts will eventually improve our business by decreasing discounts or rebate programs provided to distributors, decreasing product returns, and shortening inventory cycles, these changes could instead seriously harm our business. We currently rely on five turnkey assemblers of our products, located in each major region we serve. If any turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us, or if our supply from any turnkey is interrupted or terminated for any other reason, we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment experienced a 20% decline in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, primarily as a result of a decline in the print business. We expect this segment to continue to decline in fiscal 2002 relative to fiscal 2001, which may harm our business if the magnitude of the decline significantly exceeds our expectations. The continuing weakness in the economy is contributing to the decrease in revenue for the monochrome laser printers market in addition to the decline in average selling prices of monochrome laser printers and the increasing use of inkjet printers. In addition, customer transition from paper-based processes to electronic workflows, renegotiated pricing with certain OEM customers, and the outsourcing of certain OEM accounts to a third party solution provider contributed to the decline in revenue in this segment. If another major customer also decided to incorporate a clone version instead of Adobe PostScript technology, it could seriously harm our business. Further, OEM partners on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements. We evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for us. The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the Internet. As is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The software industry addressing authoring and communications over the Internet is still developing. Standards defining Web graphics have not yet been fully adopted. In addition, new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices. Moreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use and access, cost, and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect the growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets. We intend to increase our investment in e-business and enhanced marketing activities in an effort to achieve revenue growth, but we can provide no assurance that increased investment in this new market will result in increased revenue. We derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our customers located in Europe, Japan, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. We generally experience lower revenue from our European operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months. Additionally, we are uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions. While most of the revenue of our European subsidiaries had in the past been denominated in U.S. dollars, we now denominate revenue in euros in certain European countries. In addition, the majority of our revenue derived from Japan is denominated in yen, and the majority of all our subsidiaries' operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies. As a result, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the financial impact of such fluctuations has not been significant. Our hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks, based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. We have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily of the Japanese yen and the euro. We regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our best judgment. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates. 35 In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party rights, we have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to complex, protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation. Adverse decisions in such litigation could have negative results, including subjecting us to significant liabilities, requiring us to seek licenses from others, preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, any one of which could seriously harm our business. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ""AICPA""), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Our accounting policies that may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows: •rules relating to software revenue recognition •accounting for business combinations •the valuation of in-process research and development •employee stock purchase plans •stock option grants •goodwill and other intangible assets accounting Changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business. See the discussion under ""Critical Accounting Policies"" below for additional information about our critical accounting policies and some risks associated with these policies. New FASB guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition-related charges less predictable in any given reporting period. On July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (""SFAS 142""), ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" that establishes a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination. This Statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life not be amortized, but be tested for impairment at least annually. It would continue to require recognition of goodwill as an asset but would not permit amortization of goodwill as previously required by APB Opinion No. 17, ""Intangible Assets."" Under SFAS 142, goodwill will be separately tested for impairment using a fair-value-based approach. Any required goodwill impairment charges will be presented as a separate line item within the operating section of the income statement. The shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach would apply to previously recorded goodwill as well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001. We are currently evaluating the impact of this Statement on our financial position and are planning to adopt this standard beginning in fiscal year 2003, as required. It is possible that in the future, we may incur less frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded, as well as goodwill arising out of potential future acquisitions. 36 Due to the factors noted above, our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings, or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade, compared to analysts' or investors' expectations could cause, and has caused in the past, an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock. Finally, we participate in a highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to us, changes in analysts' earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment, our industry, or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company: revenue recognition, accounting for our marketable and non-marketable fixed income and equity securities, and accounting for leases of property and equipment. Revenue Recognition We recognize application products revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. Application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates, and price protection. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection when given, and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel, and other related factors. The estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on historical rates. While management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters, nevertheless unsold products in these distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences or technological obsolescence due to new operating environments, product updates or competing products. Accordingly, it is possible that these estimates will change in the near future or that the actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could seriously harm our business. We provide free technical phone support to customers who are under warranty for support. We accrue the estimated cost of free technical phone support upon shipment of software and amortize the accrued internal and external cost of telephone support to sales and marketing expense. We also license software with post-contract customer support (""PCS"") for two years. PCS includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, a limited period of telephone support, updates, and bug fixes. Statement of Position 97-2 (""SOP 97-2""), ""Software Revenue Recognition,"" as amended, generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements. The arrangement fee for multiple-element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement, such as maintenance and support services, based on the relative fair values of the elements. We determine the fair value of each element in multi-element arrangements based on vendor-specific objective evidence (""VSOE""). VSOE for each element is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. Revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term (typically two years). We record OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEM partners ship products incorporating Adobe software, provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable. We have no remaining obligations in relation to such licensing revenue. 37 We also recognize revenue under a subscription-based model for our Adobe Studio website, which we launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis from fees received that month for providing software subscriptions for our hosted application. Deferred revenue includes customer advances under OEM licensing agreements and maintenance revenue for application products. We recognize deferred maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the contract, generally twenty-four months. In cases where we will provide a specified free upgrade to an existing product, we defer revenue until the future obligation is fulfilled. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and generally do not require collateral. We maintain allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have been within our expectations. Accounting for our Marketable and Non-marketable Fixed Income and Equity Securities We classify all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments that are free of trading restrictions, or become free of trading restrictions within one year, as ""available-for-sale."" We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices, and unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recognized when realized on our consolidated statements of income. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income. For more information on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, please refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our long-term investments include direct investments and indirect investments in privately-held companies. We own limited partnership interests in four venture capital limited partnerships, Adobe Ventures L.P.; Adobe Ventures II, L.P.; Adobe Ventures III, L.P., and Adobe Ventures IV, L.P. (collectively ""Adobe Ventures""), that invest in early stage companies with innovative technologies. In addition to the potential for financial returns, our venture activities increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies, as well as expand our ecosystem of Adobe products and services. The partnerships are managed by Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures. The investments in Adobe Ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and accordingly, the investments are adjusted to reflect our share of Adobe Ventures' investment income (loss) and dividend distributions. Adobe Ventures carry their investments in equity securities at estimated fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in investment income (loss). The stock of a number of technology investments held by the limited partnerships at November 30, 2001 are not publicly traded, and, therefore, there is no established market for their securities. As such, the fair value of these investments are determined by Granite Ventures using the most recent round of financing involving new non-strategic investors, or estimates made by Granite Ventures. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments held by Adobe Ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes, and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. public companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of a company is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to 38 our equity method of accounting and the related writedown is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income. Estimating the fair value of non-marketable equity investments in early-stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations. We recognize realized gains and losses upon sale or maturity of these investments using the specific identification method. For further information on our long-term investments, please refer to Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Leases of Property and Equipment We entered into two operating lease agreements in 1999 and 2001 related to our headquarter office buildings in San Jose, CA. The agreements qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS 13, ""Accounting for Leases,"" and, as such, the buildings are not included on our balance sheet. These agreements are subject to standard covenants, including liquidity, leverage, and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessors quarterly. We believe we will be able to meet our obligations under the agreements, but if we default on our commitments and are unable to remedy the default quickly enough, the lessors may terminate all remaining commitments, demand payment equal to the lessor's investment, or require us to purchase, facilitate the sale of the buildings to a third party, or surrender the buildings. If we are required to purchase the buildings, this will decrease our cash available for working capital and require us to add the value of the buildings to our balance sheet. If we facilitate the sale or surrender the buildings, this could require us to find alternate facilities on terms that may not be as favorable as the current arrangement. As of November 30, 2001, we were in compliance with all covenants. For further information on these leases, please refer to our ""Commitments"" section under ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We Disclose Pro Forma Financial Information We prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call. Our pro forma financial information does not include unusual or non-recurring events or transactions, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, or gains and losses on investments in equity securities. We believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations. However, we urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that GAAP financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls. 39 The following table shows the Company's pro forma results reconciled to the GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal year ended November 30, 2001. Our pro forma results for the fiscal year 2001 exclude restructuring and other charges, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, and investment loss. Year ended November 30, 2001 GAAP income before income taxes $ 306,931 Restructuring and other charges 12,063 Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 14,281 Investment loss 93,414 Pro forma income before income taxes 426,689 Income tax provision 140,807 Pro forma net income 285,882 Basic pro forma net income per share $ 1.20 Shares used in computing basic net income per share 238,461 Diluted net income per share $ 1.15 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 249,145 Pro Forma Fair Value Disclosures on Employee Stock Plans We account for our employee stock plans, consisting of fixed stock option plans, an employee stock purchase plan, and a performance and restricted stock plan, using the intrinsic value method. Please see our Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma amounts of net income and net income per share that would have resulted if we accounted for our employee stock plans under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."" Recent Accounting Pronouncements During July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (""SFAS 141""), ""Business Combinations."" This Statement requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and redefines goodwill and other intangibles that should be recognized separate from goodwill. SFAS 141 is effective for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. During July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (""SFAS 142""), ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."" This Statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life not be amortized, but be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001; however, for new business combinations that occur after June 30, 2001, SFAS 142 is effective for those transactions. We will adopt SFAS 142 beginning in our fiscal year 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 142 on our financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (""SFAS 143""), ""Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."" This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This Statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, or normal use of the asset. As used in this Statement, a legal obligation results from existing law, statute, ordinance, written or oral contract, or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. SFAS 143 is 40 effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (""SFAS 144""), ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."" This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, ""Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,"" and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, ""Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business."" SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We will adopt SFAS 144 beginning in our fiscal year 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") reached a consensus on EITF No. 01-09, ""Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."" EITF No. 01-09 addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer and is a codification of EITF No. 00-14, ""Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives,"" EITF No. 00-22, ""Accounting for ""Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentives Offers and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future"" and EITF No. 00-25, ""Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."" We are evaluating the impact of EITF No. 01-09 and do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2001 Change 2000 Change 1999 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ 581.6 (14 )% $ 679.9 36 % $ 498.7 Working capital $ 453.7 (19 )% $ 563.3 59 % $ 355.4 Stockholders' equity $ 617.0 (18 )% $ 752.5 47 % $ 512.2 Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consist principally of money market funds, municipal bonds, and marketable equity securities. All of our short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale under the provisions of SFAS 115, ""Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."" The securities are carried at fair market value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recognized when realized on the consolidated statements of income. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased $98.3 million, or 14%, from December 1, 2000, primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock in the amount of $485.1 million, the purchase of long-term investments and other assets for $32.0 million, capital expenditures of $46.6 million, and the payment of dividends totaling $12.0 million. In addition, our short-term investments decreased due to the writedown of certain short-term marketable equity investments totaling $53.1 million and the sale of marketable equity investments with a cost basis of $7.8 million. These decreases were partially offset by cash generated from operations of $418.7 million and proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $87.5 million. Another source of cash included proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $31.5 million. Our existing cash, cash equivalent and investment balances may decline further during fiscal 2002, although we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. If the global economy weakens further, the decline in cash, cash equivalents and investments balances may be greater than presently anticipated. 41 We expect to continue our investing activities, including expenditures for computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to purchase treasury stock and strategically acquire companies, products, or technologies. Adobe's Board of Directors approved two separate two-for-one stock splits in the form of stock dividends of our common stock to stockholders effected October 24, 2000 and October 26, 1999. All share and per share amounts referred to in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect these stock splits. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of 1988. Adobe's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0125 per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999. The declaration of future dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of Adobe's Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, and other factors. Stock Repurchase Program I—On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program, which is designed to minimize dilution from employee stock plans, we sold put warrants to independent third parties in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999. Each put warrant entitles the holder to sell one share of Adobe's common stock to Adobe at a specified price for cash or stock at Adobe's option. Approximately 5.6 million, 7.0 million, and 10.3 million put warrants were written in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. At November 30, 2001, approximately 3.8 million put warrants were outstanding that expire through July 2002, with an average exercise price of $22.28 per share, resulting in a total potential cash outlay of approximately $84.0 million in fiscal 2002 if all puts warrants are exercised. In addition, in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, we purchased call options from independent third parties that entitled us to buy 3.9 million, 4.2 million, and 4.9 million shares, respectively, of our common stock on certain dates at specified prices. At November 30, 2001, approximately 2.6 million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through July 2002 with an average exercise price of $24.09 per share, resulting in a total potential cash outlay of approximately $63.3 million in fiscal 2002 if all calls options are exercised. Currently, all put warrants have a corresponding call option with an identical expiry date. Consequently, either the call option or put warrant, but not both, will be exercised. We repurchased approximately 5.9 million, 7.2 million, and 22.4 million shares in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, at a cost of $319.9 million, $255.5 million, and $448.7 million, respectively. Stock Repurchase Program II—Additional Authorization above Dilution Coverage In September 1997, Adobe's Board of Directors authorized, subject to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to 60.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period. This program was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Under this program, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares in fiscal 1999 at a cost of $30.5 million. In April 1999, the Board authorized a 5.0 million share repurchase program, which allows us to purchase shares in the open market and enter into contracts to repurchase shares during future quarters by selling put warrants and buying call options. During fiscal 2001, approximately 4.9 million put warrants were written and 3.5 million call options were purchased at prices ranging from $32.60 to $39.58. As of November 30, 2001, there were no put warrants or options outstanding in this program. During fiscal 2001, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares at a cost of $165.2 million. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in fiscal 2000. 42 In addition to the April 1999 5.0 million share repurchase program, our Board of Directors authorized in March 2001, subject to certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period. We have not made any purchases under this 5.0 million share repurchase program. Combined Programs Our put and call option contracts provide that we, at our option, can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the option as determined by the contract. For more information on our puts and calls, please see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commitments Our principal commitments as of November 30, 2001 consist of obligations under operating leases, a line of credit agreement, a real estate financing agreement, venture investing activities, royalty agreements, and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the below commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2025. Rent expense, net of sublease income, for these leases aggregated $22.0 million, $25.6 million, and $29.4 million during fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. As of November 30, 2001, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, net of sublease income, are as follows: 2002—$29.6 million; 2003—$32.3 million; 2004—$35.7 million; 2005—$28.5 million; 2006—$17.0 million; and $33.2 million thereafter. In September 2001, we entered into a real estate development agreement for the construction of an office building in downtown San Jose, California. Under the agreement, the lessor will finance up to $117.0 million over a two-year period, toward the construction and associated costs of the building. As part of the agreement, we entered into a five-year lease beginning upon completion of the building. We have an option to purchase the building at any time during the term for an amount equal to the total investment of the lessor. The agreement and lease are subject to standard covenants including liquidity, leverage and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessor quarterly. As of November 30, 2001, we were in compliance with all covenants. In case of a default, the lessor may terminate all remaining commitments, demand payment equal to the lessor's investment, or require that we purchase, facilitate the sale of the building to a third party, or surrender the building. The agreement qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS 13, and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included on our balance sheet, but the lease payments are reflected in the schedule of future minimum lease payments. At the end of the lease term, we can either purchase the building for an amount equal to the lessor's investment, which will be approximately $117.0 million, request to extend the maturity date of the lease or remarket the building. If we elect to remarket the building, we are obligated to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lessor's investment, up to a maximum recourse amount as set forth in the lease. The lessor is a multi-asset leasing company with a substantive net worth, not a special purpose entity. In August 1999, Adobe entered into a five-year lease agreement for our corporate headquarters office buildings in San Jose, California. Under the agreement, we have an option to purchase the buildings at any time during the lease term for $142.5 million, which is the total investment of the lessor. The lease is subject to standard covenants including liquidity, leverage and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessor quarterly. As of November 30, 2001, we were in compliance with all covenants. In case of a default, 43 the lessor may demand payment equal to the lessor's investment or that we surrender the buildings. The agreement qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS 13 and, as such, the buildings and the related obligation are not included on our balance sheet, but the lease payments are reflected in the schedule of future minimum lease payments. At the end of the lease term, we can either purchase the buildings for an amount equal to the lessor's investment, which is approximately $142.5 million, or terminate the lease. If we elect to terminate, we are obligated to use our best efforts to arrange the sale of the buildings to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lessor's investment, up to a maximum guaranteed residual amount as set forth in the lease. The lessor is a multi-asset leasing company with a substantive net worth, not a special purpose entity. Line of Credit In August 1999, Adobe entered into two unsecured revolving credit facilities, of $100.0 million each, with a group of banks, for general corporate purposes, subject to certain financial covenants. One of the facilities expired in August 2001 and was not renewed, and the other $100.0 million facility expires in August 2002. Outstanding balances would accrue interest at London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus a margin that is based on our financial ratios. There were no outstanding balances on the credit facility as of November 30, 2001. In addition, as of November 30, 2001, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. We believe that if our line of credit is canceled or amounts are not available under the line, our financial results, liquidity, or capital resources would not be adversely impacted. Under the terms of the line of credit agreement, corporate headquarters lease agreement, and real estate financing agreement, we may pay cash dividends unless an event of default has occurred or we do not meet certain financial ratios. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense was approximately $14.1 million, $20.8 million, and $24.5 million in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Adobe Ventures We have commitments to the Adobe Venture limited partnerships. The following table shows the capital commitments and the capital contributed as of November 30, 2001: Capital Commitment Capital Contributed Adobe Ventures L.P. $ 40,000,000 $ 40,475,757 Adobe Ventures II, L.P. $ 40,000,000 $ 36,947,363 Adobe Ventures III, L.P. $ 60,000,000 $ 56,162,222 Adobe Ventures IV, L.P. $ 100,000,000 $ 18,292,333 The capital commitment is the amount that Adobe has agreed to contribute to the Partnership. The capital commitment amount is contributed over the term of each Partnership, which is ten years. We can cease funding at any time after the earlier of: a) two years after the effective date of the Partnership or b) the date on which the Company has made capital contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of $10.0 million, $10.0 million, $20.0 million, and $33.0 million for Adobe Ventures L.P., Adobe Ventures II, L.P., Adobe Ventures III, L.P., and Adobe Ventures IV, L.P., respectively. In addition to these venture partnerships, we have direct investments in public and privately-held companies. In total, as of November 30, 2001, we have invested $194.9 million through our venture partnerships and direct investments. As of November 30, 2001, net returns were $354.3 million, including stock dividends and net gains in market value of investments. 44 Legal Actions We are engaged in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that we have adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Derivatives and Financial Instruments (Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in various foreign currencies, primarily in certain European countries and Japan. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen denominated licenses in Japan, and beginning in fiscal 2001, euro denominated licenses in certain European countries. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen, and our European operating expenses are in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated licenses. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. At November 30, 2001, total outstanding contracts included $98.3 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of $82.3 million. All contracts expire at various times through May 2002. Our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with high quality counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational (""cash flow"") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have a duration between three to twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (""USD""), primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2001, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. The critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions. The changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions. We record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments 45 in other income on the consolidated statement of income. The time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income over the life of the contract. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 30, 2001, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 60 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 30, 2001. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $16.0 million and $23.9 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $12.5 million and $18.1 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 30, 2001, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $37.8 million compared to $90.2 million at December 1, 2000, a decrease of 58%. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could experience further adverse changes in the near term. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown in our consolidated statements of income. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of minus 50%, 35%, and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. 46 Potential decrease to the value of securities given X% decrease in each stock's price (50%) (35%) (15%) Fair Value as of November 30, 2001 Marketable equity securities $ (18.9 ) $ (13.2 ) $ (5.7 ) $ 37.8 Equity Forward Contracts We also have a policy to hedge a certain portion of our equity holdings in publicly traded companies. From time to time, we have entered into forward contracts to sell portions of our equity holdings in future periods. We account for these forward contracts as ""Fair Value Hedges,"" in accordance with SFAS 133 and mark them to market at the end of each period, offsetting changes in the fair market value of the equities being hedged. An increase (decrease) in the market value of the underlying equities will result in a corresponding decrease (increase) in the value of the forward contract. We have no outstanding forward contracts hedging marketable equity securities remaining as of November 30, 2001. As of December 1, 2000, the value of our forward contracts hedging equity securities was $10.7 million. Fixed Income Investments At November 30, 2001, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $404.1 million compared to $369.7 million at December 1, 2000, an increase of 9%. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 30, 2001. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. Potential decrease to the value of fixed income securities given X% increase in interest rates. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6-month horizon $ (2.3 ) $ (4.5 ) $ (6.8 ) 12-month horizon $ (2.1 ) $ (4.1 ) $ (6.2 ) We do not currently have any derivative financial instruments outstanding to manage interest rate risks. However, we have established policies and procedures to allow entering into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk if appropriate. We also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time, the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to 2.3 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer, and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines, we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material. Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our entire initial investment in these companies. 47 We have a policy in place to review privately-held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes, and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. public companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to our equity method of accounting and the related writedown is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income. Facility Leases We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases of our facilities whose payments are tied to the LIBOR and have evaluated the hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in LIBOR. Market changes reflected immediate hypothetical parallel increases in the LIBOR curve of plus or minus 50, 100, and 150 basis points for a twelve-month period. Based on this analysis, such charges would not be material to our results of operations or financial position.",2023-12-30 17:04:33.809518

OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe offers a line of software for consumers, creative professionals and enterprises. Our products enable customers to create, manage and deliver visually rich, compelling and reliable content. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs; direct to end users; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, Linux, UNIX and various non-personal computer platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, income taxes and valuation of non marketable equity securities have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change. Our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must 32 determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events. We have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding channel inventory, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual. Income Taxes We provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, ""Accounting for Income Taxes."" Under this current accounting pronouncement, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Management must make significant assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Accounting for our Marketable and Non-Marketable Equity Securities It is our policy to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing the cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership of each investment. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write-down as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income. The ultimate value realized on these equity investments is subject to market volatility until they are sold. The stocks of a number of technology investments held both directly and by Adobe Ventures are not publicly traded and, therefore, there is no established market for these securities. In order to determine the fair market value of these investments, we use the most recent round of financing involving new non-strategic investors or other estimates of current market value. It is our policy to review the fair value of these investments held by Adobe Ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. The evaluation process is based on information we request from these privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. 33 publicly traded companies and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. Estimating the fair value of non-marketable equity investments in early-stage technology companies is inherently subjective, requiring significant judgment by management, and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2003 In fiscal 2003, our primary goal was to deliver a series of innovative products to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth. With new releases of our Acrobat desktop and server products, a new video software suite, new versions of our Creative Professional products and the introduction of Adobe Creative Suite, Adobe delivered more new releases in 2003 than in any previous year. The new releases of our Acrobat desktop products supported our ePaper segment strategy (which we renamed Intelligent Documents beginning in fiscal 2004), which was to concentrate on the adoption of Acrobat across several identified markets. The release of Adobe Creative Suite was also in line with our strategy for the Creative Professional business segment which was to continue our commitment to Creative Professionals by enabling more efficient collaboration and workflow through improved product integration and new functionality. Additionally, our overall revenues were positively impacted by the strength of the euro and the yen during fiscal 2003. We continue to focus on delivering innovative products and solutions for our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth. In fiscal 2004, we expect to see continued growth in our business segments. Our success could be limited by several factors, including the timely release of new products, continued market acceptance of our products, the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. For a further discussion of these and other risk factors, see the section titled ""Factors That May Affect Future Performance."" Revenue Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Product $ 1,269.0 10 % $ 1,153.2 (6 )% $ 1,229.7 Percentage of total revenues 98 % 99 % 100 % Services and support 25.7 * % 11.6 * % — Percentage of total revenues 2 % 1 % — Total revenues $ 1,294.7 11 % $ 1,164.8 (5 )% $ 1,229.7 *Percentage is not meaningful. We have four reportable segments that offer different product lines: Digital Imaging and Video, Creative Professional, ePaper, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Digital Imaging and Video segment provides users with software for creating, editing, enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs, digital video, audio and animations. The Creative Professional segment provides software for professional page layout, professional Web page layout, graphic and illustration creation, technical document publishing and business publishing. The ePaper segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create, enhance, annotate and securely send Adobe PDF files that can be shared, viewed, navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms. In addition, this segment provides server-based solutions for enterprises and government agencies in the areas of document generation, document process management and collaboration, and document control and security. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision. 34 Services and support is composed of professional services (such as consulting services and training) and support (such as maintenance and technical support) primarily related to the licensing of our ePaper server solutions products. Professional services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. A significant portion of our support revenue comprises our extended Enterprise Maintenance and Support offerings, which entitles customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support period, which is typically one year. Our support revenue also includes support for our desktop products whereby we offer a range of support programs, from fee-based incident to annual support contracts and developer support to partners and developer organizations. As noted in our 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we realigned our business segments at the beginning of fiscal 2003. The results for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, and the discussion that follows, have been reclassified to reflect the realignment of the operating segments. Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Digital Imaging and Video $ 392.4 (5 )% $ 411.9 (6 )% $ 439.7 Percentage of total revenues 30 % 35 % 36 % Creative Professional 368.5 5 % 351.3 (11 )% 393.3 Percentage of total revenues 29 % 30 % 32 % ePaper* 444.1 42 % 312.6 7 % 291.9 Percentage of total revenues 34 % 27 % 24 % OEM PostScript and Other 89.7 1 % 89.0 (15 )% 104.8 Percentage of total revenues 7 % 8 % 8 % Total revenues $ 1,294.7 11 % $ 1,164.8 (5 )% $ 1,229.7 *The ePaper segment includes professional services and support revenue. Fiscal 2003 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2002 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment decreased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products. Overall, we experienced a 7% decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products, which was mainly attributable to product lifecycle timing. With the introduction of Adobe Creative Suite, which includes Photoshop, we have experienced a shift in revenue from Photoshop to the Adobe Creative Suite which is reported in the Creative Professional segment. The 7% decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products was partially offset by an 8% increase in revenues from our digital video software products. The increase in revenues from our digital video software products was due primarily to new releases of Adobe Video Collection. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to a 57% increase in revenues from our professional page layout products. The growth in revenues from our professional page layout products was due to the release of new products during fiscal 2003, primarily the introduction of Adobe Creative Suite, as well as the planned migration of customers from our business publishing products. This increase was partially offset by decreases in revenues from our other products in the Creative Professional segment. Revenues from our business publishing products decreased 26% due to the planned migration of customers to our professional page 35 layout products. Finally, revenues from our illustration, type and technical publishing, and Web publishing products decreased by 15%, which was primarily attributable to product lifecycle timing. Revenue from our ePaper segment increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to new releases of our Acrobat desktop products during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, as well as increased sales and marketing focus, enhanced corporate and government licensing programs, and product price increases. Overall we experienced a 37% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products, which was driven by continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products in government, financial services, manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction markets among others. Additionally, revenues from our ePaper segment increased due to a 79% increase in revenues from licensing of our ePaper server solution products and the professional services and support revenue associated with these products. The increase in revenue generated from the licensing of our ePaper server solution products and associated professional services and support was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Accelio during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. While we expect revenue from our server products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004, we expect Acrobat desktop product growth to be lower in fiscal 2004 due to our strong results in fiscal 2003. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment remained relatively stable during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This was due to an increase in royalty revenues from our larger OEM customers during the first half of fiscal 2003. This increase was offset by a decline in revenues due to continued weakness in the print business throughout the year and smaller OEM customers moving to clone PostScript technologies. Revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue, but if the decline significantly exceeds our expectations, it may harm our future results. Fiscal 2002 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2001 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment decreased during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to an 18% decrease in revenues from our digital video software products due to a combination of product lifecycle timing and the economic impact on the digital video software market. We also experienced a 4% overall decline in revenues from our digital imaging software products. We believe the decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products was due to a combination of the economic weakness across the world, the impact of lower marketing spending by corporations resulting in a reduced number of Creative Professional customers, and the trend of our customers migrating towards the purchasing of Adobe Collection products as opposed to individual products, which are reported in the Creative Professional segment. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment decreased in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to a 23% decrease in revenues from our business publishing products. This decrease in revenues was due to a weaker global economy in 2002 when compared to 2001. There was a 29% decline in revenues from our type and technical publishing products due to overall economic weakness in the geographic markets in which these products are used. Additionally, there was a 35% decrease in revenues from our Web publishing products which we attributed to weakness in the Web-publishing market as well as less sales and marketing emphasis on these products. Finally, there was a 13% decrease in revenues from our illustration software due to product lifecycle timing and the continued economic impact on Creative Professional customers, who are the main end-user for this software. The decreases in revenue in our Creative Professional segment were partially offset by a 42% increase in revenues from our professional page layout products which is attributable to a planned migration of customers from our business publishing products, increased marketing activities and growing customer demand. Revenue from our ePaper segment increased during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to an increase in licensing of our ePaper Server Solutions products and the professional services and support revenue associated with these products. This increase is due to the acquisition of Accelio during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. 36 Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased during fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, due to the following factors: continued weakness in the print business, lower average selling prices generating less royalty revenue from certain OEM customers, and smaller OEM customers transferring to clone PostScript technologies. Geographic and Platform Information Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Americas $ 640.2 10 % $ 583.8 (1 )% $ 591.5 Percentage of total revenues 49 % 50 % 48 % EMEA 370.2 17 % 317.6 (3 )% 326.5 Percentage of total revenues 29 % 27 % 27 % Asia 284.3 8 % 263.4 (15 )% 311.7 Percentage of total revenues 22 % 23 % 25 % Total revenues $ 1,294.7 11 % $ 1,164.8 (5 )% $ 1,229.7 The increase in revenues, in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our ePaper desktop products. Additionally, revenue in EMEA and Asia increased due to the overall strength of the euro, in EMEA, and the yen in Asia, during fiscal 2003. The decrease in revenue from Asia in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to weakness in the Japan economy. The decreases in the Americas and EMEA during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 were due to product lifecycle timing and a weak economy that negatively impacted the Creative Professional customer. Total application platform mix (excluding platform independent and UNIX revenues) for fiscal 2003 was split 74% on Windows and 26% on Macintosh compared to 71% and 29%, respectively, in fiscal 2002 and 70% and 30%, respectively, in fiscal 2001. We expect the trend towards the Windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future as a significant majority of our ePaper revenues are on the Windows platform. In Adobe's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects. Prior to major product releases, we tend to have significant levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of receiving an order, subject to credit verification and our global channel inventory policy. Backlog is also subject to variability beyond our global channel inventory policy at the end of a reporting period, in amounts typically less than 5% of reported revenue. Our global channel inventory position continues to be within company policy. 37 Cost of Revenue Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Product $ 79.9 (18 )% $ 96.9 19 % $ 81.5 Percentage of total revenues 6 % 8 % 7 % Services and support 13.1 76 % 7.4 * % — Percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % — Total cost of revenues $ 93.0 (11 )% $ 104.3 28 % $ 81.5 *Percentage is not meaningful. Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies, and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. In fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, cost of product revenue also included hosted server costs associated with the Adobe DesignTeam. Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to product mix. During fiscal 2003, we received higher licensing revenue versus shrink-wrapped product revenue, compared to fiscal 2002, which resulted in lower material costs. Additionally, cost of product revenue for fiscal 2002 included the amortization and impairment costs associated with the Adobe DesignTeam, which was discontinued during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. An impairment charge of $5.5 million for capitalized hosted server costs associated with Adobe DesignTeam was recorded during fiscal 2002. Cost of product revenue increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to increased amortization of Web site development costs related to Adobe DesignTeam which was launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and the subsequent impairment charge for the remaining development costs. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee-related costs and the related costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, and from fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to the acquisition of Accelio during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Operating Expenses Research and Development Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Expenses 277.0 13 % $ 246.1 10 % $ 224.1 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 21 % 18 % Research and development expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. 38 Research and development expenses increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Of the 13% total increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2003, 7 percentage points of the increase were due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and 2 percentage points were due to an accrual for major product releases. The remaining 4 percentage points of the increase were due to various individually insignificant items. Research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits associated to headcount growth from the acquisition of Accelio to support product development efforts. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Expenses 423.4 11 % $ 380.4 (6 )% $ 403.7 Percentage of total revenues 33 % 33 % 33 % Sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support, order management and order fulfillment personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Of the 11% total increase in sales and marketing expenses, 9 percentage points of the increase were due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth, higher incentive compensation and higher sales commissions. The remaining 2 percentage points of the increase were due to various individually insignificant items. Sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to decreased marketing and advertising spending. General and Administrative Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Expenses 122.4 13 % $ 108.1 (7 )% $ 115.6 Percentage of total revenues 9 % 9 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses, directors and officers' insurance, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our finance, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Of the 13% overall increase in general and administrative expenses, 12 percentage points of the increase were due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and 4 percentage points were due to increased insurance costs. These increases were slightly offset 39 by 3 percentage points due to a decrease in depreciation related to assets that were written off in the prior fiscal year. General and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Of the 7% overall decrease, 3 percentage points were due to a decrease in contractor and professional fees, 3 percentage points were due to a decrease in facility expenses as a result of lower rent expenses, and 3 percentage points were due to a decrease in compensation and related benefits due to reduced headcount. These decreases were partially offset by 2 percentage points due to an increase in depreciation expenses. Restructuring and Other Charges Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Expenses $ (0.5 ) * % $ 12.1 1 % $ 12.1 Percentage of total revenues — 1 % 1 % *Percentage is not meaningful. During fiscal 2003, we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003, we reversed the excess accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we incurred a restructuring charge of $11.1 million, which included severance and related charges and the closure of a facility. The related restructuring program eliminated 239 engineering, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions worldwide in order to realign our resources for our future business plans. This restructuring plan was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Also, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate 39 redundant sales and marketing positions, held by Adobe employees worldwide, as a result of the acquisition of Accelio. The total restructuring charges, of $1.6 million, included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and the cost of vacating a leased facility. This restructuring plan was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to our future strategic goals and to align our resources with our lower fiscal 2002 revenue targets due to adverse economic conditions resulting in part from the events of September 11, 2001. This restructuring also enabled us to increase our investment in digital imaging, digital video and ePaper-based businesses in fiscal 2002. The restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 was $12.1 million, all of which related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force. During fiscal 2002, we lowered our estimate of the total costs associated with this restructuring plan, resulting in an adjustment of approximately $0.6 million. The adjustment primarily reflected lower than estimated relocation and severance expenses and related charges. This restructuring plan was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Acquired In-Process Research and Development Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Expenses $ — * % $ 5.8 * % $ — Percentage of total revenues — * % — *Percentage is not meaningful. 40 On April 12, 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Accelio. Accelio was a provider of Web-enabled solutions that help customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms. We obtained an independent appraiser's valuation to determine the amounts allocated to purchased technology and in-process research and development. The valuation analysis utilized the Income Approach that takes into consideration discounted future cash flows. Based on this valuation $0.4 million was allocated to in-process research and development, which was expensed as of the date of the acquisition due to the state of the development of certain products and the uncertainty of the technology. In December 2001, we acquired Fotiva. Substantially all of Fotiva's assets were intellectual property. Fotiva was a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage, store, enrich, and share digital photographs and other related personal media. In connection with the acquisition, substantially all of the purchase price of $5.4 million cash was allocated to in-process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in-process state of the technology. At the date we acquired Fotiva, it was estimated that 50% of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining 50% of the development effort would take approximately eleven months to complete. The efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily include finalization of coding, internationalization, and extensive quality assurance testing. We developed a new product, Adobe Photoshop Album, that we released in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 using Fotiva's image management technology combined with our digital imaging and ePaper technologies. Amortization and Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased and Other Intangibles Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Expenses $ — * % $ 21.0 47 % $ 14.3 Percentage of total revenues — 2 % 1 % *Percentage is not meaningful. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (""SFAS 142""), ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Instead, the goodwill associated with past and any future acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment. For further information, see Notes 1 and 5 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible assets with definite lives are still being amortized and are included in cost of product revenue. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we assessed our goodwill for impairment. This assessment did not result in an impairment of goodwill. Amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased and other intangibles increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge for the remaining book value of the Glassbook acquisition. The impairment charge was determined based on discounted future cash flows. 41 Non-operating Income (Loss) Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Investment loss $ (12.9 ) 25 % $ (17.2 ) 82 % $ (93.4 ) Percentage of total revenues (1 )% (1 )% (8 )% Interest and other income 13.9 (6 )% 14.9 (32 )% 21.9 Percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 2 % Total non-operating income (loss) $ 1.0 * % $ (2.3 ) 97 % $ (71.5 ) *Percentage is not meaningful. Investment Loss Investment loss consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, and equity method gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. During fiscal 2003, net investment losses included net losses related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $12.0 million. This loss of $12.0 million was partially offset by gains of $3.1 million from the sale of our marketable equity securities. During fiscal 2003, investment losses also included write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of $4.0 million related to our short-term investments in Salon Media Group, Viewpoint Corporation and Virage, Inc. During fiscal 2002, investment losses consisted of net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $13.1 million. We also recorded other-than-temporary write-downs related to our marketable equity securities in DigitalThink, Inc., Tumbleweed Communications Corp., Engage, Inc., Virage, Inc., Viewpoint Corporation, AvantGo, Inc., and Salon Media Group, Inc. of $11.3 million. These losses were partially offset by gains totaling $7.2 million from the sale of our marketable equity securities. During fiscal 2001, investment losses consisted of other-than-temporary write-downs related to our marketable equity securities in Tumbleweed Communications Corp., Salon Media Group, Inc., Engage, Inc., Liquent, Inc. (formerly ESPS, Inc.), AvantGo, Inc., Viewpoint Corporation, and Virage, Inc. of $53.1 million. These losses were partially offset by gains totaling $19.5 million from the sale of our marketable equity securities. We also recorded net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $59.8 million. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying companies and market valuations. These marketable equity securities are inherently risky investments and we may experience further deterioration in fair value in the future. Interest and Other Income The largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and interest expense. While the average amount of our invested cash increased from $595.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $753.6 million in fiscal 2003, our earned interest actually decreased by $0.4 million due to the lower interest rate environment. We also recognized $1.7 million less in recognized gains on our fixed income 42 portfolio. Those decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in other miscellaneous income. Interest and other income decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $6.0 million as a result of lower interest rates and lower realized gains of $2.5 million from the sales of fixed income investments. The decreases in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 were partially offset by a reduction in losses of $1.1 million related to the lowered cost of purchased options used in foreign currency hedging. Income Tax Provision Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Provision $ 114.1 22 % $ 93.3 (8 )% $ 101.3 Percentage of total revenues 9 % 8 % 8 % Effective tax rate 30.0 % 32.8 % 33.0 % Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 and in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001, due to the benefits associated with the structure of our international operations. Part of the tax rate decrease in fiscal 2002 was offset by a tax rate increase, approximately 0.8%, due to the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment expense. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE We believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors, including: •general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business •delays in development or shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products •difficulties in transitions to new business models or markets in the enterprise, government, consumer and creative professional markets •introduction of new products by existing and new competitors, particularly Microsoft •difficulties in implementing strategic alliances •changes to our distribution channel •inability to attract and retain key personnel •lack of market acceptance of new products, upgrades and services •changes in demand for application software, computers and printers •intellectual property disputes and litigation •industry transitions to new business models •renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property licensing arrangements •changes in accounting rules, such as expensing of stock options •unanticipated changes in tax rates •market risks associated with our equity investments (as discussed later under ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"") We periodically provide operating model targets for revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating margin, other income, tax rate, share count and earnings per share. We use these targets to assist 43 us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments, not as predictions of future results. The targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions about: •product pricing and demand •economic and seasonal trends •manufacturing costs and volumes •the mix of application products and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, distribution channels and geographic areas These and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results to vary materially from these targets or from results from prior periods. Furthermore, if the economy worsens or the economic slow-down spreads to other geographic areas where we do business, it would likely cause our future results to vary materially from our targets. The slower economy may also adversely affect our ability to grow, and political instability in any of the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business. The end markets for our software products are intensely and increasingly competitive, and are significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors. In the markets served by our ePaper business (which was renamed Intelligent Documents business beginning in fiscal 2004), Microsoft has recently launched a new electronic form tool called InfoPath as part of the new version of their professional Office product. We believe that Microsoft's new InfoPath product competes with certain aspects of our Intelligent Documents product line. Given Microsoft's market dominance, InfoPath, or any new competitive Microsoft product or technology that is bundled as part of their Office product or operating system, could harm our overall Intelligent Documents market opportunity. In addition, Microsoft is working on the next generation of its Windows operating system, codenamed Longhorn, which could be released as early as late 2005. It is anticipated that Microsoft will add new electronic document capabilities to Longhorn, potentially providing additional competition to our Intelligent Document products and solutions. Furthermore, Microsoft has increased its presence in the low-end and mid-range consumer digital imaging markets. If competing Microsoft products achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets. Any further consolidations among our competitors may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations. Also, as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the enterprise, government, consumer and creative professional markets, we may not successfully adapt our application software products, business models, or licensing and distribution channels to these changes, which could cause our operating results to suffer. If we are unable to successfully implement as planned any of our strategic alliances or develop the necessary relationships with enough significant systems integrators to adapt to these changes, our business could be harmed. Additionally, these new markets may result in higher costs and higher acceptance, warranty and indemnification risks than our other markets. We plan to recruit key talent for our future growth, especially to support our enterprise business. Competition for such high-quality personnel, especially highly skilled engineers, is intense. Our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems; otherwise our business could be seriously harmed. We rely on equity compensation in order to recruit and retain highly skilled employees in a competitive environment. If we are unable to provide adequate equity compensation incentives to effectively recruit and retain talented employees, our business may be harmed. Any delays or failures in developing and marketing our products, including upgrades of current products, may also have a harmful impact on our results of operations. Our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products. A portion of our future revenue will come from 44 these new applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect these delays or the introduction of new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations. We offer our application-based products primarily on Windows and Macintosh platforms and on some UNIX platforms. We generally offer our server-based products, but not desktop products, on the Linux platform as well as the Windows and UNIX platforms. To the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers on either the Windows or Macintosh platform or in general, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on the Linux desktop platform before we choose and are able to offer our products on this platform, our business could be harmed. We distribute our application products primarily through distributors, resellers, retailers and increasingly systems integrators, ISVs and VARs (collectively referred to as ""distributors""). A significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors. In addition, our channel program now focuses our efforts on larger distributors, which has resulted in our dependence on a relatively small number of distributors licensing a large amount of our products. Our distributors sell our competitors' products; if our distributors favor our competitors' products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. In addition, the financial health of these distributors and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions. Our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakens. In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, including rights derived from third-party licensors. Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results, including subjecting us to significant liabilities, requiring us to seek licenses from others, preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, any one of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, although we actively pursue software pirates as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights, we do lose revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities increase, it may further harm our business. Our computer network and applications could be adversely impacted by malicious code such as worms and viruses, which are released into the public Internet using recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs. The documents created by our applications, even those with security features, are also vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking. Although we have a response team that is notified of high-risk malicious events from multiple sources and we take certain preventative measures, these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our business. We currently rely on six turnkey assemblers of our products, with at least two turnkeys located in each major region we serve. If any significant turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us, or if our supply from any significant turnkey assembler is interrupted or terminated for any other reason, we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business. Although revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment remained relatively stable during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, we expect revenue from this segment to decline in the future. Our 45 overall business may be harmed if the magnitude of the decline significantly exceeds our expectations. The continuing weakness in the economy and aggressive competition among printer manufacturers is contributing to pressure on the average selling price of printers, which may result in the reduction of our royalty arrangements or the adoption by an OEM of alternative technology. The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communications over the Internet. As is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The industry for software that addresses authoring and communications over the Internet is still developing. Standards defining Web graphics have not yet been fully adopted. In addition, new models for licensing software may be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices. The new models may be less lucrative for us than our existing business models. Moreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use and access, cost and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect the growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets. Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. These factors include: •delays in development or shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products •any seasonality of technology purchases in our geographical markets •difficulties in transitions to new business models or markets, including the enterprise and government markets •any delays in recognizing revenue on any transaction •any changes in general economic conditions •changes in our pricing policies or the policies of our competitors •changes to our product offering models, including the Creative Suites platform Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have significant financial impact. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our judgment. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ""AICPA""), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows: •software revenue recognition •accounting for stock options •accounting for variable interest entities •accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets •accounting for guarantees and indemnities 46 In particular, new FASB guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition-related charges less predictable in any given reporting period. It is possible that in the future, we may incur less frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to goodwill we have already recorded, as well as goodwill arising out of potential future acquisitions. See ""Goodwill and Purchased and Other Intangible Assets"" in Note 1 of our Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this new FASB pronouncement. Changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We hold equity investments in public companies that have experienced significant declines in market value. We also have investments and may continue to make future investments in privately held companies, many of which are considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the market for the technologies or products these companies have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our investment activities can impact our net income. We recorded pre-tax losses from marketable securities and other investments in privately held companies of $12.9 million, $17.2 million and $93.4 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts reflect realized losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities and net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, decreases in the market prices of our marketable equity securities resulted in decreases in our pre-tax income. Future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long-term declines in value of any of our investments could reduce our net income in future periods. We are uncertain about future investment gains and losses, as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies. Due to the factors noted above, our future earnings and stock price may be subject to volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade compared to analysts' or investors' expectations has caused and could cause in the future an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock. Finally, we participate in a highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to us, changes in analysts' earnings estimates for us or our industry, and factors affecting the corporate environment, our industry, or the securities markets in general, will often result in volatility of our common stock price. 47 EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS Option Program Description Our stock option program is a long-term retention program that is intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We consider our stock option program critical to our operation and productivity. Option vesting periods are generally three years for all of the plans within our stock option program. For further information regarding our stock option program, see Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All stock option grants to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Executive Compensation Committee are independent directors, as defined in the current rules applicable to issuers traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. See the ""Report of the Executive Compensation Committee"" appearing in our 2004 Proxy Statement for further information concerning the policies and procedures, of the Company and the Executive Compensation Committee, regarding the use of stock options for executive officers. In May 2003, a stock option exchange program was initiated that allowed eligible employees to exchange options granted with an option price greater than $40 per share for a lesser number of new options, according to specified exchange ratios. The program excluded executive officers and members of our Board of Directors. The cancellation date for the program was June 16, 2003. On June 17, 2003 we accepted for cancellation, options to purchase approximately 7.1 million shares of common stock. On December 17, 2003, eligible employees received new options to purchase approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock, in exchange for such cancelled options, with an exercise price of $39.10. The tables below include options to purchase 3.5 million shares as estimated as of November 28, 2003. Distribution and Dilutive Effect of Options The table below provides information about stock options granted for fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001 to our Chief Executive Officer and our four other most highly compensated executive officers as of November 28, 2003. This group is referred to as the Named Executive Officers. Please refer to the section below, titled ""Stock Option Exercises and Option Holdings,"" for the Named Executive Officers. Options granted to employees, directors and Named Executive Officers for the fiscal years 2001 through 2003 are summarized as follows (*): 2003 2002 2001 Net grants during the period as % of outstanding shares (3 )% 3 % 6 % Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of total options granted 0 % 21 % 11 % Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of outstanding shares 0 % 1 % 1 % Cumulative options held by Named Executive Officers as % of total options outstanding 16 % 15 % 12 % (*)""Net grants"" equals the sum of the number of shares subject to options granted during the specified period reduced by the number of shares subject to options which were canceled or otherwise terminated during such period. Net grants as a percentage of outstanding shares are based on 238.3 million shares, 232.0 million shares, and 236.2 million shares of our common stock outstanding as of November 28, 2003, November 29, 2002 and November 30, 2001, respectively. 48 During fiscal 2003, we granted options to purchase approximately 2.0 million shares of our stock to our employees and directors and canceled approximately 9.4 million shares. For additional information about our employee stock option plan activity for the years 2001 through 2003, and pro forma earnings presentation as if we had accounted for our grant of employee stock options using the fair value method of accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (""SFAS No. 123""), ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" refer to Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not grant any stock options to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2003. Options granted to the Named Executive Officers as a percentage of the total options granted to all employees and directors vary from year to year. For additional information about the compensation of our executive officers and stock option grants to our Named Executive Officers, refer to our 2004 Proxy Statement.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Year Ended November 28, 2003 % Change 2002 to 2003 Year Ended November 29, 2002 % Change 2001 to 2002 Year Ended November 30, 2001 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 1,096.5 78 % $ 617.7 6 % $ 581.6 Working capital 892.5 104 % 436.9 (4 )% 453.7 Stockholders' equity 1,100.8 63 % 674.3 9 % 617.0 Adobe ended fiscal 2003 with $1,096.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of $478.8 million compared to fiscal 2002 year end. Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll (salaries, bonuses, and benefits), general operating expenses (marketing, travel, office rent) and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2003 of $433.1 million primarily comprised net income, net non-cash related expenses of $140.1 million, and increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs, sales and marketing programs, legal fees and accruals for major product releases. Income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations. These increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges. The increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year. The decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs. During fiscal 2002, cash provided by operating activities of $329.3 million was primarily due to net income, net non-cash related expenses of $118.9 million, an increase in income taxes payable and deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable. Income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations. The decrease in trade receivables was primarily due to our improved collections during fiscal 2002. These 51 increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease in accrued restructuring charges and accrued expenses. Accrued restructuring charges decreased primarily due to the payment of severance and related charges. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2001 of $418.7 million was primarily due to net income, net non-cash related expenses of $197.1 million, and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of $16.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 of $548.4 million increased from cash used in fiscal 2002 of $142.3 million, primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, net of maturities and sales. The increase in purchases of short-term investments is attributable to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds from the re-issuance of treasury stock during fiscal 2003. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2002 increased from cash used in fiscal 2001 of $26.4 million primarily due to increased purchases of short-term investments because of lower treasury stock purchases. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2003 of $117.0 million increased from cash used in fiscal 2002 of $223.3 million. During fiscal 2003, more employees exercised their stock options due to higher stock prices. In fiscal 2003, the net result of exercised options and stock repurchases was an inflow of $128.6 million due to the rise in stock price and lower stock repurchases as we were targeting higher cash levels. Cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2002 decreased from cash used in fiscal 2001 of $409.6 million primarily due to stock repurchase activities. Cash used for stock repurchases in fiscal 2002 decreased due to a lower average per share cost. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of 1988. Adobe's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0125 per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal 2003 and 2002. Under the terms of our lease agreements for our San Jose headquarters, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs. The declaration of future dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of Adobe's Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, and other factors. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Adobe uses highly regarded investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. The total return on invested balances in fiscal 2003 was 3.45%, exceeding the industry standard benchmarks established for our investment management firms. External investment firms actively managed 88% of Adobe's invested balances during the year. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds within the U.S. and in highly rated corporate and sovereign obligations outside of the U.S. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. All investments are made according to guidelines and within compliance of policies approved by the Board of Directors. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2004 in the event of further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in the section ""Factors That May Affect Future Performance."" Also, while we currently have no committed lines of credit, we believe 52 that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market, if required. Stock Repurchase Program I—On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program designed to minimize dilution from stock issuance primarily from employee stock plans, we have historically repurchased shares in the open market, sold put warrants and purchased call options. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. In fiscal 2003, we did not sell any put warrants. In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we sold approximately 7.5 million and 5.6 million put warrants, respectively. Each put warrant entitled the holder to sell one share of Adobe's common stock to Adobe at a specified price for cash or stock at Adobe's option. At November 28, 2003, no put warrants were outstanding. In fiscal 2003, we did not purchase any call options. In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we purchased call options that entitled us to buy 4.9 million and 3.9 million shares, respectively, of our common stock on certain dates at specified prices. At November 28, 2003, no call options were outstanding. Stock Repurchase Program II—Additional Authorization above Dilution Coverage In April 1999, the Board authorized a 5.0 million share repurchase program, which allowed us to purchase shares in the open market and enter into contracts to repurchase shares during future quarters by selling put warrants and buying call options. This program expired in fiscal 2001. In March 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period, subject to certain business and cash flow requirements. The program expired on March 2, 2003. On September 25, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a three-year period, subject to certain business and cash flow requirements. The authorization for this program will expire in September 2005. The tables below represent our authorized stock repurchase plans and summary of stock repurchases as of November 28, 2003.

(2)These are exercises of outstanding put and call options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 28, 2003, consist of obligations under operating leases, real estate financing agreements, royalty agreements and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2091. Rent expense, net of sublease income, for these leases aggregated $32.4 million, $26.6 million and $22.0 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In September 2001, we entered into a real estate development agreement for the construction of an additional office building for our corporate headquarters in downtown San Jose, California. Under the agreement, the lessor agreed to finance up to $117.0 million over a two-year period, toward the construction and associated costs of the building. The construction of the building was completed in December 2003. Due to lower than expected financing and construction costs, the final lease balance was lowered to $103.0 million. As part of the agreement, we entered into a five-year lease that began upon the completion of the building. At the end of the lease term, we can purchase the building for the lease balance, remarket or relinquish the building. If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, up to the maximum recourse amount of $90.8 million (""residual value guarantee""). See Note 14 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 54 In August 1999, we entered into a five-year lease agreement for our other two office buildings that currently serve as our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. Under the agreement, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time during the lease term for the lease balance, which is approximately $142.5 million. We are in the process of evaluating alternative financing methods at expiration of the lease in fiscal 2004 and believe that several suitable financing options will be available to us. At the end of the lease term, we can purchase the buildings for the lease balance, remarket or relinquish the buildings. If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the buildings, we are bound to arrange the sale of the buildings to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, up to the maximum recourse amount of $132.6 million (""residual value guarantee""). For further information, see Note 14 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The two lease agreements discussed above are subject to standard financial covenants. The agreements limit the amount of indebtedness we can incur. A leverage covenant requires us to keep our debt to EBITDA ratio less than 2.5:1.0. As of November 28, 2003, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.53:1.0, well within the limit. We also have a liquidity covenant which requires us to maintain a quick ratio equal to or greater than 1.0. As of November 28, 2003, our quick ratio was 2.2, well above the minimum. We expect to remain within compliance in the next 12 months. We are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our cash or credit in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of November 28, 2003: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income $ 83.9 $ 23.6 $ 25.9 $ 16.3 $ 18.1 Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. We have commitments to make certain milestone and/or retention payments typically entered into in conjunction with various acquisitions, for which we have made accruals in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with our purchases of technology assets during fiscal 2003, we entered into employee retention agreements totaling $2.2 million. We are required to make payments upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the agreements. As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request 55 in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income, was approximately $14.5 million, $14.4 million and $14.1 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Other Information Consistent with Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are responsible for listing the audit and non-audit services pre-approved in the fourth quarter of 2003 by our Audit Committee to be performed by KPMG LLP, our external auditor. Each of the permitted non-audit services has been pre-approved by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee's Chairman pursuant to delegated authority by the Audit Committee, other than de minimus non-audit services for which the pre-approval requirements are waived in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Audit Committee pre-approved the following non-audit services anticipated to be performed by KPMG LLP: 1) fiscal 2003 tax return services and 2) general tax consulting services. 56 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in foreign countries, in U.S. dollars and in various foreign currencies. In Europe and Japan, those transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen-denominated product and support revenue in Japan and euro-denominated product and support revenue in certain European countries. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, our exposures were 21.3 billion yen and 20.5 billion yen, respectively. In fiscal 2003 and 2002, our exposures were 274.0 million euros and 288.5 million euros, respectively. In addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional foreign subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ending November 28, 2003 and November 29, 2002 this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $30.8 million and $33.9 million, respectively. At this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen, and our European operating expenses are primarily in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. At November 28, 2003, total outstanding contracts included the notional equivalent of $191.5 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of $112.4 million. As of November 28, 2003, all contracts were set to expire at various times through April 2004. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational (""cash flow"") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 28, 2003, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. The critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions. The changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected 57 cash flows from the forecasted transactions. We record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income. The time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income (loss) over the life of the contract. See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 28, 2003, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 28, 2003. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $21.3 million and $34.0 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $16.3 million and $24.7 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 28, 2003, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $7.2 million compared to $14.1 million at November 29, 2002, a decrease of 49%. The decrease was due to sales of $4.0 million and write-downs of $4.0 million, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in market value adjustment. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each company's cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity 58 securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write-down in our consolidated statements of income. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35%, and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. 50% 35% 15% Marketable equity securities $ (3.6 ) $ (2.5 ) $ (1.1 ) Fixed Income Investments At November 28, 2003, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $1,069.0 million compared to $581.7 million at November 29, 2002, an increase of 84%. This increase was primarily due to strong operational cash flow, proceeds from stock option exercises and lower levels of stock repurchases. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. The table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. Less than one year $ 517.8 One year to two years 322.0 Greater than two years 229.2 Total $ 1,069.0 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 28, 2003. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (5.0 ) $ (9.9 ) $ (14.5 ) 12 month horizon $ (4.2 ) $ (8.4 ) $ (13.9 ) We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time, the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to 2.5 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Due to limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material. Interest Rate Hedging Instruments We are exposed to interest rate risk on operating lease obligations that are tied to short-term interest rates (LIBOR). While the exposure of our fixed income portfolio to similar short-term interest rates may naturally offset some of the risk, in general as short-term interest rates rise, it may negatively impact our operating income. It is our strategy to hedge a portion of that risk. Our policy permits us to hedge this interest rate risk using swap agreements. The swap agreements exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments with high quality counterparties. Our swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133 because they hedge against changes in the amount of future cash flows. The critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying lease obligation, so the 59 change in fair value of the swaps is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. If, for some reason, the terms of the hedge no longer matched the underlying obligation, the change in value of the ineffective portion would be recognized in other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income. Our swaps mature at various dates through the third quarter of fiscal 2004, consistent with the expiration of the underlying lease obligations. The total amount of lease obligations subject to interest rate risk is $245.5 million. We have hedged $121.8 million using interest rate swaps. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our interest rate hedges as of November 28, 2003. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of minus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over a six-month time horizon. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our interest rate hedges given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (0.1 ) $ (0.2 ) $ (0.2 ) See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. It is our policy to review privately-held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies.

OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe offers a line of software and services for consumers, creative professionals and enterprises, in both private and public sectors. Our products enable customers to create, manage and deliver visually rich, compelling and reliable content. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs; direct to end users; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, Linux, UNIX and various non-personal computer platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see the discussion in the section titled ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" below and Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change. Our revenue recognition policy is one of our 36 critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions, if any, must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") recently enacted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123—revised 2004 (""SFAS 123R""), ""Share-Based Payment"" which replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (""SFAS 123""), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (""APB 25""), ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."" SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. 37 We are required to adopt SFAS 123R in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts, for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, as if we had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2 (""FAS 109-2""), ""Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (""AJCA"")."" See ""Income Tax Provision"" under ""Results of Operations"" and Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding FAS 109-2. See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements. 38 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2004 During the fiscal 2004, we continued to focus on delivering comprehensive technology platforms for enterprises and creative professionals to drive revenue and earnings growth. Our latest Acrobat desktop products, released during fiscal 2003, continued to perform well which indicates we are making progress against our Intelligent Documents segment strategy to increase the adoption of Acrobat. Our Intelligent Documents initiatives continue to deliver a comprehensive server-based platform to help governments and enterprises improve their business processes. Our Intelligent Documents server revenue has achieved both strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. Additionally, we believe our strategy of providing creative professionals a complete design platform is resonating with our customers. The success we achieved in fiscal 2003 in our Creative Professional business segment continued in fiscal 2004 due to strong licensing of our Adobe Creative Suites and CS products. We continue to focus on delivering innovative products and solutions for our customers. However, our success could be limited by several factors, including the timely release of new products, continued market acceptance of our products, the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. For a further discussion of these and other risk factors, see the section titled ""Factors That May Affect Future Performance."" Revenue Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Product $ 1,634.0 29 % $ 1,269.0 10 % $ 1,153.2 Percentage of total revenues 98 % 98 % 99 % Services and support 32.6 27 % 25.7 122 % 11.6 Percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 1 % Total revenues $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 11 % $ 1,164.8 We have four reportable segments: Digital Imaging and Video, Creative Professional, Intelligent Documents, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Digital Imaging and Video segment provides users with software for creating, editing, enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs, digital video, audio and animations. The Creative Professional segment provides software for professional page layout, professional Web page layout, graphic and illustration creation, technical document publishing and business publishing. Additionally, this segment provides Photoshop and Acrobat Professional as part of its Adobe Creative Suite products. The Intelligent Documents segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create, enhance, annotate and securely send Adobe PDF files that can be shared, viewed, navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms. In addition, this segment provides server-based solutions for enterprises, in the areas of document generation, document process management, document collaboration, and document control and security. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision. Our services and support revenue is composed of professional services (such as consulting services and training) and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our Intelligent Documents server solution products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our professional services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and 39 enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Digital Imaging and Video $ 430.2 10 % $ 392.4 (5 )% $ 411.9 Percentage of total revenues 26 % 30 % 35 % Creative Professional 613.1 66 % 368.5 5 % 351.3 Percentage of total revenues 37 % 29 % 30 % Intelligent Documents 541.8 22 % 444.1 42 % 312.6 Percentage of total revenues 32 % 34 % 27 % OEM PostScript and Other 81.5 (9 )% 89.7 1 % 89.0 Percentage of total revenues 5 % 7 % 8 % Total revenues $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 11 % $ 1,164.8 Fiscal 2004 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2003 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to increases in revenues from both our digital video and digital imaging software products. Revenue from our digital video software products increased 9% during fiscal 2004 which was attributable to new releases during fiscal 2004. Revenue from our digital imaging software products increased 10% during fiscal 2004 due to continued success with Adobe Photoshop CS which was released at the end of fiscal 2003 as well as the release of Photoshop Elements 3.0 in fiscal 2004. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the continued strength of our Adobe Creative Suite products which were initially released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in revenues from our Adobe Creative Suite products were partially offset by decreases in revenues in our business and technical page layout software products due to product lifecycle timing. Revenue from our Intelligent Documents segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a 17% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products as a result of continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products launched in fiscal 2003. Additionally, revenue from our Intelligent Documents server-based products increased 50% due to increased licensing and server support revenue. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to a decline in pricing resulting from competition from clone PostScript technologies and lower prices of output devices. Revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue, but if the decline significantly exceeds our expectations, it may harm our future results. Fiscal 2003 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2002 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment decreased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products. Overall, we experienced a 7% decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products, which was mainly attributable to product lifecycle timing. With the introduction of Adobe Creative Suite, which includes Photoshop, we experienced a shift in revenue from Photoshop to the Adobe Creative Suite which is reported in the Creative Professional segment. The 7% decrease in revenues from our digital imaging software products was partially offset by an 8% increase in revenues from our digital video software products. The increase in revenues from our digital video software products was due primarily to new releases of Adobe Video Collection. 40 Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to a 57% increase in revenues from the release of new products during fiscal 2003, including the introduction of Adobe Creative Suite, as well as our professional page layout products. This increase was partially offset by decreases in revenues from our other products in the Creative Professional segment. Revenues from our business publishing products decreased 26% due to the planned migration of customers to our professional page layout products. Finally, revenues from our illustration, type and technical publishing, and Web publishing products decreased by 15%, which was primarily attributable to product lifecycle timing. Revenue from our Intelligent Documents segment increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to new releases of our Acrobat desktop products during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, as well as increased sales and marketing focus, enhanced corporate and government licensing programs, and product price increases. Overall we experienced a 37% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products, which was driven by continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products in government, financial services, manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction markets among others. Additionally, revenues from our Intelligent Documents segment increased due to a 79% increase in revenues from licensing of our Intelligent Documents server solution products and the professional services and support revenue associated with these products. The increase in revenue generated from the licensing of our Intelligent Documents server solution products and associated professional services and support was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Accelio during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment remained relatively stable during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. This was due to an increase in royalty revenues from our larger OEM customers during the first half of fiscal 2003. This increase was offset by a decline in revenues in the second half of the year due to weakness in the print business and smaller OEM customers moving to clone PostScript technologies. Geographic Information Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Americas $ 770.6 20 % $ 640.2 10 % $ 583.8 Percentage of total revenues 46 % 49 % 50 % EMEA 541.5 46 % 370.2 17 % 317.6 Percentage of total revenues 33 % 29 % 27 % Asia 354.5 25 % 284.3 8 % 263.4 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 22 % 23 % Total revenues $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 11 % $ 1,164.8 The increase in revenues, in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our Creative Professional products. The increase in revenues, in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our Intelligent Documents desktop products. Additionally, revenues in EMEA and Asia increased approximately $50.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, during fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 due to the strength of the euro and the yen. In fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, revenues in EMEA and Asia increased approximately $50.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively, due to the strength of the euro and the yen. 41 Platform Information Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Windows 73 % 74 % 71 % Macintosh 27 % 26 % 29 % We expect a growth trend towards the Windows platform over the long term due to our targeting of business users with our Intelligent Documents desktop products, where the majority of users run the Windows operating system. Inventory Information At the end of fiscal 2004 our channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows up to an estimated 4.5 weeks of anticipated product supply at our distributors. With regard to our product backlog, our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. For example, prior to the finalization and release of new products, we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases. At the end of fiscal 2004, we had significant levels of such backlog due to the announced, but yet to be completed and released new version of Acrobat and related products. Our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal 2004, other than those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those due to the application of our global channel inventory policy, was approximately 4% of reported fourth quarter fiscal 2004 revenue. The comparable backlog at the end of our third quarter fiscal 2004 was approximately 8% of third quarter fiscal 2004 revenue. Cost of Revenues Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Product $ 86.6 8 % $ 79.9 (18 )% $ 96.9 Percentage of total revenues 5 % 6 % 8 % Services and support 17.8 36 % 13.1 76 % 7.4 Percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % Total cost of revenues $ 104.4 12 % $ 93.0 (11 )% $ 104.3 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies, and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. In fiscal 2002, cost of product revenue also included hosted server costs associated with the Adobe DesignTeam. Cost of product revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to licensing costs as a result of litigation settlements that occurred in fiscal 2004 and an increase in localization costs related to our product launches. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in overall material costs. Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to product mix. During fiscal 2003, we received higher licensing revenue versus shrink-wrapped product revenue, compared to fiscal 2002, which resulted in lower material costs. Additionally, cost of product revenue for fiscal 2002 included the amortization and impairment costs associated with the Adobe DesignTeam, which was discontinued during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. 42 Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee-related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to costs associated with our Expert Support program that was initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Additionally, cost of services and support revenue increased due to compensation and related benefits as a result of higher headcount and incentive compensation related to increases in services and support activities in fiscal 2004. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to the acquisition of Accelio during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Operating Expenses Research and Development Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Expenses $ 311.3 12 % $ 277.0 13 % $ 246.1 Percentage of total revenues 19 % 21 % 21 % Research and development expenses consist principally of compensation and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses increased 8% during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation. The remaining increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2004 was due to various individually insignificant items. Research and development expenses increased 7% during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and increased 2% due to an accrual for major product releases. The remaining increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2003 was due to various individually insignificant items. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Expenses $ 521.1 23 % $ 423.4 11 % $ 380.4 Percentage of total revenues 31 % 33 % 33 % Sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support and order management. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. 43 Sales and marketing expenses increased 12% during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also increased 9% due to increased marketing spending related to overall marketing efforts to further increase revenues. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2004 was due to various individually insignificant items. Sales and marketing expenses increased 9% during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation. The remaining increase in sales and marketing expenses during fiscal 2003 was due to various individually insignificant items. General and Administrative Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Expenses $ 138.0 13 % $ 122.4 13 % $ 108.1 Percentage of total revenues 8 % 9 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses increased 10% due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation. General and administrative expenses also increased 3% due to higher professional fees. General and administrative expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation and 4% due to increased insurance costs. These increases were slightly offset by various individually insignificant items. Restructuring and Other Charges Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Expenses $ — * % $ (0.5 ) * % $ 12.1 Percentage of total revenues — * % 1 % * Percentage is not meaningful. We did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, we revised the accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we incurred a restructuring charge of $11.1 million, which included severance and related charges and the closure of a facility. The related restructuring program eliminated 239 engineering, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions worldwide in order to realign our resources for our future business plans. This restructuring plan was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. 44 In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate 39 redundant sales and marketing positions, held by Adobe employees worldwide, as a result of the acquisition of Accelio. The total restructuring charges, of $1.6 million, included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and the cost of vacating a leased facility. This restructuring plan was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in fiscal 2001. As a result, we revised the accrual by $0.6 million related to relocation, severance and other charges. Acquired In-Process Research and Development Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Expenses $ — — $ — * % $ 5.8 Percentage of total revenues — — * % * Percentage is not meaningful. We did not allocate any expenses to acquired in-process research and development in fiscal 2004 and 2003. In April 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Accelio, a provider of Web-enabled solutions that helped customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms. Based on a valuation analysis, $0.4 million was allocated to in-process research and development, which was expensed as of the date of the acquisition due to the state of the development of certain products and the uncertainty of the technology. In December 2001, we acquired Fotiva, a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage, store, enrich, and share digital photographs and other related personal media. Substantially all of Fotiva's assets were intellectual property. In connection with the acquisition, substantially all of the purchase price of $5.4 million cash was allocated to in-process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in-process state of the technology. Amortization and Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased and Other Intangibles Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Expenses $ — — $ — * % $ 21.0 Percentage of total revenues — — 2 % * Percentage is not meaningful. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (""SFAS 142""), ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized after fiscal 2002. Instead, the goodwill associated with past and any future acquisitions is reviewed annually for impairment. For further information, see Notes 1 and 5 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we assessed our goodwill for impairment. This assessment did not result in an impairment of goodwill. Amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased and other intangibles in fiscal 2002 included a goodwill impairment charge for the remaining book value of the Glassbook acquisition. 45 Non-operating Income (Loss) Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Investment gain (loss) $ 2.5 * % $ (12.9 ) 25 % $ (17.2 ) Percentage of total revenues * % (1 )% (1 )% Interest and other income 14.3 3 % 13.9 (6 )% 14.9 Percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % Total non-operating income (loss) $ 16.8 * % $ 1.0 * % $ (2.3 ) * Percentage is not meaningful. Investment Gain (Loss) Investment gain (loss) consists of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. During fiscal 2004, net investment gain primarily comprised gains from the sales of our short-term investments of $2.5 million. During fiscal 2003, net investment losses included net losses related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $12.0 million. This loss of $12.0 million was partially offset by gains of $3.1 million from the sale of our short-term investments. During fiscal 2003, investment losses also included write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of $4.0 million related to our short-term investments. During fiscal 2002, investment losses consisted of net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $13.1 million. We also recorded $11.3 million in losses related to other-than-temporary write-downs of our short-term investments. These losses were partially offset by gains totaling $7.2 million from the sale of our short-term investments. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies. Interest and Other Income The largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and interest expense. Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to higher levels of cash during fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, interest decreased by $0.4 million due to the lower interest rate environment in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. We also recognized $1.7 million less in realized gains on our fixed income portfolio. Those decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in other miscellaneous income. 46 Income Tax Provision Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 % Change 2003 to 2002 Fiscal 2002 Provision $ 158.2 39 % $ 114.1 22 % $ 93.3 Percentage of total revenues 10 % 9 % 8 % Effective tax rate 26 % 30.0 % 32.8 % Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 due to higher international profits which are taxed at a lower statutory rate. In fiscal 2002, the effective tax rate included a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of approximately 0.8%. On October 22, 2004, AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA introduced a limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. This deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company's chief executive officer and approved by the company's board of directors. Additionally, certain other criteria, as outlined in the AJCA, must also be met. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal 2005. We have started an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision. However, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the provision. In January 2005, the Treasury Department began to issue the first of a series of clarifying guidance documents related to this provision. We expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within the first two fiscal quarters of 2005. The range of possible amounts that we are considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500 million. While we estimate that the related potential range of additional income tax is between zero and $50 million, this estimation is subject to change following technical correction legislation that we believe is forthcoming from Congress. The amount of additional income tax would be reduced by the part of the eligible dividend that is attributable to foreign earnings on which a deferred tax liability had been previously accrued. 47 FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition. Adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results. If the economy worsens in any geographic areas where we do business, it would likely cause our future results to vary materially from our targets. A slower economy also may adversely affect our ability to grow. Political instability in any of the major countries in which we do business also may adversely affect our business. Delays in development or shipment of new products or major new versions of existing products could cause a decline in our revenue. Any delays or failures in developing and marketing our products, including upgrades of current products, may have a harmful impact on our results of operations. Our inability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect continued market acceptance of our products and our ability to develop new products. A portion of our future revenue will come from new applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect these delays or the introduction of new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations. Introduction of new products by existing and new competitors, particularly Microsoft, could harm our competitive position and results of operations. The end markets for our software products are intensely and increasingly competitive, and are significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors. Microsoft has an electronic form tool called InfoPath included as part of its latest professional Office product that competes with certain aspects of our Intelligent Documents product line. Given Microsoft's market dominance, InfoPath, or any new competitive Microsoft product or technology that is bundled as part of its Office product or operating system, could harm our overall Intelligent Documents market opportunity. In addition, Microsoft is developing the next generation of its Windows operating system, codenamed Longhorn. It is anticipated that Microsoft will add new electronic document capabilities to Longhorn, providing additional competition to our Intelligent Documents products and solutions. Also, some enterprise vendors provide intelligent document capabilities that could directly or indirectly compete with our Intelligent Documents products. Additionally, content creation/management tools that use other formats for electronic document distribution provide alternate solutions to customers, and indirectly compete with Adobe's Intelligent Documents products and the use of Adobe PDF. We also are seeing an increase in competition from clone PDF products marketed by other companies. Other competitors, including Microsoft, Apple and Google, may increase their presence in the digital imaging markets. We also face competition from certain Open Source products. Additionally, many digital camera manufacturers are bundling their own or our competitors' digital imaging and video software products with their digital camera products. If these competing products achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets. Any further consolidations among our competitors may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations. 48 If we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models or markets our results of operations could be negatively impacted. We are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for document generation, document process management, document collaboration, and document control and security. As a result, we are transitioning to new business models and seeking to broaden our customer base in the enterprise and government markets, requiring a considerable investment of technical, financial and sales resources, and a scaleable organization. Many of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper experience in the enterprise and government markets, and greater sales and marketing resources. It is our intent to form strategic alliances with leading enterprise and government solutions and service providers to provide additional resources to further enable penetration of the enterprise and government markets. If we are unable to successfully enter into strategic alliances, or if they are not as productive as we anticipate, our market penetration may not proceed as rapidly as we anticipate and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Our limited operating history with Adobe Creative Suite products makes it difficult to predict the revenue effect of the Adobe Creative Suite product cycle and the individual products integrated within these products. If we fail to anticipate and develop new products in response to changes in demand for application software, computers and printers our business could be harmed. We offer our application-based products primarily on Windows and Macintosh platforms and on some UNIX platforms. We generally offer our server-based products, but not desktop application products, on the Linux platform as well as the Windows and UNIX platforms. To the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers on either the Windows or Macintosh platform or in general, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on the Linux desktop platform before we choose and are able to offer our products on this platform, our business could be harmed. We may incur substantial costs enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings. In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party rights, including but not limited to patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results, including subjecting us to significant liabilities, requiring us to seek licenses from others, preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, any one of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, although we actively pursue software pirates as part of our enforcement of our intellectual property rights, we do lose revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities increase, it may further harm our business. 49 We rely on distributors to sell our products and any adverse change in our relationship with our distributors could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business. We distribute our application products primarily through distributors, resellers, retailers and increasingly systems integrators, ISVs and VARs (collectively referred to as ""distributors""). A significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Tech Data Corporation. In addition, our channel program focuses our efforts on larger distributors, which has resulted in our dependence on a relatively small number of distributors licensing a large amount of our products. Our distributors also sell our competitors' products, and if they favor our competitors' products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. In addition, the financial health of these distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in business conditions. Our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakens. If our internal computer network and applications suffer disruptions or fail to operate as designed our operations will be disrupted and our business may be harmed. We rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. The hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures and other similar events. They are also subject to acts such as computer viruses, physical or electronic vandalism or other similar disruptions also could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. We have developed disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, as they could impact our sales and damage our reputation and the reputation of our products. Any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could result in disruption in our business operations, loss of revenues or damage to our reputation. We rely on turnkey assemblers and any adverse change in our relationship with our turnkey assemblers could result in a loss of revenue and harm our business. We currently rely on six turnkey assemblers of our products, with at least two turnkeys located in each major region we serve. If any significant turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us, or if our supply from any significant turnkey assembler is interrupted or terminated for any other reason, we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products replicated by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and as a result the market price of our common stock may be volatile and our stock price could decline. As a result of a variety of factors discussed herein, our quarterly revenues and operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict. Our revenues may grow at a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and, in particular periods, may decline. Additionally, we periodically provide operating model targets for revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating margin, other income, tax rate, share count and earnings per share. These targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions about product pricing and demand, economic and seasonal trends, manufacturing costs and volumes, the mix of shrink-wrap and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, distribution channels and geographic markets. If one or more of these assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. 50 Due to the factors noted above, our future earnings and stock price may be subject to volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade compared to analysts' or investors' expectations has caused and could cause in the future an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock. Finally, we participate in a highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to us, changes in analysts' earnings estimates for us or our industry, and factors affecting the corporate environment, our industry, or the securities markets in general, will often result in volatility of our common stock price. We are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business. We generate over 50% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas. Sales to these customers subject us to a number of risks, including (i) foreign currency fluctuations, (ii) changes in government preferences for software procurement, (iii) international economic and political conditions, (iv) unexpected changes in, or impositions of, international legislative or regulatory requirements, (v) inadequate local infrastructure, (vi) delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions, (vii) transportation delays, (viii) the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, and other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and diseases. If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted. We may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure. Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our judgment. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting rules and regulations, such as expensing of stock options, could result in unfavorable accounting charges. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows: •software revenue recognition •accounting for share-based payments •accounting for income taxes •accounting for business combinations and related goodwill In particular, the FASB recently enacted SFAS 123R which will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our business. 51 Changes in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of revenue or earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Any adverse outcome from these continuous examinations may have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We may suffer losses from our equity investments which could harm our business. We hold equity investments in public companies that have experienced significant declines in market value. We also have investments and may continue to make future investments in privately held companies, many of which are considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the market for the technologies or products these companies have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our investment activities can impact our net income. Future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long-term declines in value of any of our investments could reduce our net income in future periods. We are uncertain about future investment gains and losses, as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies. If we are unable to recruit and retain skilled personnel our business may be harmed. Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of our employees are located. We have relied on our ability to grant equity compensation as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining such highly skilled personnel. Recently enacted accounting regulations requiring the expensing of equity compensation may impair our ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS Option Program Description Our stock option program is a long-term retention program that is intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We consider our stock option program critical to our operation and productivity; essentially all of our employees participate. Option vesting periods are generally three years for all of the plans within our stock option program. For further information regarding our stock option program, see Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All stock option grants to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Executive Compensation Committee are independent directors, as defined in the current rules applicable to issuers traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. See the ""Report of the Executive Compensation Committee"" appearing in our 2005 Proxy Statement for further information concerning the policies and procedures, of the Company and the Executive Compensation Committee, regarding the use of stock options for executive officers. 52 In May 2003, a stock option exchange program was initiated that allowed eligible employees to exchange options granted with an option price greater than $40.00 per share for a lesser number of new options, according to specified exchange ratios. The program excluded executive officers and members of our Board of Directors. The cancellation date for the program was June 16, 2003. We accepted for cancellation, options to purchase approximately 7.1 million shares of common stock. On December 17, 2003, eligible employees received new options to purchase approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock, in exchange for such cancelled options, with an exercise price of $39.10. Distribution and Dilutive Effect of Options The table below provides information about stock options granted for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 to our Chief Executive Officer and our four other most highly compensated executive officers as of December 3, 2004. This group is referred to as the Named Executive Officers. Please refer to the section below, headed ""Named Executive Officer Option Grants,"" for the Named Executive Officers. Options granted to employees, directors and Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2002 through 2004 are summarized as follows(†): 2004 2003 2002 Net grants during the period as % of outstanding shares 4 % (3 )% 3 % Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of total options granted 9 % 0 % 21 % Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of outstanding shares * % 0 % 1 % Cumulative options held by Named Executive Officers as % of total options outstanding 16 % 16 % 15 % †""Net grants"" equals the sum of the number of shares subject to options granted to all employees, directors and Named Executive Officers during the specified period reduced by the number of shares subject to options which were canceled or otherwise terminated during such period. Net grants during fiscal 2004 reflect the new options granted in exchange for options cancelled under our stock option exchange program in fiscal 2003. Net grants during fiscal 2003 reflect the cancellation of options under our stock option exchange program. Net grants as a percentage of outstanding shares are based on 242.2 million shares, 238.3 million shares and 232.0 million shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 3, 2004, November 28, 2003 and November 29, 2002 respectively. *Less than 1%. For additional information about our employee stock option plan activity, and pro forma earnings presentation as if we had accounted for our grant of employee stock options using the fair value method of accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (""SFAS No. 123""), ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" refer to Notes 1 and 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Options granted to the Named Executive Officers as a percentage of the total options granted to all employees and directors vary from year to year. For additional information about the compensation of our executive officers and stock option grants to our Named Executive Officers, refer to our 2005 Proxy Statement we will deliver to our stockholders in connection with our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 28, 2005. 53 General Option Information The following table sets forth the summary of option activity under our stock option program for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002: Outstanding Options Options Available for Grant Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price November 30, 2001 12,818,238 54,284,317 $ 36.66 Granted (11,973,680 ) 11,973,680 28.77 Exercised — (3,688,534 ) 15.99 Canceled 4,722,413 (4,722,413 ) 45.20 November 29, 2002 5,566,971 57,847,050 35.64 Granted (1,994,130 ) 1,994,130 33.12 Exercised — (7,978,054 ) 23.81 Canceled 9,388,535 (9,393,473 ) 58.00 Expired (8,006 ) — — November 28, 2003 12,953,370 42,469,653 32.80 Granted (10,379,755 ) 10,379,755 42.13 Exercised — (13,293,864 ) 27.10 Canceled 1,289,228 (1,289,228 ) 40.91 Expired (9,259 ) — — Increased authorization 4,500,000 — — December 3, 2004 8,353,584 38,266,316 $ 37.04 The following table sets forth a comparison, as of December 3, 2004, of the number of shares subject to our options whose exercise prices were at or below the closing price of our common stock on December 3, 2004 (""In-the-Money"" options) to the number of shares subject to options whose exercise prices were greater than the closing price of our common stock on such date (""Out-of-the-Money"" options): Exercisable Unexercisable Total Percentage of Total Options Outstanding In-the-Money(*) 19,358,902 15,829,275 35,188,177 92 % Out-of-the-Money(*) 3,077,805 334 3,078,139 8 % Total Options Outstanding 22,436,707 15,829,609 38,266,316 100 % (*)The closing price of our common stock was $62.96 on December 3, 2004, as reported by the Nasdaq National Market. 54 Named Executive Officer Option Grants The following table sets forth information regarding stock options granted during fiscal 2004, to our Named Executive Officers.

Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004 of $683.7 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation costs. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections. Our days sales outstanding in trade receivables (""DSO"") decreased from 37 days at November 28, 2003 to 30 days at December 3, 2004. Working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2003 of $433.1 million primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses, and increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs, sales and marketing programs, legal fees and accruals for major product releases. Income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations. These increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges. The increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year and the launch of our new Creative Suites and related CS products at the end of the year. The decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs. During fiscal 2002, cash provided by operating activities of $329.3 million was primarily due to net income, net of non-cash related expenses, an increase in income taxes payable and deferred revenue 56 and a decrease in accounts receivable. Income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations. The decrease in trade receivables was primarily due to our improved collections during fiscal 2002. These increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease in accrued restructuring charges and accrued expenses. Accrued restructuring charges decreased primarily due to the payment of severance and related charges. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation related costs. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2004 of $276.6 million decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2003 of $548.4 million due primarily to lower net purchases of short-term investments as compared to the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2003 increased from cash used in fiscal 2002 of $142.3 million, primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments. The increase in purchases of short-term investments is attributable to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds from the re-issuance of treasury stock during fiscal 2003. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 of $224.5 million increased from the cash provided in fiscal 2003 of $117.0 million primarily due to repurchases of stock. Cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2004 increased from fiscal 2003 due to a higher average cost per share, a higher number of shares being repurchased, and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements. The cost of the repurchases was partially offset by proceeds received from employees exercising their stock options. The increase in proceeds received is due to a higher number of options being exercised as well as higher option exercise prices. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2003 increased from cash used in fiscal 2002 of $223.3 million as more employees exercised their stock options during fiscal 2003 due to higher stock prices. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of 1988. Adobe's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0125 per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal 2002 through 2004. Under the terms of our lease agreements for our San Jose headquarters, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs. The declaration of future dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of Adobe's Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, and other factors. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Adobe uses highly regarded investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms actively managed 90% of Adobe's invested balances during the year. The fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds within the U.S. and in highly rated corporate and sovereign obligations outside of the U.S. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. All investments are made according to guidelines and within compliance of policies approved by the Board of Directors. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2005 in the event of weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in the section ""Factors That May Affect Future Performance."" Also, while we currently have no committed lines of credit, we 57 believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market, if required. Stock Repurchase Program I—On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program designed to minimize dilution from stock issuance primarily from employee stock plans, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. Historically we have sold put warrants and purchased call options. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5(c) in this filing for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 3, 2004. During fiscal 2004, we entered into several stock purchase agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, we provided the financial institutions with up-front payments totaling $350.0 million. The financial institutions agreed to deliver to us, at certain intervals during the contract term, a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount. Upon payment, the $350.0 million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. These contracts will expire on or before May 17, 2005. On December 20, 2004, we entered into several additional stock purchase agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, we provided the financial institutions with up-front payments totaling $100.0 million. The financial institutions agreed to deliver to us, at certain intervals during the contract term, a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount. Upon payment, the $100.0 million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. These contracts will expire on or before June 21, 2005. Stock Repurchase Program II—Additional Authorization above Dilution Coverage In March 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period, subject to certain business and cash flow requirements. The program expired on March 2, 2003. On September 25, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a three-year period, subject to certain business and cash flow requirements. The authorization for this program will expire in September 2005. The tables below represent our authorized stock repurchase plans and summary of stock repurchases as of December 3, 2004.

See ""Stock Repurchase Program I—On-going Dilution Coverage"" above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 3, 2004, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments The two lease agreements discussed in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of December 3, 2004 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. We expect to remain within compliance in the next 12 months. We are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our lease commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of December 3, 2004: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income $ 123.1 $ 28.5 $ 40.2 $ 30.0 $ 24.4 Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. 59 We have commitments to make certain milestone and/or retention payments typically entered into in conjunction with various acquisitions, for which we have made accruals in our consolidated financial statements. In connection with certain acquisitions and purchases of technology assets during fiscal 2003 and 2004, we entered into employee retention agreements and are required to make payments upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the agreements. These costs are being amortized over the retention period to compensation expense. As of December 3, 2004, we have $1.6 million remaining to be paid under our retention agreements. As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income, was approximately $15.9 million, $14.5 million and $14.4 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other Information Consistent with Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are responsible for listing the audit and non-audit services pre-approved in the fourth quarter of 2004 by our Audit Committee to be performed by KPMG LLP, our external auditor. Each of the permitted non-audit services has been pre-approved by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee's Chairman pursuant to delegated authority by the Audit Committee, other than de minimus non-audit services for which the pre-approval requirements are waived in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Audit Committee pre-approved the following non-audit services anticipated to be performed by KPMG LLP: 1) foreign financial statement review and 2) tax audit and compliance services. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in foreign countries, in U.S. dollars and in various foreign currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from 60 movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen-denominated product and support revenue in Japan and euro-denominated product and support revenue in certain European countries. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, our exposures were 24.1 billion yen, 21.3 billion yen and 20.5 billion yen, respectively. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, our exposures were 375.4 million euros, 274.0 million euros and 288.5 million euros, respectively. In addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional foreign subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ending December 3, 2004 and November 28, 2003 this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $40.1 million and $30.8 million, respectively. At this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen, and our European operating expenses are primarily in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. At December 3, 2004, total outstanding contracts included the notional equivalent of $110.9 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of $221.6 million. As of December 3, 2004, all contracts were set to expire at various times through June 2005. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational (""cash flow"") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 3, 2004, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. The critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions. The changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions. We record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income. The time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income (loss) over the life of the contract. See also Note 16 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 61 Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 3, 2004, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 3, 2004. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $14.8 million and $27.7 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $9.4 million and $14.1 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. See also Note 16 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of December 3, 2004, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $2.8 million compared to $7.2 million at November 28, 2003, a decrease of 61%. The decrease was due to sales of $2.4 million and a $2.0 million decrease in market value adjustment. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each company's cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write-down in our consolidated statements of income. 62 The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35%, and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. 50% 35% 15% Marketable equity securities $ (1.4 ) $ (1.0 ) $ (0.4 ) Fixed Income Investments At December 3, 2004, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $1,272.8 million compared to $1,069.0 million at November 28, 2003, an increase of 19%. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. The table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. Less than one year $ 773.8 One year to two years 315.2 Greater than two years 183.8 Total $ 1,272.8 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 3, 2004. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (2.5 ) $ (6.8 ) $ (10.1 ) 12 month horizon $ (1.9 ) $ (4.0 ) $ (5.8 ) We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time, the maximum weighted average duration of all portfolios is limited to 2.2 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Due to limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material. Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. It is our policy to review privately-held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on 63 information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies.

ACQUISITION OF MACROMEDIA On December 3, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Macromedia for approximately $3.4 billion. We expect the acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We expect our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future, but we also anticipate cost saving synergies. In addition, we expect to incur estimated restructuring charges of $20 million to $25 million in the next fiscal year, primarily in the first quarter. Coinciding with the integration of Macromedia and the start of our 2006 fiscal year, we changed the reporting of our principal business segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our various businesses. The discussions in this section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the financial statements contained herein, relate to Adobe as a standalone entity and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by high-end consumers, creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs; direct to end users; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-personal computer platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates 43 with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see the discussion in the section titled ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" below and Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change. Our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions, if any, must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. 44 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123—revised 2004 (""SFAS 123R""), ""Share-Based Payment"" which replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (""SFAS 123""), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 (""APB 25""), ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."" SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income. In April 2005, the SEC announced that the accounting provisions of SFAS 123R are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, we are now required to adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and will recognize stock-based compensation expense using the modified prospective method. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts as if we had used a fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. We are evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share. See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2005 During fiscal 2005, we continued to focus on delivering comprehensive technology platforms to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth. In our Intelligent Document business, we achieved year-over-year growth primarily due to our Acrobat 7.0 family of products which began shipping in the first quarter. Acrobat 7.0 has numerous new features to help drive increased adoption by users in enterprises, governments and specialized vertical markets such as architecture, engineering and construction. We also achieved year-over-year growth in our Creative Professional business due primarily to the release of version 2 of our Adobe Creative Suite products beginning in the second quarter of the fiscal year. Creative Suite 2.0 integrates new full-versions of Adobe's design and publishing software, along with Version Cue CS2 and a new visual file browser called Adobe Bridge. Beginning in fiscal 2004, many customers began licensing Photoshop capabilities via the Creative Suite products, as opposed to licensing the standalone version of the product. This planned migration has impacted the revenues from our Digital Imaging and Video business segment. However, our total revenue in the Digital Imaging and Video business grew in fiscal 2005 due to the strength of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements software bundle, new versions of which were released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Product $ 1,923.3 18 % $ 1,634.0 29 % $ 1,269.0 Percentage of total revenues 98 % 98 % 98 % Services and support 43.0 32 % 32.6 27 % 25.7 Percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Total revenues $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 In fiscal 2005, we had four reportable segments: Digital Imaging and Video, Creative Professional, Intelligent Document, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Digital Imaging and Video segment provides 45 users with software for creating, editing, enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs, digital video, audio and animations. The Creative Professional segment provides software for professional page layout, professional Web page layout, graphic and illustration creation, technical document publishing and business publishing. Additionally, this segment includes Photoshop and Acrobat Professional as part of its Adobe Creative Suite products. The Intelligent Document segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create, enhance, annotate and securely send Adobe PDF files that can be shared, viewed, navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms. In addition, this segment provides server-based solutions for enterprises, in the areas of document generation, document process management, document collaboration, and document control and security. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision. Our services and support revenue is composed of professional services (such as consulting services and training) and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our Intelligent Document server solution products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our professional services revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Segment Information Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Digital Imaging and Video $ 432.8 1 % $ 430.2 10 % $ 392.4 Percentage of total revenues 22 % 26 % 30 % Creative Professional 743.8 21 % 613.1 66 % 368.5 Percentage of total revenues 38 % 37 % 29 % Intelligent Document 708.0 31 % 541.8 22 % 444.1 Percentage of total revenues 36 % 32 % 34 % OEM PostScript and Other 81.7 — % 81.5 (9 )% 89.7 Percentage of total revenues 4 % 5 % 7 % Total revenues $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 with the completion of our acquisition of Macromedia, we changed the reporting of our business segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our combined businesses. Our new business segments are Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions, Enterprise and Developer Solutions, Mobile and Device Solutions, and Other. The management discussion and analysis that follows is based on the segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment grew slightly for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The growth in the segment was due to the 3% increase in revenues from our digital imaging software products as a result of new releases of our Adobe Photoshop Elements product as well as the new software bundle that combines our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 32% increase in revenues from the new versions of our Adobe Creative Suite 46 products which were released during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Intelligent Document segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 36% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products. The increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products is due to continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products by enterprises and technical professionals, as well as the release of Acrobat 7.0 during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Intelligent Document LiveCycle products increased approximately 10% during fiscal 2005 due to increased licensing and server support revenue, as we continue to focus on both the government sector and financial services. Additionally, revenue from our Intelligent Document segment increased during fiscal 2005 due to an increase in consulting revenues. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment remained relatively flat during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue. Fiscal 2004 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2003 Revenue Revenue from our Digital Imaging and Video segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to increases in revenues from both our digital video and digital imaging software products. Revenue from our digital video software products increased 9% during fiscal 2004 which was attributable to new releases during fiscal 2004. Revenue from our digital imaging software products increased 10% during fiscal 2004 due to continued success with Adobe Photoshop CS which was released at the end of fiscal 2003 as well as the release of Photoshop Elements 3.0 in fiscal 2004. Revenue from our Creative Professional segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the continued strength of our Adobe Creative Suite products which were initially released in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in revenues from our Adobe Creative Suite products were partially offset by decreases in revenues in our business and technical page layout software products due to product lifecycle timing. Revenue from our Intelligent Document segment increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a 17% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products as a result of continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products launched in fiscal 2003. Additionally, revenue from our Intelligent Document server-based products increased 50% due to increased licensing and server support revenue. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to a decline in pricing resulting from competition from clone PostScript technologies and lower prices of output devices. Geographic Information Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Americas $ 939.7 22 % $ 770.6 20 % $ 640.2 Percentage of total revenues 48 % 46 % 49 % EMEA 612.7 13 % 541.5 46 % 370.2 Percentage of total revenues 31 % 33 % 29 % Asia 413.9 17 % 354.5 25 % 284.3 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 21 % 22 % Total revenues $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 29 % $ 1,294.7 47 Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Digital Imaging and Video, Creative Professional and Intelligent Document products. Revenue in EMEA and Asia increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Creative Professional and Intelligent Document products. The increase in revenues, in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our Creative Professional products. Additionally, due to the strength of the euro and the yen, revenues in EMEA and Asia increased approximately $15.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, during fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 and increased $50.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, during fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003. Platform Information Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Windows 75 % 73 % 74 % Macintosh 25 % 27 % 26 % We expect a growth trend towards the Windows platform over the long term due to our targeting of business users with our Intelligent Document desktop products, where the majority of users run the Windows operating system. Inventory Information At the end of fiscal 2005 our overall channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows, on an overall basis, up to 4.5 weeks of anticipated total product supply at our distributors. With regard to our product backlog, our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. For example, prior to the finalization and release of new products, we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases. Our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal 2005, other than those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those due to the application of our global channel inventory policy, was approximately 8% of fourth quarter fiscal 2005 revenue. The comparable backlog at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2005 was approximately 2% of third quarter fiscal 2005 revenue. Cost of Revenues Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Product $ 90.0 4 % $ 86.6 8 % $ 79.9 Percentage of total revenues 5 % 5 % 6 % Services and support 22.6 27 % 17.8 36 % 13.1 Percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % Total cost of revenues $ 112.6 8 % $ 104.4 12 % $ 93.0 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue increased 5% during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to material costs related to higher shrink-wrap revenue, 3% due to an increase in our localization costs related to our 48 product launches, 2% related to royalties for licensed technologies, 1% related to excess and obsolete inventory and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by an 8% decrease in cost of product revenue due to a one time charge related to a litigation settlement that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The remaining 1% increase in cost of product revenue for fiscal 2005 was due to various individually insignificant items. Cost of product revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to licensing costs as a result of litigation settlements that occurred in fiscal 2004 and an increase in localization costs related to our product launches. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in overall material costs. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee-related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to increases in headcount related expenses, including higher compensation and related benefits, as well as outsourced consulting fees. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to costs associated with our Expert Support program that was initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Additionally, cost of services and support revenue increased due to compensation and related benefits as a result of higher headcount and incentive compensation related to increases in services and support activities in fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses Research and Development Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ 365.3 17 % $ 311.3 12 % $ 277.0 Percentage of total revenues 19 % 19 % 21 % Research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2005 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 10 % 8 % Increased use of contractors 1 — Increased purchases of equipment and software licenses 2 — Various individually insignificant items 4 4 Total change 17 % 12 % We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our software products. 49 Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ 593.3 14 % $ 521.1 23 % $ 423.4 Percentage of total revenues 30 % 31 % 33 % Sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2005 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 7 % 12 % Increased marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenues 4 9 Various individually insignificant items 3 2 Total change 14 % 23 % General and Administrative Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ 166.7 21 % $ 138.0 13 % $ 122.4 Percentage of total revenues 8 % 8 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2005 to 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation 8 % 10 % Increased professional fees 6 3 Increased depreciation and amortization 3 — Increased repairs and maintenance 2 — Decreased legal fees (2 ) — Various individually insignificant items 4 — Total change 21 % 13 % 50 Restructuring and Other Charges Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Expenses $ — — % $ — * % $ (0.5 ) Percentage of total revenues — — * % * Percentage is not meaningful. We did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2005 and 2004. During fiscal 2003, we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, we revised the accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities. Non-operating Income Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Investment gain (loss) $ (1.3 ) * % $ 2.5 * % $ (12.9 ) Percentage of total revenues * % * % (1 )% Interest and other income 38.6 * % 14.3 3 % 13.9 Percentage of total revenues 2 % 1 % 1 % Total non-operating income $ 37.3 * % $ 16.8 * % $ 1.0 * Percentage is not meaningful. Investment Gain (Loss) Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. 2005 2004 2003 Net losses related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ (1.0 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (12.0 ) Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (0.6 ) — (4.0 ) Gains from sale of short-term investments 0.1 2.5 3.1 Gains on stock warrants 0.2 0.1 — Total investment gain (loss) $ (1.3 ) $ 2.5 $ (12.9 ) We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies. Interest and Other Income The largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transactions including hedging gains and losses, and interest expense. 51 Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and higher interest rates during fiscal 2005, as well as higher gains on our foreign currency hedging program. Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due to higher levels of cash during fiscal 2004. Income Tax Provision Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Provision $ 162.9 3 % $ 158.2 39 % $ 114.1 Percentage of total revenues 8 % 10 % 9 % Effective tax rate 21 % 26 % 30 % Our effective tax rate decreased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to a $29.3 million tax benefit recognized for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-2 (""FAS 109-2""), ""Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (""AJCA"")."" See Note 1 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding FAS 109-2. The net tax benefit includes a $72.8 million reversal for taxes on foreign earnings for which a deferred tax liability had been previously accrued. In addition, our effective tax rate decreased 1 percentage point due to a variety of factors, including higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate and a reduction of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 due to higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTIONS Option Program Description Our stock option program is a long-term retention program that is intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We consider our stock option program critical to our operation and productivity; essentially all of our employees participate. Option vesting periods are generally three years for all of the plans within our stock option program. For further information regarding our stock option program, see Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All stock option grants to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Executive Compensation Committee are independent directors, as defined in the rules applicable to issuers traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. See the ""Report of the Executive Compensation Committee"" appearing in our 2006 Proxy Statement for further information concerning the policies and procedures, of Adobe and the Executive Compensation Committee, regarding the use of stock options for executive officers. 52 Distribution and Dilutive Effect of Options The table below provides information about stock options granted for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 to our Chief Executive Officer and our four other most highly compensated executive officers. This group is referred to as the Named Executive Officers. Options granted to employees, directors and Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2003 through 2005 are summarized as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Net grants† during the period as % of outstanding shares 2 % 4 % (3 )% Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of total options granted 12 % 9 % 0 % Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of outstanding shares * % * % 0 % Cumulative options held by Named Executive Officers as % of total options outstanding 15 % 16 % 16 % †""Net grants"" equals the sum of the number of shares subject to options granted to all employees, directors and Named Executive Officers during the specified period reduced by the number of shares subject to options which were canceled or otherwise terminated during such period. Net grants during fiscal 2004 reflect the new options granted in exchange for options cancelled under our stock option exchange program in fiscal 2003. Net grants during fiscal 2003 reflect the cancellation of options under our stock option exchange program. Net grants as a percentage of outstanding shares are based on 488.7 million shares, 484.4 million shares and 476.6 million shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 2, 2005, December 3, 2004 and November 28, 2003 respectively. *Less than 1%. For additional information about our employee stock option plan activity and pro forma earnings presentation as if we had accounted for our grant of employee stock options using the fair value method of accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (""SFAS No. 123""), ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" refer to Notes 1 and 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Options granted to the Named Executive Officers as a percentage of the total options granted to all employees and directors vary from year to year. For additional information about the compensation of our executive officers and stock option grants to our Named Executive Officers, refer to our 2006 Proxy Statement we will deliver to our stockholders in connection with our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on March 28, 2006. 53 General Option Information The following table sets forth the summary of option activity under our stock option program for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003: Outstanding Options Options Available for Grant Number of Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price November 29, 2002 11,133,942 115,694,100 $ 17.82 Granted (3,988,260 ) 3,988,260 16.56 Exercised — (15,956,108 ) 11.91 Canceled 18,777,070 (18,786,946 ) 29.00 Expired (16,012 ) — — November 28, 2003 25,906,740 84,939,306 16.40 Granted (20,759,510 ) 20,759,510 21.07 Exercised — (26,587,728 ) 13.55 Canceled 2,578,456 (2,578,456 ) 20.46 Expired (18,518 ) — — Increased authorization 9,000,000 — — December 3, 2004 16,707,168 76,532,632 18.52 Granted (11,418,499 ) 11,418,499 31.88 Exercised — (20,494,162 ) 15.32 Canceled 2,205,685 (2,205,685 ) 21.52 Increased authorization 16,800,000 — — December 2, 2005 24,294,354 65,251,284 $ 21.76 The following table sets forth a comparison, as of December 2, 2005, of the number of shares subject to our options whose exercise prices were at or below the closing price of our common stock on December 2, 2005 (""In-the-Money"" options) to the number of shares subject to options whose exercise prices were greater than the closing price of our common stock on such date (""Out-of-the-Money"" options): Exercisable Unexercisable Total Percentage of Total Options Outstanding In-the-Money* 41,989,006 23,152,478 65,141,484 100 % Out-of-the-Money* 109,800 — 109,800 † % Total Options Outstanding 42,098,806 23,152,478 65,251,284 100 % *The closing price of our common stock was $34.97 on December 2, 2005, as reported by the Nasdaq National Market. †Less than 1% 54 Equity Compensation Plan Information The following table gives information about our common stock that may be issued under our existing equity compensation plans as of December 2, 2005: Plan Category Number of Securities to Be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options (a) Weighted Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options (b) Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a)) (c) Equity compensation plans approved by stockholders 65,251,284 $ 21.76 52,533,618* *Includes 5.5 million shares and 22.8 million shares, respectively, which are reserved for issuance under the 1994 Performance and Restricted Stock Plan and the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of December 2, 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 % Change 2004 to 2003 Fiscal 2003 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 1,700.8 30 % $ 1,313.2 20 % $ 1,096.5 Working capital 1,528.2 38 % 1,107.1 24 % 892.5 Stockholders' equity $ 1,864.3 31 % $ 1,423.5 29 % $ 1,100.8 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll (salaries, bonuses, and benefits), general operating expenses (marketing, travel, office rent) and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. In fiscal 2005, we reclassified all auction rate securities and variable rate demand obligations to short-term investments pursuant to an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 (""SFAS 95""), ""Statement of Cash Flows"" relating to the definition of cash equivalents. This interpretation and subsequent reclassification has resulted in a presentation of our consolidated balance sheet that may understate the true liquidity of our fixed income portfolio. As of December 2, 2005, $158.2 million of the securities now classified as short-term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within 90 days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005, of $730.4 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs and marketing expenses. Income taxes payable increased as a result of higher current tax liabilities related to repatriation of certain foreign earnings and overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period. As compared to fiscal 2004, our days sales outstanding in trade receivables (""DSO"") was 31 days, one day higher than fiscal 2004. Other current assets increased due to an increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to acquisition costs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004, of $683.7, million primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable. Accrued expenses increased primarily 55 due to compensation related costs. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections. Our trade DSO decreased from 37 days at November 28, 2003 to 30 days at December 3, 2004. Working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2003, of $433.1 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses, and increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs, sales and marketing programs, legal fees and accruals for major product releases. Income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations. These increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges. The increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year and the launch of our new Creative Suites and related CS products at the end of the year. The decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 of $320.4 million decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2004 of $330.3 million because there was not an investment in a lease receivable (related to our corporate headquarter office buildings) in 2005 as there was in 2004. This was partially offset by higher net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2005. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2004 decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2003 of $577.8 million due primarily to lower net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2004. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 of $246.6 million increased from cash used in fiscal 2004 of $224.5 million primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the re-issuance of treasury stock as a result of a lower number of options being exercised. Cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2004 increased from the cash provided in fiscal 2003 of $117.0 million primarily due to repurchases of stock. Cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2004 increased from fiscal 2003 due to a higher average cost per share, a higher number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements (see the section titled ""Stock Repurchase Program I—On-Going Dilution""). We discontinued our quarterly cash dividend after the payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Under the terms of our lease agreements for our San Jose headquarters, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. Adobe uses professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 88% of Adobe's invested balances during fiscal 2005. Within the U.S., the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury notes and other sovereign obligations, and highly rated corporate notes. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. All investments are made according to policies approved by the Board of Directors. During fiscal 2005, we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the AJCA and repatriated $558.3 million of certain foreign earnings. The effect of the repatriation was to increase liquidity in the United States with a corresponding reduction in liquidity in foreign subsidiaries. We expect 56 that our foreign subsidiaries will have sufficient positive cash flow from operations to meet ongoing liquidity needs over the next 12 months. Further information regarding the tax effects of the AJCA can be found in Note 8 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2006 in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in the section entitled ""Business—Risk Factors."" Also, while we currently have no committed lines of credit, we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market, if required. Acquisition of Macromedia On December 3, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Macromedia, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, which was approved by the boards of directors and the stockholders of both companies, Macromedia stockholders received, at a fixed exchange ratio, 1.38 shares of Adobe common stock for every share of Macromedia common stock in a tax-free exchange. This fixed exchange ratio gives effect to the two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on May 23, 2005 to the stockholders of Adobe. We expect to incur significant incremental costs, such as direct costs related to the acquisition and costs associated with restructuring our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash outlays. Stock Repurchase Program I—On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5(c) in this report for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2005. During fiscal 2005, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, we provided the financial institutions with up-front payments totaling $600.0 million. The financial institutions agreed to deliver to us, at certain intervals during the contract term, a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount. Upon payment, the $600.0 million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. As of December 2, 2005, approximately $154.9 million of the up-front payments remained under the agreements which expired on December 22, 2005. On April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of $1.0 billion for stock repurchase commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. At the beginning of our fiscal 2006, we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions. Under these agreements, we provided the financial institutions with up-front payments totaling $500.0 million. The financial institutions agreed to deliver to us, at certain intervals during the contract term, a certain number of shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount. The $500.0 million will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. 57 Stock Repurchase Program II—Additional Authorization above Dilution Coverage On September 25, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of our common stock over a three-year period, subject to certain business and cash flow requirements. We have not made any purchases under this 10.0 million share repurchase program. The authorization for this program expired in September 2005. Summary of Stock Repurchases for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands, except average amounts) 2005 2004 2003 Repurchases Under the Plan Board Approval Date Shares Average Shares Average Shares Average December 1997 From employees(1) 7 $ 29.16 10 $ 25.65 36 $ 17.50 Open market — — 12,414 20.82 2,370 16.48 Option exercises(2) — — — — 3,168 14.23 Structured repurchases(3) 18,708 30.61 9,532 23.33 — — Total shares 18,715 $ 30.61 21,956 $ 21.91 5,574 $ 15.21 Total cost $ 572,930 $ 481,075 $ 84,777 (1)The repurchases from employees represent shares canceled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 2, 2005, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments The two lease agreements discussed in Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of December 2, 2005 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. We expect to remain within compliance in the next 12 months. We are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. See Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our lease commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of December 2, 2005: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income $ 160.4 $ 29.9 $ 44.9 $ 27.2 $ 58.4 58 Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue and are not included in the table above. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income, was approximately $17.8 million, $15.9 million and $14.5 million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations, however, as of December 2, 2005 all such obligations were immaterial. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in foreign countries, in U.S. dollars and in various foreign currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen-denominated product and support revenue in Japan and euro-denominated product and support revenue in certain European countries. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, our revenue exposures were 26.4 billion yen, 24.1 billion yen and 21.3 billion yen, respectively. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, our revenue exposures were 411.4 million euros, 375.4 million euros and 274.0 million euros, respectively. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen and our European operating expenses are primarily in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. At December 2, 2005, total outstanding contracts were $339.3 million which included the 59 notional equivalent of $133.0 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and the notional equivalent of $206.3 million in put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of December 2, 2005, all contracts were set to expire at various times through April 2006. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ending December 2, 2005 and December 3, 2004 this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $56.7 million and $40.1 million, respectively. At this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use option foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational (""cash flow"") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2005, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 2, 2005, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 150 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2005. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $26.2 million and $39.9 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $16.9 million and $22.1 million, respectively. 60 We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. See also Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of December 2, 2005, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $1.8 million compared to $2.8 million at December 3, 2004, a decrease of 34%. The decrease was due to sales of $1.2 million and $0.6 million write-downs due to an other-than-temporary decline in value of our marketable equity securities offset by an increase of $0.8 in market value adjustments. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each company's cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write-down in our consolidated statements of income. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. 50% 35% 15% Marketable equity securities $ (0.9 ) $ (0.6 ) $ (0.3 ) Fixed Income Investments At December 2, 2005, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $1,657.3 million compared to $1,272.8 million at December 3, 2004, an increase of 30%. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. The table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. A significant proportion of securities classified as ""due after three years,"" based on the stated maturity, have structural features that allow us to sell the securities, at par, in less than three years. Due within one year $ 818.6 Due within two years 315.3 Due within three years 114.1 Due after three years 409.3 Total $ 1,657.3 61 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 2, 2005. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (3.7 ) $ (7.2 ) $ (10.9 ) 12 month horizon $ (1.3 ) $ (2.5 ) $ (3.8 ) We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. Our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to 2.5 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. It is our policy to review privately-held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies.

The discussions in this section of this Report for fiscal 2007, as well as the financial statements contained herein, reflect the impact of the acquisition. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, high-end consumers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs, direct to end users and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-PC platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. These accounting estimates, critical to understanding our results of operations, are as follows: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence (""VSOE"") of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel 52 inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. Our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Accordingly, our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use 53 historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax returns, primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. 54 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2007 During fiscal 2007, our software and technologies continued to redefine how people engage with ideas and information—anytime, anywhere and through any medium. Our solutions drove strong revenue and earnings growth during the year. In our Creative Solutions segment, we generated strong year-over-year growth based on the release of our new Creative Suite version 3 family of products. Consisting of six new Creative Suite products and thirteen individual applications, our Creative Suite 3 product launch during the year was the largest in our 25-year history. In addition, we achieved solid growth in digital imaging and digital video hobbyist markets with the introduction of new versions of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products. In our Knowledge Worker segment, we achieved solid year-over-year growth based on continued adoption of our Acrobat 8 family of products. We also continued to grow our Acrobat Connect business which provides real-time collaboration capabilities via the Web utilizing our Adobe Flash Player. Our Enterprise and Developer segment also achieved solid results in 2007, generating record revenue and gaining broad market acceptance in the categories of Document Services and RIAs with our LiveCycle and Flex technologies. Our Mobile and Device business achieved strong year-over-year growth due to the ongoing success we have had targeting mobile operators, handset manufacturers and consumer electronic device manufactures with our Flash Lite and Flash Cast technologies. In our Other segments, revenue decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to lower revenue associated with some of our legacy products in our Print and Classic Publishing segment. Our PostScript printing technology, a key part of our Other segment revenue, generated year-over-year growth.

See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk regarding foreign currency risks. Product Backlog With regard to our product backlog, the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to, for example, the fluctuations associated with the finalization and release of new products. Our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal 2007, other than those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy, was approximately 7% of fourth quarter fiscal 2007 revenue. The comparable backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were approximately 6% of third quarter fiscal 2007 revenue and 2% of fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue, respectively. 58 Cost of Revenue Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 Product $ 270.8 20 % $ 226.5 152 % $ 90.0 Percentage of total revenue 9 % 9 % 5 % Services and support 83.9 27 % 66.0 192 % 22.6 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 3 % 1 % Total cost of revenue $ 354.7 $ 292.5 $ 112.6 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.

Investment Gain (Loss), net fluctuated due to the following: 2007 2006 2005 Net gains (losses) related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ 6.9 $ (6.5 ) $ (1.0 ) Gains from sale of equity investments 0.2 67.9 — Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities — — (0.6 ) Gains from sale of short-term investments — — 0.1 Gains (losses) on stock warrants — (0.2 ) 0.2 Total investment gain (loss) $ 7.1 $ 61.2 $ (1.3 ) Investment gains were higher in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2005 due to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Interest and Other Income, net The largest component of interest and other income, net is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging transactions, and interest expense. Interest and other income, net increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of higher rates of return on invested cash and short-term investments. Interest and other income, net increased during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher levels of cash and short-term investments and higher rates of return during fiscal 2006. These gains were partially offset by losses associated with our foreign currency hedging program. 63 Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 Provision $ 223.4 28 % $ 173.9 7 % $ 162.9 Percentage of total revenue 7 % 7 % 8 % Effective tax rate 24 % 26 % 21 % Our effective tax rate decreased approximately 2% during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2006. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2006. A $12.3 million cumulative tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2006 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rate increased 5% during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The net increase is primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on December 31, 2005 and because the 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Net changes in accrued expenses is primarily attributable to increases in accrued bonuses and accrued localization costs related to the localization of CS3 during fiscal 2007. Income taxes payable increased due to overall increased taxable income. Increases to deferred revenue relate primarily to 64 deferred maintenance and service revenue due to strong upgrade plan sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for CS3 and related point products.

We ended fiscal 2007 with days sales outstanding (""DSO"") in trade receivables of 32 days. The primary working capital uses of cash were payments for accrued restructuring costs and outlays for prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period. Our DSO was 31 days ending fiscal 2005. We discontinued our practice of paying quarterly cash dividends after payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash from investing activities decreased from net cash provided for fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million to net cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $83.3 million.

No similar transactions of this magnitude occurred during fiscal 2007. The primary sources of cash during fiscal 2007 were sales and maturities of short-term investments offset in part by purchases of short-term investments. Uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets which relate primarily to the technology licensing arrangements that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and three acquisitions completed in fiscal 2007. Additionally, as part of our lease extension for the Almaden Tower lease completed during the second fiscal quarter of 2007, we purchased a portion of the lease receivable totaling $80.4 million.

These proceeds were offset in part by purchases of short-term investments, net of sales and maturities, acquisitions of property, plant and equipment, cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of long-term investments. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used for financing activities increased $602.8 million for a total of $1.4 billion during fiscal 2007 as compared to cash used for the same period last year. Net cash used for financing activities increased $500.8 million for a total of $747.4 million during fiscal 2006 as compared to cash used of $246.6 million during fiscal 2005. Increases in both periods presented were primarily due to additional purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year. Cash used for stock repurchases increased from the respective periods presented due to a higher average cost per share, a greater number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements. (See the following sections titled ""Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II""). We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. The Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. As previously disclosed, we plan to invest $100.0 million directly in venture capital, of which, approximately $16.2 million has already been spent. The remaining balance will be invested over the next three to five years. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2008 in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part II, Item 1A titled ""Risk Factors"". During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we also increased our existing $500.0 million credit facility to $1.0 billion. This credit facility will be used to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes including stock repurchases. In January 2008, we drew down $450.0 million under this facility. Also, we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise additional capital in the bank or public market, if required. See Notes 16 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our credit facility. We use professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 73% of our invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Within the U.S., the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury notes and highly rated corporate notes. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. As of the end of fiscal 2007, $530.8 million of the securities now classified as short-term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within 90 days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents. All investments are made according to policies approved by the Board of Directors. 66 Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5 in this Report for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 30, 2007. As part of this program, on April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of an additional $1.0 billion for stock repurchases commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. This additional $1.0 billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (""VWAP"") of our common stock. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at periodic intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. For fiscal 2007, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 30, 2007 are excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of November 30, 2007 under this program will expire on or before June 19, 2008. As of November 30, 2007 approximately $422.6 million of up-front payments remained under the agreements. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $40.04 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2006. Subsequent to November 30, 2007, we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $150.0 million. The $150.0 million will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. See Notes 12 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our structured stock repurchase agreements. Stock Repurchase Program II In April 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program. Under the new program, which is not subject to expiration, we are authorized to repurchase in aggregate up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. This program is in addition to our existing stock repurchase program designed to return value to our shareholders and offset dilution from employee stock programs. During fiscal 2007, we had provided prepayments of $850.0 million under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions under this program. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 17.7 million shares through structured share repurchase agreements at an average price of $40.50 and approximately $133.7 million of up-front payments remained under these agreements. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of November 30, 2007 under this program will expire on or before March 18, 2008. 67 As part of this program, in November 2007, the Board of Directors approved a 30 million share increase commencing in fiscal 2008 to this Stock Repurchase Program II. This increases the authorization under this program from the original 20 million shares to 50 million shares. Subsequent to November 30, 2007, we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $1.0 billion. The $1.0 billion will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. See Notes 12 and 21 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our structured stock repurchase agreements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 30, 2007, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commitments. Lease Commitments Two of our lease agreements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of November 30, 2007, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we expect to remain in compliance during the next 12 months. We believe these limitations will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of November 30, 2007: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Total non-cancellable operating leases $ 291.1 $ 55.3 $ 78.5 $ 46.1 $ 111.2 Total purchase commitments 140.0 133.2 6.8 — — Total $ 431.1 $ 188.5 $ 85.3 $ 46.1 $ 111.2 68 Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Interpretation No. 45 (""FIN 45""), ""Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others"", the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the leases. As of November 30, 2007, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $4.2 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. 69 Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments In countries outside the U.S., we transact business, in U.S. dollars and in various other currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in Euro and Yen are subject to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. We have foreign exchange option and forward contracts for Yen- and Euro-denominated revenue. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, our revenue exposures were 35.5 billion Yen, 32.8 billion Yen, and 26.4 billion Yen, respectively. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, our revenue exposures were 595.5 million Euros, 504.7 million Euros, and 411.4 million Euros, respectively. Our Japanese operating expenses are in Yen and our European operating expenses are primarily in Euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to Yen and Euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to neutralize the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of November 30, 2007, total outstanding contracts were $673.0 million which included the notional equivalent of $440.3 million in Euro, $154.3 million in Yen, and $78.4 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of November 30, 2007, all contracts were set to expire at various times through June 2008. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition, we also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 30, 2007 and December 1, 2006, this long-term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $119.7 million and $85.9 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain operational (""cash flow"") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange option contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese Yen and the Euro. We enter into these foreign exchange option contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. 70 See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 30, 2007, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 30, 2007. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $34.5 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $17.7 million. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities. Long-Term Investments Long-term investments include both equity holdings in publicly traded companies as well as investments in several privately-held companies. We have a policy in place to review our long-term investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not a security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each company's cash position, financing needs, earnings and revenue outlook, operational performance, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity, management and ownership changes and competition. The evaluation of privately-held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we believe the carrying value of our investment is in excess of fair value, it is our policy to write down these long-term investments to fair value and record the related write-down in our consolidated statements of income. 71 We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 30, 2007, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $20.8 million compared to $11.9 million at December 1, 2006. The increase was due to the change in the fair market value of our equity holdings during fiscal 2007. See Note 6 for information regarding our limited partnership interest in Adobe Ventures. The privately-held companies in which we invest, can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities as of November 30, 2007, that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another. 50% 35% 15% Marketable equity securities $ (10.4 ) $ (7.3 ) $ (3.1 ) Fixed Income Investments At November 30, 2007, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1,026.6 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. Due within one year $ 808.3 Due within two years 194.8 Due within three years 23.5 Due after three years — Total $ 1,026.6 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 30, 2007. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. The following table represents the potential change in the value of our fixed income securities given an increase in interest rates of various magnitudes. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (0.5 ) $ (1.0 ) $ (1.5 ) 12 month horizon $ 1.2 $ 2.3 $ 3.5 We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. Our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to 2.5 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. 72",2023-12-30 17:04:54.104193

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document. ACQUISITION OF MACROMEDIA On December 3, 2005, we completed the acquisition of Macromedia for approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future, but we also anticipate cost saving synergies. We incurred restructuring charges of $19.7 million during fiscal 2006. Coinciding with the integration of Macromedia and the start of our 2006 fiscal year, we changed the reporting of our segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our various businesses. The discussions in this section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the financial statements contained herein, reflect the impact of the acquisition. See Note 2 for further information regarding this acquisition. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by high-end consumers, creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs; direct to end users; and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to major hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-personal computer platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and 47 estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry. Revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change. In applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions, if any, must be deferred. In order to determine current and deferred revenue, we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. Our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenues could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues. In determining our estimate for returns, and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. More or less product may be returned from what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation We adopted the provisions of, and account for stock-based compensation in accordance with, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 123R during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We elected the modified-prospective method, under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. As permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 107, we estimate the 48 volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All share based payment awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares. Existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock-based compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock-based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of those stock-based payments in the future. Certain stock-based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. There currently is no market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values. The guidance in SFAS 123R and SAB 107 is relatively new. The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the SFAS 123R disclosures. Goodwill Impairment We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances warrant a review. We make judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. The timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of income in our current reporting period that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects the asset relates to, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the 49 value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax returns, primarily related to our intercompany transfer pricing. Although we believe our judgments, assumptions and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2006 During fiscal 2006, we continued to focus on delivering market-leading technologies and software that are redefining business, entertainment, and personal communications. Our solutions, which utilize industry standards for producing and delivering content that allow people to engage with information virtually anywhere at anytime, drove strong revenue and earnings growth in the year. In our Creative Solution segment, we generated strong year-over-year growth based on the addition of Macromedia products to our product portfolio and the performance of our Creative Suite products family. In addition, to capitalize on the broad adoption of digital video on the Web, we introduced Production Studio 1.0 - a suite of video products - including Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0, Adobe After Effects 7.0, Adobe Audition 2.0, and Adobe Encore 2.0. This new release drove strong year-over-year growth in the digital video category of our creative business. 50 In the fourth quarter, we introduced new versions of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements hobbyist products, which target consumers who desire professional-like capabilities with an easy-to-use interface for enhancing and sharing their memories in the form of images and video. These products contributed strong year-over-year growth in this category of our Creative Solutions segment. In our Knowledge Worker segment, we introduced Adobe Acrobat 3D 7.0 in the first quarter to address the needs of the engineering and manufacturing markets, where complex documents are created and shared across diverse user bases and platforms. In addition, we delivered the Acrobat 8 family of products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Acrobat 8 has numerous new features to help drive increased adoption by users in enterprises, governments and specialized vertical markets such as architecture, engineering and construction. In combination with the delivery of Acrobat 8, we introduced Acrobat Connect, a rebranded and new version of the former Macromedia Breeze product, which provides real-time collaboration via the Web. Together, these product introductions and our execution against the opportunities we forecast in the knowledge worker business helped us to achieve strong year-over-year growth in this business. Our Enterprise and Developer segment also achieved solid results in 2006, generating record revenue and gaining broad market acceptance in the categories of Document Services and Rich Internet Applications with our LiveCycle and Flex technologies. In our Other segments, we achieved solid growth through the monetization of our platform technologies, as well as new releases of existing products such as Adobe Captivate 2 and Adobe Contribute 4 (which were former Macromedia products). Our Postscript printing technology, a key part of our Other segments revenue, also generated year-over-year growth.

For comparability, the prior fiscal period’s results have been reclassified to reflect the realignment of the segments. We have the following segments: Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions, Enterprise and Developer Solutions, Mobile and Device Solutions, and Other. Our Creative Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of creative and developer tasks to an extended set of customers. This segment combines most of the products of our prior Creative Professional and Digital Imaging and Video segments, along with the creative professional-focused products and solutions that we obtained through our acquisition of Macromedia. The Knowledge Worker Solutions segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them reliably share information and collaborate effectively. This segment contains revenue generated by the Adobe Acrobat family of products. Our Enterprise segment provides server-based enterprise interaction solutions that automate people-centric processes. The segment contains revenue generated by our LiveCycle, ColdFusion and Flex lines of products. The Mobile and Device 51 Solutions segment provides solutions that create compelling experiences through rich content, user interfaces, and data services on mobile and non-PC devices such as cellular phones, consumer devices and internet connected hand-held devices. Finally, Other contains several of our products and services which address market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing, to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses, to new strategic opportunities such as OEM revenue generated from our free software downloads, which include Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash Player applications. Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training, and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our Enterprise and Developer Solutions products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.

We did not have platform revenue in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2006 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the addition ofnew products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. We had an approximately 45% increase in revenue from our Digital Video software products due to the release of the Adobe Production Studio and the new versions of our video products. Revenue also increased 9% in our creative products due to continued growth in revenue from our Adobe Creative Suite product and the introduction of new software bundles. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of 2% from our Digital Imaging software products due to product lifecycle timing and the success of our suites and bundles. Revenue from our Knowledge Worker Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared fiscal 2005 primarily due to continued adoption of our Acrobat family of products and the launch of 52 Acrobat 8 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, as well as the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Enterprise and Developer Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. Revenue from this segment also grew due to increases in revenue from our LiveCycle products of 23% as a result of increased licensing and server support revenue, as we continue to successfully focus on both the government sector and financial services. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Mobile and Device Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2006 as compared fiscal 2005, wholly due to the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. Revenue from our Other segments increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to increased revenue from PostScript licensing and to the addition of new products related to the acquisition of Macromedia. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment grew during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. The growth in the segment was due to a 32% increase in revenues from the new versions of our Adobe Creative Suite products which were released during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Additionally, there was a 3% increase in revenues from our digital imaging software products as a result of new releases of our Adobe Photoshop Elements product as well as the new software bundle that combines our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Knowledge Worker segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a 36% increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products. The increase in revenues from our Acrobat desktop products is due to continued adoption of Acrobat desktop products by enterprises and technical professionals, as well as the release of Acrobat 7 during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Enterprise Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to our LiveCycle products. There was approximately a 10% increase in revenue during fiscal 2005 due to increased licensing and server support revenue, as we continued our focus on both the government sector and financial services. Additionally, revenue from our Enterprise Solutions segment increased during fiscal 2005 due to an increase in consulting revenues. There were no notable decreases for fiscal 2005. Revenue from our Other segments decreased slightly during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our Classic Publishing software products. Geographic Information Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Americas $ 1,266.7 35 % $ 939.7 22 % $ 770.6 Percentage of total revenues 49 % 48 % 46 % EMEA 770.1 26 % 612.7 13 % 541.5 Percentage of total revenues 30 % 31 % 33 % Asia 538.5 30 % 413.9 17 % 354.5 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 21 % 21 % Total revenues $ 2,575.3 31 % $ 1,966.3 18 % $ 1,666.6 53 Fiscal 2006 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenue by Geography Overall revenues in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2006 increased comparatively to fiscal 2005 primarily due to the acquisition of Macromedia. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions and Other segments. Revenue in Asia increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, Mobile and Device Solutions, and Other segments. Additionally, due to the weakening of the euro and the yen, revenues in EMEA and Asia measured in U.S. dollars were lower by approximately $13.8 million and $21.2 million, respectively in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenue by Geography Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments. Revenue in EMEA and Asia increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due to the strength of our Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments. Additionally, due to the strength of the euro and the yen, revenues in EMEA and Asia measured in U.S. dollars were higher by approximately $15.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Inventory Information At the end of fiscal 2006 our overall channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows up to an estimated 4.5 weeks of anticipated total product supply at our distributors. With regard to our product backlog, our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. For example, prior to the finalization and release of new products, we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases. Our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal 2006, other than those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global distributor inventory policy, was approximately 2% of fourth quarter fiscal 2006 revenue. The comparable backlog at the end of third quarter of fiscal 2006 was an insignificant percentage of third quarter fiscal 2006 revenue. Cost of Revenues Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Product $ 226.5 152 % $ 90.0 4 % $ 86.6 Percentage of total revenues 9 % 5 % 5 % Services and support 66.0 192 % 22.6 27 % 17.8 Percentage of total revenues 3 % 1 % 1 % Total cost of revenues $ 292.5 160 % $ 112.6 8 % $ 104.4 54 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue fluctuated primarily due to the acquisition of Macromedia in the following areas: % Change 2006 to 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Increased (decreased) amortization of purchased technology 151 % (8 )% Increased cost of sales due to shrink-wrap revenue 3 5 Decreased localization costs related to our product launches (3 ) — Increased royalties for licensed technologies 1 2 (Decreased) increased excess and obsolete inventory (2 ) 1 Increased localization costs related to our product launches — 3 Various individually insignificant items 2 1 Total change 152 % 4 % Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee-related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, due to compensation and related benefits and travel expenses as a result of higher headcount related to increases in services and support activities. Included in compensation costs for fiscal 2006 are compensation and related benefits, including amortization of deferred compensation, for former Macromedia employees and stock-based compensation costs as a result of adopting SFAS 123R at the beginning of fiscal 2006. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impact of SFAS 123R. Cost of services and support revenue also increased due to costs associated with our Expert Support program. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to increases in headcount related expenses, including higher compensation and related benefits, as well as outsourced consulting fees. Operating Expenses Research and Development Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Expenses $ 539.9 48 % $ 365.3 17 % $ 311.3 Percentage of total revenues 21 % 19 % 19 % Research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. 55 Research and development expenses fluctuated due to the following: % Change 2006 to 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Increased compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth related to the Macromedia acquisition, higher incentive compensation, amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acquisition of Macromedia and stock-based compensation costs as a result of adopting SFAS 123R at the beginning of fiscal 2006 37 % — Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation — 10 % Increased facility costs related to acquisition of Macromedia 5 — Increased use of contractors 1 1 Increased repairs and maintenance 1 — Increased purchases of equipment and software licenses 1 2 Various individually insignificant items 3 4 Total change 48 % 17 % We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, pursuant to Board of Directors’ approval, we implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate 313 positions, held by Adobe employees worldwide and which impacted all functional areas. The reduction in force was completed in fiscal 2006. The restructuring plan, which is estimated to be completed in fiscal 2007, also includes costs related to the world-wide consolidation of facilities, the cancellation of certain contracts and the write-off of fixed assets located at facilities that will be vacated. During fiscal 2006, the total restructuring charges of $19.7 million included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and costs related to the closure of duplicative facilities and the cancellation of certain contracts. We did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2005 and 2004.

Investment Gain (Loss) Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses of Adobe Ventures, and other direct investments. 2006 2005 2004 Net losses related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $(6.5 ) $(1.0 ) $(0.1 ) Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities — (0.6 ) — Gains from sale of short-term investments — 0.1 2.5 Gains from sale of equity investments 67.9 — — Gains (losses) on stock warrants (0.2 ) 0.2 0.1 Total investment gain (loss) $61.2 $(1.3 ) $2.5 The increase in our investment gain from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies. Interest and Other Income The largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transactions including hedging gains and losses, and interest expense. Interest and other income increased during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher levels of cash and short term investments and higher rates of return during fiscal 2006. These gains were partially offset by increased costs of our foreign currency hedging program. Interest and other income increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and higher interest rates during fiscal 2005, as well as higher gains on our foreign currency hedging program. 59 Income Tax Provision Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Provision $ 173.9 7 % $ 162.9 3 % $ 158.2 Percentage of total revenues 7 % 8 % 10 % Effective tax rate 26 % 21 % 26 % Our effective tax rate increased five percentage points during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The net increase is primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on December 31, 2005 and because the 2005 effective tax rate included a tax benefit recognized in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. In December 2006, after the end of Adobe’s fiscal year, the federal research and development tax credit was retroactively extended from January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2007 which includes an 11 month period in Adobe’s 2006 fiscal year. The impact of this new tax law will be reflected in our fiscal 2007 results including an approximately $12 million discrete item in our first quarter fiscal 2007 results for the credit relating to fiscal 2006. Our effective tax rate decreased four percentage points during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to a tax benefit recognized as a result of the release of certain deferred tax liabilities in connection with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. In addition, our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point due to a variety of factors, including higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate and a reduction of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Fiscal 2006 % Change 2006 to 2005 Fiscal 2005 % Change 2005 to 2004 Fiscal 2004 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 2,280.9 34 % $ 1,700.8 30 % $ 1,313.2 Working capital 2,207.1 44 % 1,528.2 38 % 1,107.1 Stockholders’ equity $ 5,151.9 176 % $ 1,864.3 31 % $ 1,423.5 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll (salaries, bonuses, and benefits), general operating expenses (marketing, travel, office rent) and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2006, of $927.2 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital source of cash was a decrease in other current assets and increases in income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher current tax liabilities related to overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included an increase in trade receivables and decreases in accrued expenses and accrued restructuring. Our trade receivables increased due to an increase in revenue. As compared to the same period last year, our days sales outstanding in trade receivables (“DSO”) increased from 31 days to 48 days. The increase in DSO was due to an increase in revenue in the latter part of the year due to timing of product shipments and an increase in certain receivables from the Macromedia acquisition which have longer payment terms. Accrued expenses decreased because of compensation related costs and other expenses. Accrued restructuring decreased because of payments made during fiscal 2006; please refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 60 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005, of $758.4 million, primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, income taxes payable and deferred revenue. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs and marketing expenses. Income taxes payable increased as a result of higher current tax liabilities related to repatriation of certain foreign earnings and overall increased taxable income. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period. As compared to fiscal 2004, our DSO was 31 days, one day higher than fiscal 2004. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004, of $704.8, million primarily comprised net income, net of non-cash related expenses. Working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections. Working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million increased from net cash used in fiscal 2005 of $348.4 million due to the net cash acquired with Macromedia and due to the sale of our minority equity investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. These proceeds were partially offset by purchases of long term investments and acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment as well as net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2006. Net cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2005 of $348.4 million decreased from net cash used in fiscal 2004 of $351.3 million because there was not an investment in a lease receivable (related to our corporate headquarter office buildings) as there was in 2004. This was partially offset by higher net purchases of short-term investments and payments for acquisition costs in fiscal 2005. Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2006 of $774.7 million increased from net cash used in fiscal 2005 of $246.6 million primarily due to the purchases of treasury stock. Cash used during fiscal 2006 was partially offset by the proceeds related to the issuance of the treasury stock from exercises of employee stock options. Cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2006 increased from the prior year due to a higher average cost per share, a higher number of shares being repurchased, and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements (see section titled “Stock Repurchase Program—On-Going Dilution). Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2005 of $246.6 million increased from cash used in fiscal 2004 of $224.5 million primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the re-issuance of treasury stock as a result of a lower number of options being exercised. We discontinued our quarterly cash dividend after the payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs. Under the terms of our lease agreements for our San Jose headquarters, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs. In fiscal 2006, we entered into various agreements with San Jose Water Corporation and certain of its affiliates to acquire land and a building in downtown San Jose for $36.5 million. The building and certain parking areas were used by the San Jose Water Company and will be leased back to San Jose Water Corporation until mid 2008. Additionally, the Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion plan for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. We are also in the process of extending our lease for the Almaden Tower for a five year term with an additional five years at our option. We have received Board approval to purchase a portion of the lease receivable of the lessor as 61 we have done with the East and West Towers. We expect a cash outlay of approximately $90 million when the transaction closes sometime during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We expect to continue our investing activities, including investments in short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. In addition, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in venture capital over the next three to five years in Companies leveraging our platform technologies. Adobe uses professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 77% of Adobe’s invested balances during fiscal 2006. Within the U.S., the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury notes and highly rated corporate notes. The balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market and enhanced money market funds for working capital purposes. As of December 1, 2006, $182.3 million of the securities now classified as short-term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within 90 days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents. All investments are made according to policies approved by the Board of Directors. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2007 in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, we have received Board approval to execute a $500 million credit facility which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This credit facility will provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes for a period of up to 5 years. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Stock Repurchase Program—On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. Refer to Part II, Item 5(c) in this Annual Report for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 1, 2006. As part of this program, on April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of an additional $1.0 billion for stock repurchase commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. This additional $1.0 billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $1.3 billion and $600 million, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price of our common stock. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. 62 The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. For fiscal 2006, the $1.3 billion prepayment was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2006 are excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of December 1, 2006 will expire on or before July 19, 2007. As of December 1, 2006 approximately $204.0 million of up-front payments remained under the agreements. At the beginning of fiscal 2007, we entered into an additional structured repurchase agreement with a large financial institution, whereupon we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of $300.0 million which will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet. Summary of Stock Repurchases for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands, except average amounts) Board Approval Repurchases 2006 2005 2004 Date Under the Plan Shares Average Shares Average Shares Average December 1997 From employees(1) 134 $ 37.10 7 $ 29.16 10 $ 25.65 Open market 1,650 36.04 — — 12,414 20.82 Structured repurchases(2) 36,792 34.00 18,708 30.61 9,532 23.33 Total shares 38,576 34.10 18,715 $ 30.61 21,956 $ 21.91 Total cost $ 1,315,317 $ 572,930 $ 481,075 (1) The repurchases from employees represent shares canceled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due. (2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See “Stock Repurchase Program I—On-going Dilution Coverage” above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of December 1, 2006, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments The two lease agreements discussed in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are subject to standard financial covenants. As of December 1, 2006 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants. We expect to remain within compliance in the next 12 months. We are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our lease commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of December 1, 2006: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Total non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income* $ 201.4 $ 47.2 $ 73.9 $ 26.4 $ 53.9 * These amounts are net of sublease income. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Statements for further detail regarding our future commitments under these non-cancelable operating leases. 63 Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. Under FIN 45, the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As such, we recognized a $5.2 million liability related to the East and West towers lease that was extended in August 2004. This liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the lease. As of December 1, 2006, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantee remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $2.8 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes. Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in foreign countries, in U.S. dollars and in various foreign currencies. In Europe and Japan, transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to yen-denominated product and support revenue in Japan and euro-denominated product and support revenue in certain European countries. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, our revenue exposures were 32.8 billion yen, 26.4 billion yen, and 24.1 billion yen, respectively. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, our revenue exposures were 504.7 million euros, 411.4 million euros, and 375.4 million euros, respectively. 64 Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen and our European operating expenses are primarily in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is intended to neutralize the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. At December 1, 2006, total outstanding contracts were $646.8 million which included the notional equivalent of $434.7 million in euro, $176.1 million in yen, and $36.0 million in other foreign currencies. These hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures. In addition, we had the notional equivalent of $419.0 million in purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue. As of December 1, 2006, all contracts were set to expire at various times through July 2007. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. In addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-USD functional currency foreign subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ending December 1, 2006 and December 2, 2005 this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of $85.9 million and $56.7 million, respectively. At this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures. Economic Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange option contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange option contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 1, 2006, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. See also Note 16 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Balance Sheet Hedging—Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 1, 2006, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 150 days or less. 65 A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 1, 2006. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes equation model was used. For forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $39.9 million and $66.6 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $18.8 million and $27.4 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. See also Note 16 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of December 1, 2006, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $11.9 million compared to $1.8 million at December 2, 2005. The increase was due to distributions from Adobe Ventures of the fair value of two previously private companies that went public during fiscal 2006. The investments were reclassified from long-term to short-term. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term. We have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each company’s cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write-down in our consolidated statements of income. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35% and 15% were selected for illustrative purposes because none is more likely to occur than another. 50% 35% 15% Marketable equity securities $ (5.9 ) $ (4.2 ) $ (1.8 ) Fixed Income Investments At December 1, 2006, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $2,220.0 million compared to $1,657.3 million at December 2, 2005, an increase of 34%. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. The table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates. A significant 66 proportion of securities classified as “due after three years,” based on the stated maturity, have structural features that allow us to sell the securities, at par, in less than three years. Due within one year $ 1,505.0 Due within two years 409.7 Due within three years 175.3 Due after three years 130.0 Total $ 2,220.0 A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 1, 2006. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. The following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis. 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 6 month horizon $ (5.5 ) $ (11.1 ) $ (16.6 ) 12 month horizon $ (2.9 ) $ (5.9 ) $ (8.8 ) We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. Our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to 2.5 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. It is our policy to review privately-held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies’ cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies.

We license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers, and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, value-added resellers (""VARs""), systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs""); direct to end users; and through our own website at www.adobe.com. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA""); and Asia. Our software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, Linux, UNIX, Palm OS, Pocket PC, and Symbian platforms. Revenue 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 ---------------- ------- ---------- ------- ----------- Revenue Products $1,153.2 (6 )% $1,229.7 (3 )% $1,266.4 Services and support 11.6 100 --- --- --- ---------------- ------- ---------- ------- ----------- $1,164.8 (5 )% $1,229.7 (3 )% $1,266.4 ---------------- ------- ---------- ------- ----------- We have four reportable segments that offer different product lines: Graphics, Cross-media Publishing, ePaper Solutions, and OEM PostScript and Other. The Graphics segment provides users with software for creating, editing and enhancing digital images and photographs, digital video, animations, graphics, and illustrations. The Cross-media Publishing segment provides software for professional page layout, professional Web page layout, technical document publishing, and business publishing. The ePaper Solutions segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create, enhance, annotate, and securely send Adobe PDF files that can be shared, viewed, navigated, and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms. In addition, our recently-acquired Accelio business focusing on electronic forms is included in our ePaper segment. The OEM PostScript and Other segment includes printing technology to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision. Revenue from our Graphics segment is derived primarily from the licensing of the following application products: Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe Premiere, Photoshop Elements, After Effects, Adobe Graphics Server (formerly called Adobe AlterCast), Digital Video Collection, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, Atmosphere, and LiveMotion. Cross-media Publishing includes the following application products: Web Collection, GoLive, Design Collection, Adobe Publishing Collection, PageMaker, FrameMaker, Adobe Type products, InDesign, Adobe Creative Suites, Adobe Content Server, eBooks, and PressReady. The ePaper Solutions segment includes Adobe Acrobat software and other Acrobat related technologies, Document Server, Form Server, Output Server, and Workflow Server. The OEM Postscript and Other segment includes printing technology to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, we realigned our business segments to reflect the recent change in the way we manage our business. The former Graphics segment has been renamed the Digital Imaging and Video segment. The former Cross-media Publishing segment has been renamed the Creative Professional segment and includes two products that were formerly included in our Graphics segment, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Graphics Server (formerly called Adobe AlterCast). There were no changes to our ePaper and OEM Postscript and Other segments. The management discussion and analysis that follows is based on our segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal 2002. For more information on both our old and new segment reporting, please refer to Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Products Fiscal 2002 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2001 Revenue During fiscal 2002, our products revenue decreased 6%, or $76.6 million, compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to continued economic weakness in Asia, Europe, and the U.S., as well as declines in revenue from our Graphics, Cross-media Publishing, and OEM PostScript and Other segments, for reasons explained below. Revenue from our Graphics segment decreased 7%, or $40.4 million, from $543.4 million in fiscal 2001 to $503.0 million in fiscal 2002. The annual decrease in revenue in our Graphics segment was primarily due to a 13% year-over-year decline in our illustration software revenue, due to product lifecycle timing and the continued economic impact on creative professional customers, who are the main end-user market for this software. We also experienced a 3% overall decline in our digital imaging software revenue, which includes the Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Adobe PhotoDeluxe products. We believe the decline in digital imaging software is due to a combination of the economic weakness across the world, the impact of lower marketing spending by corporations resulting in a reduced number of creative professional customers, and the trend of our customers migrating towards the purchasing of Adobe Collection products as opposed to individual products. In addition, we experienced a 15% year-over-year revenue decline in our digital video software licensing, which is made up of our Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects, and our Adobe Digital Video Collection products, due to product lifecycle timing and the economic impact on the digital video software market. Revenue from our Cross-media Publishing segment decreased 10%, or $29.4 million, from $289.6 million in fiscal 2001 to $260.2 million in fiscal 2002. The annual decrease in revenue from our Cross-media Publishing segment during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to multiple factors. In the Web publishing segment, we experienced a 35% decline in revenue from our Web-focused products: Adobe GoLive and the Adobe Web Collection. We attribute this decline to weakness in the Web publishing segment and less sales and marketing emphasis. In addition, we experienced a 23% year-over-year decline in our business publishing revenue, which is derived from our PageMaker and Adobe Publishing Collection products. We attribute this decline to the weaker global economy in 2002 when compared to 2001, the adoption of our Adobe Design Collection product (especially by creative professionals) instead of the Adobe Publishing Collection product, and less sales and marketing emphasis. Finally, we experienced a 29% year-over-year decline in type and technical publishing products, which includes our Adobe FrameMaker product, due to overall economic weakness in the geographic markets in which these products are used. The decrease in revenue from these Cross-media products in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was partially offset by a 42% increase in revenue in our professional layout publishing products, which includes revenue from our InDesign, Adobe Design Collection, and Adobe Creative Suites products. We attribute this revenue increase to increased marketing activities and growing customer demand. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased 15%, or $15.8 million, from $104.8 million in fiscal 2001 to $89.0 million in fiscal 2002, due to the following factors: continued weakness in the print business, lower average selling prices generating less royalties from certain OEM customers, and smaller OEM customers transferring to clone PostScript technologies. Revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue, but if it significantly exceeds our expectations, it may harm our future results. The decrease in revenue from the above-mentioned segments in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was partially offset by an increase of $9.0 million, or 3%, in our ePaper Solutions segment. This segment increased from $291.9 million in fiscal 2001 to $300.9 million in fiscal 2002, primarily due to a 5% increase in Acrobat revenue in the U.S. and an increase in revenue of $21.5 million from our newly-acquired Accelio business. Fiscal 2001 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2000 Revenue During fiscal 2001, our overall product revenue decreased 3%, or $36.7 million, compared to fiscal 2000, primarily due to adverse economic conditions, especially in the U.S., and a decline in revenue from our Graphics, Cross-media Publishing, and OEM PostScript and Other segments for the reasons explained below. Revenue from our Graphics segment decreased 10%, or $58.7 million, from $602.1 million in fiscal 2000 to $543.4 million in fiscal 2001. We attribute this decrease in Graphics segment revenue primarily to severe economic pressure on the creative professional and consumer markets, as well as product lifecycle timing and the decline in spending on Web-focused software tools. As a result of these factors, we experienced an 11% decrease in our digital imaging software revenue and a 17% decrease in our illustration software revenue when comparing fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2000. The declines in our fiscal 2001 Graphics business were partially offset by a 14% year-over-year revenue increase in our digital video software products. Growth in our digital video software revenue was driven by new updates of our products in fiscal 2001. Revenue from our Cross-media Publishing segment decreased 11%, or $35.6 million, from $325.2 million in fiscal 2000 to $289.6 million in fiscal 2001. The largest factors contributing to the Cross-media Publishing segment revenue decline were a 25% year-over-year decline in our Web publishing software revenue due to weakness in the Web layout and Web animation products market, a 23% year-over-year decline in type and technical publishing products due to product lifecycle timing and overall economic weakness in the geographic markets in which these products are used, and a 19% decline in our business publishing software revenue due to the adoption of our Adobe Design Collection product (especially by creative professionals) instead of our Adobe Publishing Collection product. The declines in our fiscal 2001 Cross-media Publishing segment were partially offset by a 55% year-over-year revenue increase from our professional page layout publishing products due to increased marketing and promotional activities for these products throughout the year. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment decreased 20%, or $26.7 million, from $131.5 million in fiscal 2000 to $104.8 million in fiscal 2001, due to the following factors: continued weakness in the print business, renegotiated pricing with certain OEM customers, and the outsourcing of certain OEM accounts to a third party solution provider. The decrease in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was partially offset by an increase of 41%, or $84.3 million, in our ePaper Solutions segment, as it increased from $207.6 million in fiscal 2000 to $291.9 million in fiscal 2001, due to the release of our Acrobat 5.0 product in the second quarter of fiscal 2001, as well as the continuing movement from paper-based processes to electronic workflows by enterprises and government agencies which contributed to broader adoption of our ePaper products. Services and Support Services and support is composed of professional services (such as consulting services and training) and support (such as maintenance and technical support) primarily related to the products we acquired from Accelio. Professional services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and is measured monthly based primarily on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Our professional services revenue depends in large part on our software license revenue from the products that we acquired from Accelio. A significant portion of our support revenue is composed of our extended Enterprise Maintenance and Support offerings, which entitles customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support period, which is typically one year. Our support revenue depends on both our software license revenue and renewals of our maintenance agreements. Our support revenue also includes support for our desktop products whereby Adobe offers a range of support programs, from fee-based incident to annual support contracts, and Developer Support to partners and developer organizations. For fiscal 2002, our services and support revenue increased $11.6 million, or 100%, compared to fiscal 2001 solely due to the acquisition of the Accelio business in April 2002. Geographic and Platform Information We categorize our geographic results into three major market regions: the Americas, EMEA, and Asia. Revenue generated in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia as a percentage of total revenue is presented below: 2002 2001 2000 ----- ----- ----- Americas 50 % 48 % 52 % EMEA 27 27 26 Asia 23 25 22 ----- ----- ----- 100 % 100 % 100 % The decrease in the percent of revenue from Asia and corresponding increase in the Americas in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to weakness in the Japan economy. The decrease in the Americas in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to adverse economic conditions, especially in the U.S. Overall, revenue from our application products on the Windows and Macintosh platforms decreased 4% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, revenue from our application products on the Windows platform increased 9%, and revenue from our application products on the Macintosh platform decreased 21% during the same period. In fiscal 2002, the Windows and Macintosh platforms accounted for 71% and 29%, respectively, of application products revenue, excluding platform-independent and UNIX products, compared to 70% and 30%, respectively, in fiscal 2001, and 63% and 37%, respectively, in fiscal 2000. We expect the trend towards the Windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future. Cost of revenue 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 ------------ ------- ---------- ------- -------------- Cost of revenue Products $96.9 19 % $81.5 (7 )% $87.3 Services and support 7.4 100 --- --- --- ------------ ------- ---------- ------- -------------- Total cost of revenue $104.3 28 % $81.5 (7 )% $87.3 Percentage of total revenue 9.0 % 6.6 % 6.9 % Products Cost of products revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies, hosted server costs, and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of products revenue increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to increased amortization of website development costs related to Adobe Design Team (formerly Adobe Studio) which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, and the subsequent impairment charge for the remaining Adobe Design Team development costs due to the decision to discontinue the Adobe Design Team service in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Cost of products revenue decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, primarily due to an 8% decrease in third-party royalties, mainly associated with our PostScript and Type products revenue, and a 5% decrease in material costs due to decreased product licensing of shrink-wrapped products. These decreases were offset by a 2% increase in localization costs primarily due to localization for our Photoshop and Acrobat products, a 2% increase in excess and obsolete inventory expenses, and a 1% increase in hosted server costs due to the launch of Adobe Design Team (formerly Adobe Studio). Services and Support Cost of services and support is composed primarily of employee-related costs and the related infrastructure costs incurred to provide consulting services, training, and product support for our Accelio business. Cost of services and support increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due to the acquisition of the Accelio business in April 2002. Operating Expenses Research and Development 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Research and development $246.1 10 % $224.1 (7 )% $240.2 Percentage of total revenue 21.1 % 18.2 % 19.0 % Research and development expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses increased $22.0 million, or 10%, in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits related to headcount growth from the acquisition of Accelio to support product development efforts. Research and development expenses decreased $16.1 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Of the 7% change, 3% was due to a decrease in compensation and related benefits due to lower incentive compensation expenses and 2% was due to a decrease in contractor and professional fees as less development work was performed through outside sources. We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Sales and marketing $380.4 (6 )% $403.7 1 % $401.2 Percentage of total revenue 32.7 % 32.8 % 31.7 % Sales and marketing expenses include salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, customer support, order management, and order fulfillment personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations, and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $23.3 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to decreased marketing and advertising spending. Sales and marketing expenses increased $2.5 million, or 1%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. The 1% increase was primarily made up of a 6% increase from marketing spending, which was partially offset by a 3% decrease from compensation and related benefits due to lower incentive compensation. General and Administrative 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 General and administrative $108.1 (7 )% $115.6 (1 )% $116.5 Percentage of total revenue 9.3 % 9.4 % 9.2 % General and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit expenses, travel expenses, and related facilities costs for our finance, human resources, legal, information services, and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business. General and administrative expenses decreased $7.5 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. The 7% decrease was primarily made up of 3% from a decrease in contractor and professional fees, 3% from a decrease in facility expenses due to lower rent expenses, and 3% from a decrease in compensation and related benefits due to reduced headcount. These decreases were partially offset by a 2% increase from higher depreciation expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 1%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. The 1% decrease was primarily made up of 5% from a decrease in bad debt expense related to enhanced global credit evaluations, on-going risk mitigation efforts (such as letters of credit, guarantees, and credit insurance) in Asia, and improved collections of our royalty accounts. This decrease was partially offset by a 2% increase from higher legal fees due to litigation and a 2% increase from facility expenses due to higher utility costs. Restructuring and Other Charges 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Restructuring and other charges $12.1 1 % $12.1 114 % $5.6 Percentage of total revenue 1.0 % 1.0 % 0.4 % In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we incurred a restructuring charge of $11.1 million, which included severance and related charges and the closure of a facility. The related restructuring program eliminated 239 engineering, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions worldwide in order to realign our resources for our future business plans. These plans include adding resources to support our ePaper enterprise business in fiscal 2003. The restructuring program is expected to be completed in fiscal 2003. Of the $11.1 million in charges, $4.7 million remained accrued at November 29, 2002. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we implemented a restructuring program to eliminate 39 redundant sales and marketing positions, held by Adobe employees worldwide, as a result of the acquisition of Accelio. The restructuring included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and the cost of vacating a leased facility. Total restructuring charges were $1.6 million and the majority of these payments were paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Of the $1.6 million in charges, $.05 million remains accrued at November 29, 2002. The remaining payments will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we paid our remaining obligations under our 2001 restructuring program. We also lowered our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring program, resulting in an adjustment of approximately $0.6 million. The adjustment primarily reflected lower than estimated relocation and severance expenses and related charges. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our workforce to our future strategic goals and to align our resources with our lower fiscal 2002 revenue targets due to adverse economic conditions resulting in part from the events of September 11, 2001. This restructuring enabled us to increase our investment in digital imaging, digital video, and ePaper-based businesses in fiscal 2002. As part of the restructuring program, we implemented a reduction in force of 247 positions, affecting organizations throughout the company. The reductions came predominantly from sales and marketing and in our North American operations, and as of November 30, 2001, the majority of these terminations were completed. The restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 was $12.1 million, all of which related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force. As of November 29, 2002, there was no restructuring liability remaining for our fiscal year 2001 restructuring program. For more information, see Note 8 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal 2000, restructuring and other charges consisted of $6.3 million of other charges relating to the disposal of certain equipment and one-time litigation related expenses, and a credit of $0.7 million related to the fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 restructuring programs. The $0.7 million credit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, as we revised our estimates of the total costs associated with the fiscal 1999 and 1998 restructuring programs. The credit primarily reflected lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within Adobe. The remaining credit was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities. Acquired In-Process Research and Development 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Acquired in-process research and development $5.8 100 % $--- (100 )% $0.5 Percentage of total revenue 0.5 % --- --- On April 12, 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Accelio Corporation. Accelio was a provider of Web-enabled solutions that help customers manage business processes driven by electronic forms. We obtained an independent appraiser's valuation to determine the amounts allocated to purchased technology and in-process research and development. The valuation analysis utilized the Income Approach that takes into consideration discounted future cash flows. Based on this valuation $0.4 million was allocated to in-process research and development. The amount allocated to in-process research and development of $0.4 million was expensed as of the date of the acquisition due to the state of the development of certain products and the uncertainty of the technology. In December 2001, we acquired Fotiva, Inc. (""Fotiva""). Substantially all of Fotiva's assets were intellectual property. Fotiva was a development stage software company that created solutions to help consumers manage, store, enrich, and share digital photographs and other related personal media. In connection with the acquisition, substantially all of the purchase price of $5.4 million cash was allocated to in-process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition due to the in-process state of the technology. At the date we acquired Fotiva, it was estimated that 50% of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining 50% of the development effort would take approximately eleven months to complete. The efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily include finalization of coding, internationalization, and extensive quality assurance testing. We developed a new product, Adobe Photoshop Album, that we released in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 using Fotiva's image management technology with our digital imaging and ePaper technologies. In fiscal 2000, we recorded $0.5 million of acquired in-process research and development related to our acquisition of Glassbook, Inc. (""Glassbook""). The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 (""APB 16""). Based on an independent appraiser's valuation, $0.5 million of the total $28.0 million purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development due to the state of the development and the uncertainty of the technology. The ongoing projects at Glassbook at the time of the purchase included the development of the Glassbook Reader and the Glassbook Content Server products. We released new products that contained the purchased technology in April 2001, with Acrobat eBook Reader 2.1 and Adobe Content Server 2.0. Amortization and Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangibles 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles $21.0 47 % $14.3 104 % $7.0 Percentage of total revenue 1.8 % 1.2 % 0.6 % Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles increased $6.7 million, or 47%, in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge for the remaining book value of the Glassbook acquisition. The impairment charge was determined based on discounted future cash flows. As part of the acquisition of Accelio in April 2002, we allocated $75.0 million to goodwill which, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (""SFAS 142""), ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" will not be amortized. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we revised our estimate of certain costs associated with our acquisition of Accelio, resulting in an increase to goodwill of approximately $2.6 million. The adjustment primarily reflected higher than estimated transaction costs and costs related to closing redundant facilities. The goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Accelio and GoLive will be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles increased $7.3 million, or 104%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, due to a full year of amortization of Glassbook goodwill totaling $7.2 million and purchased intangibles of $0.1 million. Nonoperating Income (Loss) Investment Gain (Loss) 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Investment gain (loss) $(17.2 ) 82 % $(93.4 ) (751 )% $14.3 Percentage of total revenue (1.5 )% (7.6 )% 1.1 % Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities, and equity method gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. During fiscal 2002, investment losses consisted of other-than-temporary writedowns related to our marketable equity securities in DigitalThink, Inc., Tumbleweed Communications Corp., Engage, Inc., Virage, Inc., Viewpoint Corporation, AvantGo, Inc., and Salon Media Group, Inc. (formerly Salon.com) of $11.3 million. These losses were partially offset by gains totaling $7.2 million from the sale of our marketable equity securities. We also recorded net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $13.1 million. As of November 29, 2002, our short-term investments included marketable equity securities of $14.1 million and our long-term investments included investments in Adobe Ventures and other cost method investments of $35.6 million. These securities are inherently risky and we may experience further deterioration in fair value in the future. During fiscal 2001, investment losses consisted of other-than-temporary writedowns related to our marketable equity securities in Tumbleweed Communications Corp., Salon Media Group, Inc. (formerly Salon.com), Engage, Inc., Liquent, Inc. (formerly ESPS, Inc.), AvantGo, Inc., Viewpoint Corporation, and Virage, Inc. of $53.1 million. These losses were partially offset by gains totaling $19.5 million from the sale of our marketable equity securities. We also recorded net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments totaling $59.8 million. As of November 30, 2001, our short-term investments included marketable equity securities of $37.8 million and our long-term investments included investments in Adobe Ventures and other cost method investments of $31.7 million. During fiscal 2000, we recorded investment gains related to the sale of a portion of our investment in Tumbleweed Communications Corp. and Digimarc Corporation for $10.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded investment gains totaling $13.0 million related to the mark-to-market valuation adjustment for AvantGo, Inc. and other net gains totaling approximately $15.0 million related to various other Adobe Ventures investments activities. These gains were partially offset by investment losses related to the writedown of our investments in Engage, Inc.; Classmates Online, Inc. (formerly eCircles, Inc.); Salon Media Group, Inc. (formerly Salon.com); and Impresse Corporation, totaling approximately $26.3 million. We are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies and market valuations. Interest and Other Income 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Interest and other income $14.8 (32 )% $21.9 3 % $21.3 Percentage of total revenue 1.3 % 1.8 % 1.7 % Interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and realized gains or losses on the disposal of assets. Interest and other income decreased $7.1 million, or 32%, in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $6.0 million due to lower interest rates and lower realized gains of $2.5 million resulting from the sales of fixed income investments. The decreases in interest and other income in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 were partially offset by a reduction in losses of $1.1 million related to the lowered cost of purchased options used in foreign currency hedging. Interest and other income increased $0.6 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to realized gains of $5.9 million resulting from the sale of fixed income investments. Interest and other income also increased in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 due to higher average cash balances resulting in an increase in interest income of $1.8 million. The increase in interest and other income in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was partially offset by foreign currency losses of $4.4 million. These foreign currency losses resulted from the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (""SFAS No. 133""), ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"" and subsequent recording of the cost of hedging foreign currency exposures in interest and other income. In addition, in fiscal 2000, interest and other income increased due to a one-time gain of $2.5 million from the sale of a corporate facility in Edinburgh, Scotland. Income Tax Provision 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Income tax provision $93.3 (8 )% $101.3 (35 )% $155.9 Percentage of total revenue 8.0 % 8.2 % 12.3 % Effective tax rate 32.8 % 33.0 % 35.1 % Our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2002 from fiscal 2001 and from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2001, due to tax benefits associated with the restructuring of our international operations. Part of the tax rate decrease in fiscal year 2002 was offset by a tax rate increase, approximately 0.8%, due to the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment expense. Factors That May Affect Our Future Performance We believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors, including: adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business introduction of new products by existing and new competitors, particularly Microsoft delays in shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products difficulties in transitions to new markets, including the enterprise, government, corporate business and consumer markets inability to attract and retain key personnel lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades weakness in demand for application software, computers, and printers downward sales price adjustments intellectual property disputes and litigation industry transitions to new business models renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property licensing arrangements changes in accounting rules market risks associated with our equity investments (as discussed later under ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk"") We periodically provide operating model targets for revenue, expenses, gross margin, operating profit, other income, tax rate, and share count. We use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments, not as predictions of future results. The targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions about: product pricing and demand manufacturing costs and volumes the mix of application products and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, distribution channels, and geographic distribution no change occurring in the global market conditions affecting our customers These and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results, including results for the current quarter, to vary materially from these targets or from results for prior periods. In particular, the slow-down in some geographic areas, primarily in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, has adversely affected all of our product segments and may adversely affect our ability to achieve our targets. We attribute this slow-down, which is affecting all of our product segments, to continued economic weakness. These adverse economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and potentially other geographic markets may continue in the short term, and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings. Although there are also adverse conditions in other countries, these other countries represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results. Furthermore, if the economic slow-down worsens or spreads to other geographic areas where we do business, it would likely cause our future results, including results for the current quarter, to vary materially from our targets. In addition, political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business may adversely affect our business. The end markets for our software products are intensely and increasingly competitive and are significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors. In the ePaper applications market, a number of competitors have developed and brought to market clones of our Acrobat application to create and enhance PDF files. Through lower pricing and aggressive marketing to existing or potential Adobe customers, these competitors could impact Adobe Acrobat average seat pricing, and our overall ePaper revenue. Additionally, any incorporation into an operating system of software for the creation of PDF files, or other software that competes with our ePaper or graphics applications, could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, Microsoft has increased its presence in the low-end and mid-range consumer digital imaging/graphics markets, as well as indicating that it may include new electronic form, electronic document distribution, eBook and related functionality like that in Adobe Acrobat and our server-based ePaper software, including announcing a new electronic forms tool that is planned to ship in mid-2003. We believe that, due to Microsoft's market dominance, any new Microsoft products in these markets will be highly competitive with our products. If competing graphics or ePaper products achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results would suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in our markets. Any further consolidations among competitors of ours may result in stronger competitors and may therefore harm our results of operations. Also, as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the enterprise, government, corporate business and consumer markets, we may not successfully adapt our application software licensing and distribution channels, which could cause our operating results to suffer. As we currently have limited experience in these markets, we believe we will need to recruit, train, and retain personnel with experience in these markets, and our failure to do so may harm our ability to penetrate these markets. We could also experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business. In connection with the Accelio acquisition, we may not be successful in integrating Accelio or developing, marketing or licensing products, particularly products for the enterprise, government, corporate business and consumer markets, based on Accelio's technology or expertise. We also may not be successful in integrating its distribution channels with ours, or in developing the necessary relationships with enough significant systems integrators to succeed with these new customer bases. Additionally, we may face unanticipated expenses relating to the integration of Accelio personnel and its products, distribution channels, and administrative functions. All of these factors may affect our realizability of Accelio's assets, including goodwill. We plan to recruit key talent for our future growth, especially to support our enterprise business. These plans to continue to invest in certain areas will require us to continue to hire additional employees. Competition for high-quality personnel, especially highly skilled engineers, is extremely intense. Our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems, and to attract, retain, motivate, and manage employees effectively; otherwise our business could be seriously harmed. We rely on our ability to grant stock options in order to recruit and retain highly skilled employees in a competitive environment. The proposed requirement that stockholder approval would be required for the adoption of all stock option plans and for any material modifications to such plans, as well as the potential requirement to recognize an expense for stock options in our financial statements, may result in our inability to provide adequate incentives to effectively recruit and retain talented employees. Any delays or failures in developing and marketing our products, including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may also have a harmful impact on our results of operations. Our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products. A portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue, earnings, or stock price. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations. We offer our application-based products primarily on Macintosh and Windows platforms, and on some UNIX platforms. We generally offer our server-based products, but not desktop products, on the Linux platform as well as the three platforms mentioned above. To the extent that there is a slow-down of customer purchases of personal computers on either the Windows or Macintosh platform or in general, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on the Linux desktop platform before we choose and are able to offer our products on this platform, our business could be harmed. We distribute our application products primarily through distributors, resellers, retailers, and increasingly, systems integrators and VARs (collectively referred to as ""distributors""). A significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors. In addition, our channel program now focuses our efforts on larger distributors, which has resulted in our dependence on a relatively small number of distributors selling through a large amount of our products. Sales through the distribution channel result in unstable pricing and significant product returns. Our distributors sell our competitors' products; if our distributors favor our competitors' products for any reason, they may fail to market our products as effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, and in that case, our results would suffer. Additionally, one of our goals is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our website at www.adobe.com. Any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online, Internet-based resellers. In addition, we continue to expand into third-party distribution channels, including VARs and systems integrators, in our effort to further broaden our customer base. As a result, the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success. Some of these companies may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions. Our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate. In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party rights, we have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to complex, protracted litigation or negotiations as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, including rights derived from third party licensors. Intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Adverse decisions in such litigation or disputes could have negative results, including subjecting us to significant liabilities, requiring us to seek licenses from others, preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, any one of which could seriously harm our business. Our computer network and applications could be adversely impacted by malicious code such as worms and viruses, which are released into the public Internet using recently discovered vulnerabilities in popular software programs. Although we have a response team that is notified of high-risk malicious events from multiple sources and we take certain preventative measures, these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our business. In some markets and for some products, we have adopted a strategy aiming to increase our market share where it is low and therefore may receive significantly less revenue from certain licensing arrangements than we otherwise would receive for licensing these products. Increased market penetration may in fact lead to lower revenue growth in these areas. While we believe that this potential market share increase will ultimately benefit us, this strategy could instead harm our business through reduced revenue growth. We currently rely on five turnkey assemblers of our products, with at least two turnkeys located in each major region we serve. If any significant turnkey assembler terminates its relationship with us, or if our supply from any significant turnkey is interrupted or terminated for any other reason, we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that turnkey assembler to avoid serious harm to our business. Revenue from our OEM PostScript and Other segment experienced a 15% decline in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, primarily as a result of a decline in the print business. We expect this segment to continue to decline in fiscal 2003 relative to fiscal 2002, which may harm our business if the magnitude of the decline significantly exceeds our expectations. The continuing weakness in the economy is contributing to the decrease in revenue for the monochrome laser printers market, in addition to the decline in average selling prices of monochrome laser printers and the increasing use of inkjet printers. If a current major customer decided to incorporate a clone version instead of Adobe PostScript technology, it could seriously harm our business. Further, OEM partners on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements. We evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for us. The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the Internet. As is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The industry for software that addresses authoring and communications over the Internet is still developing. Standards defining Web graphics have not yet been fully adopted. In addition, new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices. The new models may be less lucrative for us than our existing business models. Moreover, critical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use and access, cost, and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect the growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets. We derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our customers located in Europe and Japan. We generally experience lower revenue from our European operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months. We are uncertain whether the recent currency appreciation experienced in Europe and Japan will continue in the foreseeable future. Our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have significant financial impact. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. We have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily of the Japanese yen and the euro. We regularly review our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our best judgment. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles are subject to interpretation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the ""AICPA""), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. Our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows: software revenue recognition stock option grants and accounting for stock options accounting for business combinations accounting for variable interest entities goodwill and other intangible assets accounting In particular, new FASB guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition-related charges less predictable in any given reporting period. It is possible that in the future, we may incur less frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to goodwill we have already recorded, as well as goodwill arising out of potential future acquisitions. See ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" for more information on this new FASB guideline. Changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business. See the discussion under ""Critical Accounting Policies"" below for additional information about our critical accounting policies and some risks associated with these policies. We hold equity investments that have recently experienced significant declines in market value. We also have investments, and may continue to make future investments, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the market for the technologies or products they have under development is typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our investment activities can impact our net income. We recorded pre-tax losses from marketable securities and other investments in privately held companies of $17.2 million and $93.4 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts reflect realized losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable equity securities, and net investment losses related to investments in Adobe Ventures and our cost method investments. In fiscal 2002 and 2001, decreases in the market prices of these securities resulted in a decrease in our pre-tax income. Future price fluctuations in these securities and any significant long-term declines in value could reduce our net income in future periods. We are uncertain of future investment gains and losses, as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies. Due to the factors noted above, our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings, or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade, compared to analysts' or investors' expectations could cause, and has caused in the past, an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock. Finally, we participate in a highly dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to us, changes in analysts' earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment, our industry, or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company: revenue recognition, accounting for our marketable and non-marketable fixed income and equity securities, accounting for leases of property and equipment, and accounting for income taxes. Revenue Recognition We recognize application products revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. Application products revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates, and price protection. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection, and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel, and other related factors. We provide free technical phone support for our shrink-wrapped application products to customers who are under warranty for support. We record the estimated cost of free technical phone support upon shipment of software. We also license software in multiple element arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software, post-contract customer support (""PCS""), and/or professional services. PCS, or maintenance, includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, telephone support, updates, and enhancements. Professional services relate to consulting services and training. When vendor specific objective evidence (""VSOE"") of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements. VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We determine VSOE of fair value of PCS based on renewal rates for the same term PCS. In a multiple element arrangement whereby VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but VSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements, revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue, assuming delivery has occurred and collectibility is probable. Revenue allocated to PCS is recognized ratably over the contractual term (typically one to two years). The arrangement fees related to fixed-priced consulting contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method. Percentage of completion is measured monthly based primarily on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Anticipated losses on fixed-priced contracts are recognized in the period when they become known. We record OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEM partners ship products incorporating Adobe software, provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable. Deferred revenue includes customer advances under OEM licensing agreements and maintenance revenue. In cases where we will provide a specified free upgrade to an existing product, we defer revenue until the future obligation is fulfilled. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition and generally do not require collateral. We maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. Accounting for our Marketable and Non-marketable Fixed Income and Equity Securities We classify all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments that are free of trading restrictions, or become free of trading restrictions within one year, as ""available-for-sale."" We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices, and unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recognized when realized in our consolidated statements of income. The market prices in our short-term equity investments have been volatile in the past. It is our policy to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income. The ultimate value realized on these equity investments is subject to market volatility until they are sold. For further information on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, please refer to Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our long-term investments include direct investments and indirect investments in privately held companies. We own limited partnership interests in four venture capital limited partnerships, Adobe Ventures L.P., Adobe Ventures II, L.P., Adobe Ventures III, L.P., and Adobe Ventures IV, L.P. (collectively ""Adobe Ventures""), that invest in early stage companies with innovative technologies. In addition to the potential for financial returns, our venture activities increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies, as well as expand our ecosystem of Adobe products and services. The partnerships are managed by Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures. The investments in Adobe Ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and accordingly, the investments are adjusted to reflect our share of Adobe Ventures' investment income (loss) and dividend distributions. Under the terms of the partnership agreements, the general partner has the sole and exclusive right to manage and control the partnerships. Adobe as the limited partner has certain rights, including replacing the general partner and approving acquisitions that exceed certain established parameters. However, these rights are considered to be protective rights and do not suggest an ability to control the partnerships. Adobe Ventures carry their investments in equity securities at estimated fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in investment gain (loss). The stock of a number of technology investments held by the limited partnerships at November 29, 2002 is not publicly traded, and, therefore, there is no established market for their securities. In order to determine the fair market value of these investments, we use the most recent round of financing involving new non-strategic investors or estimates made by Granite Ventures based on their assessment of the current market value. It is our policy to review the fair value of these investments held by Adobe Ventures on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes, and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of a company is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record a reserve in addition to our equity method of accounting. Estimating the fair value of non-marketable equity investments in early-stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations. We recognize realized gains and losses upon sale or maturity of these investments using the specific identification method. For further information on our long-term investments, please refer to Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Leases of Property and Equipment We entered into two operating lease agreements in 1999 and 2001 (the latter for a building currently under construction) related to our headquarter office buildings in San Jose, California. The agreements qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (""SFAS No. 13""), ""Accounting for Leases,"" and, as such, the buildings are not included on our balance sheet. According to SFAS No. 13, a lease is classified as operating if it does not meet any of the following criteria at its inception: 1) the lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee at the end of the lease term, 2) the lease contains a bargain purchase option, 3) the lease term is equal to 75% or more of the economic life of the leased property, 4) the present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the leased property. These agreements are subject to standard covenants, including liquidity, leverage, and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessors quarterly. We believe we will be able to meet our obligations under the agreements, but if we default on our commitments and are unable to remedy the default quickly enough, the lessors may terminate all remaining commitments (if any remain), and they may demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the current lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. If we are required to purchase the buildings and do not elect to refinance, this will substantially decrease our cash available for working capital and require us to add the value of the buildings to our balance sheet. If we remarket or relinquish the buildings, this could require us to find alternate facilities on terms that may not be as favorable as the current arrangement. As of November 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all covenants. For further information on these leases, please refer to Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, ""Accounting for Income Taxes,"" establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company's financial position or its results of operations. Employee and Director Stock Options Option Program Description Our stock option program is a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract, retain, and provide performance incentives for talented employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. Currently, we grant options from three stock plans (the ""Plans""): 1) the 1994 Stock Option Plan, under which officers and key employees are granted options to purchase shares of our stock, 2) the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, our broad-based plan under which options may be granted to all employees and outside consultants, and 3) the 1996 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended, under which options are granted automatically under a pre-determined formula to non-employee directors. In addition, our stock option program includes the Adobe 1984 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the Aldus 1984 Restated Stock Option Plan from which we currently do not grant options. The plans listed above are collectively referred to in the following discussion as ""the Plans."" We consider our option programs critical to our operation and productivity; essentially all of our employees participate. Option vesting periods are generally three years for all of the Plans. All stock option grants to current executive officers are made after a review by, and with the approval of, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. All members of the Executive Compensation Committee are independent directors, as defined in the rules applicable to issuers traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market. See the ""Report of the Executive Compensation Committee"" appearing in the Company's 2003 Proxy Statement for further information concerning the policies and procedures of the Company and the Executive Compensation Committee regarding the use of stock options. Distribution and Dilutive Effect of Options The table below provides information about stock options granted for 2002, 2001, and, 2000 to our Chief Executive Officer and our four other most highly compensated executive officers as of November 29, 2002, who will also be identified in our 2003 Proxy Statement. This group is referred to as the Named Executive Officers. Please refer to the section headed ""Executive Options"" below for the Named Executive Officers. Options granted to employees, directors and Named Executive Officers for the fiscal years 2000 through 2002 are summarized as follows: Employees, Directors and Named Executive Officers Option Grants in 2002, 2001, and 2000 (1) 2002 2001 2000 Net grants during the period as % of outstanding shares 3% 6% 6% Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of total options granted 21% 11% 15% Net grants to Named Executive Officers during the period as % of Outstanding shares 1% 1% 1% Cumulative options held by Named Executive Officers as % of total options outstanding 15% 12% 10% (1) ""Net grants"" equals the sum of the number of shares subject to options granted during the specified period reduced by the number of shares subject to options which were canceled or otherwise terminated during such period. Net grants as a percentage of outstanding shares is based on 232 million shares, 236 million shares, and 241 million shares of our common stock outstanding as of November 29, 2002, November 30, 2001 and December 1, 2000, respectively. All options and outstanding shares referred to in the above table have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend effected October 24, 2000. During fiscal 2002, we granted options to purchase approximately 12.0 million shares of our stock to our employees and directors, which was a net grant of approximately 7.0 million options after deducting approximately 5.0 million shares for options canceled. For additional information about our employee stock option plan activity for the years 2000 through 2002, and pro forma earnings presentation as if we had accounted for our grant of employee stock options using the fair value method of accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (""SFAS No. 123""), ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"" please refer to Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For fiscal 2002, options granted to the Named Executive Officers amounted to 21% of the grants made to all employees and directors. Options granted to the Named Executive Officers as a percentage of the total options granted to all employees and directors vary from year to year. In 2002, the Named Executive Officers received a higher percentage of total grants than in other years because, although total grants to the Named Executive Officers remained relatively the same, overall there were fewer options granted to all employees. For additional information about the compensation of our executive officers and stock option grants to our Named Executive Officers, please refer to our 2003 Proxy Statement.

(3) Consists of options that are outstanding and shares available for future issuance under our 1999 Equity Incentive Plan (the ""1999 Plan""). Neither the Nasdaq current listing standards nor federal law has required stockholder approval of the 1999 Plan, and accordingly it has not been approved by our stockholders. The material features of the 1999 Plan are described in Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We Disclose Pro Forma Financial Information We prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call. Our pro forma financial information does not include restructuring and other charges, acquired in-process research and development, amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles, gain or loss on the sale of specific assets (e.g. building), and gains and losses on investments in equity securities. We believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our ongoing operations from quarter to quarter and from year to year because it removes certain items from the financial information to more clearly reveal our ongoing operating results. However, we urge investors to carefully review the GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the GAAP financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls, as well as in some of our other reports. The following table shows the Company's pro forma results reconciled to the GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal years ended November 29, 2002, and November 30, 2001, and December 1, 2000. Our pro forma information, including the information presented below, is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our pro forma results for fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000 exclude restructuring and other charges, acquired in-process research and development, amortization and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles, investment gains and losses, and gain on the sale of a building.

Please see our Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma amounts of net income and net income per share that would have resulted if we accounted for our employee stock plans under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (""SFAS No. 142""), ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."" This Statement requires that goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life not be amortized, but be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001; however, for new business combinations that occur after June 30, 2001, SFAS No. 142 is effective. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill resulting from our recent acquisition of Accelio in April 2002 is not amortized. We will fully adopt SFAS No. 142 beginning in our fiscal year 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 142 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Amortization and impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $21.0 million, $14.3 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (""SFAS No. 143""), ""Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."" This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This Statement applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, or normal use of the asset. As used in this Statement, a legal obligation results from existing law, statute, ordinance, written or oral contract, or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We will adopt SFAS No. 143 beginning in our fiscal year 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (""SFAS No. 144""), ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."" This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, ""Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,"" and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 (""APB No. 30""), ""Reporting the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business."" SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We will adopt SFAS No. 144 beginning in our fiscal year 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 (""SFAS No. 145""), ""Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections."" Among other provisions, SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4, ""Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt."" Accordingly, gains or losses from extinguishment of debt shall not be reported as extraordinary items unless the extinguishment qualifies as an extraordinary item under the criteria of APB No. 30. Gains or losses from extinguishment of debt that do not meet the criteria of APB No. 30 should be reclassified to income from continuing operations in all prior periods presented. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. We will adopt SFAS No. 145 beginning in our fiscal year 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 145 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (""SFAS No. 146""), ""Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."" SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Previous guidance, provided under EITF No. 94-3, ""Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including certain costs incurred in a restructuring),"" required an exit cost liability be recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by a company after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In October 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 147 (""SFAS No. 147""), ""Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 72 and 144 and FASB Interpretation No. 9."" The provisions of this statement relate to the application of the purchase method of accounting for all acquisitions of financial institutions, except transactions between two or more mutual enterprises. The provisions of this statement also relate to certain long-term customer-relationship intangible assets recognized in an acquisition of a financial institution, including those acquired in transactions between mutual enterprises. The provisions of this statement are effective on or after October 1, 2002. There will be no material impact upon the adoption of SFAS No. 147 on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (""SFAS No. 148""), ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment to FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."" SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation. The transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 148 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (""FIN No. 45""), ""Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others."" FIN No. 45 expands on the accounting guidance of Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and incorporates without change the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 34, which is being superseded. FIN No. 45 will affect leasing transactions involving residual guarantees, vendor and manufacturer guarantees, and tax and environmental indemnities. All such guarantees will need to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements starting with the period ending after December 15, 2002. For guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, the fair value of the obligation must be reported on the balance sheet. Existing guarantees will be grandfathered and will not be recognized on the balance sheet. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 45 on our financial position and results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (""FIN No. 46""), ""Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities."" FIN No. 46 expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Disclosure requirements apply to any financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The Company has considered the provisions of FIN No. 46 and believes it will not be necessary to include in the Company's financial statements any assets, liabilities, or activities of the entities holding the Company's corporate headquarters leases. The Company has provided certain disclosures in other areas of this filing (see Note 6 and Note 14 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and will continue to evaluate the impact of FIN No. 46 on our financial statements and related disclosures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2002 Change 2001 Change 2000 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $617.7 6 % $581.6 (14 )% $679.9 Working capital $436.9 (4 )% $453.7 (19 )% $563.3 Stockholders' equity $674.3 9 % $617.0 (18 )% $752.5 Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments consist principally of money market funds, U.S. Treasuries, corporate notes, municipal bonds, and marketable equity securities. All of our short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ""Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."" The securities are carried at fair market value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses are recognized when realized in our consolidated statements of income. Cash provided by operating activities was $329.3 million, $418.7 million, and $444.6 million in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The $329.3 million of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended November 29, 2002, was primarily due to net income of $191.4 million, net non-cash related expenses of $118.9 million, and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of $19.0 million. The $418.7 million of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended November 30, 2001, was primarily due to net income of $205.6 million, net non-cash related expenses of $197.1 million, and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of $16.0 million. The $444.6 million of cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 1, 2000, was primarily due to net income of $287.8 million net non-cash related expenses of $173.6 million, partially offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $16.8 million. Our cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 and in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 as a result of decreases in revenue and operating income that occurred primarily as a result of weak economic conditions. Cash used for investing activities was $142.3 million, $26.4 million, and $228.1 million in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The $142.3 million of cash used for investing activities for the year ended November 29, 2002, was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of $91.8 million, purchases of long-term investments and other assets of $38.0 million, and acquisitions of property and equipment of $31.6 million. The cash used for investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $11.7 million and proceeds of $7.3 million related to our Accelio acquisition. The $26.4 million of cash used for investing activities for the year ended November 30, 2001, was primarily due to acquisitions of property and equipment of $43.2 million and purchases of long-term investments and other assets of $35.3 million. The cash used for investing activities was partially offset by net cash provided by short-term investments of $20.6 million and proceeds from the sale of equity securities of $31.5 million. The $228.1 million of cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 1, 2000, was primarily due to net purchases of short-term investments of $137.9 million, purchases of long-term investments and other assets of $59.1 million, and acquisitions of property and equipment of $29.8 million. The cash used for investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sales of equity securities and a building of $17.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in short-term investments and purchase additional property and equipment to support our growth. The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to increased purchases of short-term investments because of lower treasury stock purchases. The decrease in cash used for investment activities in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to a reduction in purchases of short-term and long-term investments in order to purchase treasury stock. Cash used for financing activities was $223.3 million, $409.6 million, and $148.3 million in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The $223.3 of cash used for financing activities for the year ended November 29, 2002, was primarily due to the purchase of $293.2 million of treasury stock and payment of dividends of $11.9 million. Cash used for financing activities in 2002 was offset by proceeds of $81.9 million from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and the sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase. The $409.6 million of cash used for financing activities for the year ended November 30, 2001, was primarily due to the purchase of $485.1 million of treasury stock and payment of dividends of $12.0 million. Cash used for financing activities in 2001 was offset by proceeds of $87.5 million from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and the sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The $148.4 million of cash used for financing activities for the year ended December 1, 2000, was primarily due to the purchase of $255.5 million of treasury stock and payment of dividends of $12.0 million. Cash used for financing activities in 2000 was offset by proceeds of $119.1 million from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and the sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The decrease in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to less cash used for the purchase of treasury stock due to a lower average per share cost. The increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2001 compared to 2000 was due to an increase in the purchase of treasury stock. Trade receivables decreased $9.2 million in 2002 from 2001 and our days sales outstanding (""DSO"") in receivables decreased 6 days in 2002 from 2001. The decrease in trade receivables and DSO was primarily due to our improved collections in 2002. Other receivables increased $12.1 million in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to an increase in indirect tax refund receivables from increased product purchases from our third party manufacturers outside of the U.S. Net property and equipment decreased $6.5 million in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to depreciation and asset retirements. The decrease in net property and equipment was partially offset by an increase related to our India building that we placed into service during fiscal 2002. Other assets increased $4.5 million in 2002 from 2001 due to additional investments in Adobe Ventures. Trade and other payables increased $6.9 million in 2002 from 2001 due to an increase in indirect taxes payable resulting from an increase in foreign sales. Our income tax payable increased approximately $41.1 million in 2002 from 2001 due to an increase in taxable income. Taxable income increased in 2002 over 2001 even though book income did not increase because of certain expenses that are not currently deductible for tax purposes. Also, the company accounts for tax contingencies in the United States and foreign tax jurisdictions in accordance with SFAS No. 5. Please see Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the changes in the income taxes payable account. Deferred revenue increased $9.5 million in 2002 from 2001 primarily due to increased maintenance contracts resulting from our acquisition of Accelio. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2003 due to further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business; customer acceptance of new products and upgrades; delays in shipment of our new products or major new versions of existing products; weakness in demand for application software, computers and printers; downward sales price adjustments; the impact of competition; and other risks detailed in the section ""Factors That May Affect Our Future Performance."" We expect to continue our investing activities, including expenditures for computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to purchase treasury stock and acquire software companies, products, or technologies that are complementary to our business. Adobe's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of stock dividends of our common stock to stockholders effected October 24, 2000. All share and per share amounts referred to in the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this stock split. We have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of 1988. Adobe's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.0125 per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000. The declaration of future dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of Adobe's Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, and other factors. Stock Repurchase Program I -- On-going Dilution Coverage To facilitate our stock repurchase program designed to minimize dilution from stock issuance primarily from employee stock plans, we sold put warrants to independent third parties in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000. Each put warrant entitles the holder to sell one share of Adobe's common stock to Adobe at a specified price for cash or stock at Adobe's option. Approximately 7.5 million, 5.6 million, and 7.0 million put warrants were written in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. At November 29, 2002, approximately 1.9 million put warrants were outstanding that expire through December 2002, with an average exercise price of $26.71 per share, resulting in a total potential cash outlay of approximately $50.5 million in fiscal 2003 if all puts warrants are exercised. In addition, in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, we purchased call options from independent third parties that entitled us to buy 4.9 million, 3.9 million, and 4.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock on certain dates at specified prices. At November 29, 2002, approximately 1.2 million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through December 2002 with an average exercise price of $28.08 per share, resulting in a total potential cash outlay of approximately $34.1 million in fiscal 2003 if all calls options are exercised. Our put and call option contracts provide that, at our option, we can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the option as determined by the contract. We repurchased approximately 8.6 million, 5.9 million, and 7.2 million shares in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, at a cost of $255.0 million, $319.9 million, and $255.5 million, respectively. Subsequent to November 29, 2002, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of $45.1 million through the exercise of outstanding put warrants and call options under this plan. As of December 18, 2002, no put warrants or call options remained outstanding under this plan. The authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances. As of November 29, 2002, 9.6 million shares remained authorized for repurchase, based on net stock issuances less repurchases under this plan. Stock Repurchase Program II -- Additional Authorization above Dilution Coverage In April 1999, the Board authorized a 5.0 million share repurchase program, which allowed us to purchase shares in the open market and enter into contracts to repurchase shares during future quarters by selling put warrants and buying call options. During fiscal 2001, approximately 4.9 million put warrants were written and 3.5 million call options were purchased at prices ranging from $32.60 to $39.58. As of November 30, 2001, there were no put warrants or options outstanding in this program. During fiscal 2001, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares at a cost of $165.2 million. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in fiscal 2000. This program expired in fiscal 2001. In March 2001, subject to certain business and market conditions, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a two-year period. During fiscal year 2002, approximately 3.1 million put warrants were written and approximately 2.1 million call options were purchased under this 5.0 million share repurchase program. As of November 29, 2002, under our March 2001 5.0 million share program, approximately 3.0 million put warrants were outstanding that expire through December 2002 with an average exercise price of $25.20 per share. In addition, as of November 29, 2002, approximately 2.0 million call options were outstanding that expire at various dates through December 2002 with an average price of $27.23 per share. Our put and call option contracts provide that, at our option, we can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the option as determined by the contract. In fiscal 2002, we repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares at a cost of $38.2 million under our March 2001 5.0 million share repurchase program. We did not make any repurchases under this plan in fiscal 2001. During December 2002, all outstanding put warrants and call options under the March 2001 5.0 million share repurchase program expired without any cost to Adobe and as of December 20, 2002, there were no put warrants or call options outstanding. As of December 20, 2002, authorization to repurchase 3.0 million shares remained under the plan until it expires in March 2003. On September 25, 2002, subject to certain business and market conditions, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional 5.0 million shares of our common stock over a three-year period. We have not made any purchases under this 5.0 million share repurchase program. This plan will expire in September 2005. For more information on our puts and calls, please see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The tables below represent our authorized stock repurchase plans and summary of stock repurchases as of November 29, 2002. Authorized Stock Repurchase Plans as of November 29, 2002 (in thousands) Board Approval Date Expiration Date Authorized Shares Repurchases To Date Authorization Expired Put Options Outstanding Remaining Authorization ---------------------- --------------------- -------------- ----------------- ----------------- ---------------- ------------------ December 1997 N/A Ongoing dilution 44,550 N/A 1,890 9,578(1) April 1999 April 2001 5,000 4,687 313 --- --- March 2001 March 2003 5,000 --- --- 2,986 --- September 2002 September 2005 5,000 --- --- --- 5,000 Summary of Stock Repurchases for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000 as of November 29, 2002 (in thousands, except average amounts) Board Approval Date --------------------- Repurchases Under the Plan -------------------- 2002 -------- Average --------- 2001 --------- Average ---------- 2000 --------- Average -------- December 1997 From employees(2) 83 $35.55 733 $42.01 164 $60.98 Open market --- --- 452 35.64 Option exercises 8,517 29.60 4,726 57.78 7,020 34.96 April 1999 Open market --- --- --- --- --- --- Option exercises --- --- 4,687 35.24 --- --- March 2001 Open market 1,899 18.58 --- --- --- --- Option exercises 116 28.58 --- --- --- --- --------- --------- --------- ----------- --------- -------- Total shares 10,615 $27.63 10,598 $45.77 7,184 $35.56 Total cost $293,241 $485,115 $255,456 _______________________ (1) The remaining authorization for the ongoing stock repurchase plan is determined by subtracting repurchases from all stock issuances, net of any canceled shares, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1998. (2) The repurchases from employees represent shares canceled when surrendered in lieu of cash payments for the option exercise price or withholding taxes due. Commitments Our principal commitments as of November 29, 2002, consist of obligations under operating leases, a real estate financing agreement, venture investing activities, royalty agreements, and various service agreements. We expect to fulfill all of the below commitments from our working capital. Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2091. Rent expense, net of sublease income, for these leases aggregated $26.6 million, $22.0 million, and $25.6 million during fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As of November 29, 2002, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, net of sublease income, and future minimum sublease income under noncancelable subleases are as follows: Year Future minimum lease payments (in millions) Future minimum sublease income (in millions) 2003 $19.5 $6.8 2004 $17.4 $6.9 2005 $12.9 $6.8 2006 $10.9 $5.5 2007 $ 7.9 $3.1 2008 and after $34.7 $3.4 In September 2001, we entered into a real estate development agreement for the construction of an additional office building for our corporate headquarters in downtown San Jose, California. Under the agreement, the lessor will finance up to $117.0 million over a two-year period, toward the construction and associated costs of the building. As part of the agreement, we entered into a five-year lease beginning upon completion of the building. We have the option to purchase the building at any time during the term for an amount equal to the lease balance. The agreement and lease are subject to standard covenants including liquidity, leverage and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessor quarterly. As of November 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may terminate all remaining commitments (if any remain) and they may demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the current lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. The agreement qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS No. 13, and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included on our balance sheet, but the lease payments are reflected in the schedule of future minimum lease payments. At the end of the lease term, we can either purchase the building for the lease balance, which will be approximately $117.0 million, remarket, or relinquish the building. If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, up to the maximum recourse amount of $103.0 million. In August 1999, Adobe entered into a five-year lease agreement for our corporate headquarters office buildings in San Jose, California. Under the agreement, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time during the lease term for the lease balance, which is approximately $142.5 million. The lease is subject to standard covenants including liquidity, leverage and profitability ratios that are reported to the lessor quarterly. As of November 29, 2002, we were in compliance with all covenants. In the case of a default the lessor may demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. The agreement qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS No. 13, and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included on our balance sheet, but the lease payments are reflected in the schedule of future minimum lease payments. At the end of the lease term, we can either purchase the building for the lease balance, remarket, or relinquish the building. If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, up to the maximum recourse amount of $132.6 million. Line of Credit In August 1999, Adobe entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility of $100.0 million with a group of banks, for general corporate purposes, subject to certain financial covenants. The facility expired in August 2002 and we elected not to renew the facility. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income, was approximately $14.4 million, $14.1 million, and $20.8 million in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Adobe Ventures We have commitments to the Adobe Venture limited partnerships. The following table shows the capital commitments and the capital contributed as of November 29, 2002: Capital Commitment -------------------------------- Capital Contributed ------------------------------ (in thousands) (in thousands) Adobe Ventures L.P. $ 40,000 $ 40,476 Adobe Ventures II, L.P. $ 40,000 $ 37,541 Adobe Ventures III, L.P. $ 60,000 $ 57,353 Adobe Ventures IV, L.P. $ 100,000 $ 35,418 The capital commitment is the amount that Adobe has agreed to contribute to the Partnership. The capital commitment amount is contributed over the term of each Partnership, which is ten years. We can contribute more than the capital commitment, at our discretion. We can cease funding at any time after the earlier of: a) two years after the effective date of the Partnership or b) the date on which the Company has made capital contributions to the Partnership in an amount in excess of $10.0 million, $10.0 million, $20.0 million, and $33.0 million for Adobe Ventures L.P., Adobe Ventures II, L.P., Adobe Ventures III, L.P., and Adobe Ventures IV, L.P., respectively. In addition to these venture partnerships, we have direct investments in public and privately-held companies. In total, as of November 29, 2002, we have invested $213.9 million through our venture partnerships and direct investments. As of November 29, 2002, net returns were $348.7 million, including stock dividends and net gains in market value of investments. Legal Actions On September 3, 2002, Adobe filed suit in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (""the California Action""), against International Typeface Corporation (""ITC"") and Agfa Monotype Corporation (""AMT""), companies which have common ownership and management, seeking a declaration that (a) Adobe's distribution of font software, which generates ITC typefaces, did not breach its contract pursuant to which Adobe licensed certain rights with respect to ITC typefaces, and (b) Adobe did not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA"") with respect to, or induce or contribute to the infringement of copyrights in, ITC's and AMT's TrueType font software. AMT had previously asserted that Adobe had committed such breach of contract and violation of the DMCA. On September 4, 2002, Adobe initiated arbitration proceedings in London, England (""the London Arbitration"") against AMT, seeking a declaration that Adobe's distribution of font software that generates AMT typefaces did not breach its contract pursuant to which it licensed certain rights with respect to AMT typefaces. AMT has made a breach of contract claim in response to Adobe's arbitration demand in the London Arbitration, asserting that Adobe wrongfully granted and/or allowed third parties greater rights to distribute and embed AMT fonts than Adobe was licensed to grant and/or allow. If AMT prevails on its breach of contract claims, AMT may have the right to terminate Adobe's right to distribute any of its products that then still contain font software that generates AMT typefaces. Adobe asserts that it negotiated for and obtained express, written licenses from both AMT and ITC approximately ten years ago permitting Adobe to allow end users to embed AMT and ITC fonts in electronic documents for ""print and view"" and disputes the other breach of contract claims. Adobe also asserts that Adobe Acrobat 5.0, which AMT and ITC correctly acknowledge has been superceded by version 5.05, neither violates the DMCA nor induces or contributes to the infringement of copyrights in ITC's and AMT's TrueType font software. On September 5, 2002, AMT and ITC filed suit against Adobe in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Illinois (""the Illinois Action"") against Adobe, asserting only that Adobe's distribution of the superceded 5.0 version of Adobe Acrobat violated the DMCA, as described above. The Illinois Action seeks statutory damages of $200-$2,500 for each copy of Acrobat 5.0 found to violate the DMCA, a claim that Adobe disputes as a matter of law and fact. The Illinois Action also seeks injunctive relief with respect to Acrobat 5.0, although it specifically alleges, correctly, that Adobe no longer distributes Acrobat 5.0. On November 13, 2002, ITC filed another suit against Adobe in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois (""the Second Illinois Action""), this time asserting that Adobe breached its contract with ITC and that ITC, and not Adobe, owns the copyrights in font software created by Adobe which generates ITC typefaces. AMT and ITC made a motion to dismiss the California action, challenging jurisdiction and venue. That motion was granted by the court on December 16, 2002. As such, the parties' respective claims will be resolved in the other actions described above. The results of any litigation are inherently uncertain, and AMT and ITC may assert other claims. Adobe cannot assure that it will be able to successfully defend itself against any of the actions described above. AMT and ITC seek an unspecified aggregate dollar amount of damages. A favorable outcome for AMT or ITC in these actions could have a material adverse effect on Adobe's business, financial condition and operating results. We strongly believe that all of AMT's and ITC's claims are without merit, and will vigorously defend against them in addition to pursuing our own claims as described above. On September 6, 2002, Plaintiff Fred B. Dufresne filed suit against Adobe, Microsoft Corporation, Macromedia, Inc., and Trellix Corporation in the U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,835,712, entitled ""Client-Server System Using Embedded Hypertext Tags For Application And Database Development."" The plaintiff's Complaint asserts that ""Defendants have infringed, and continue to infringe one or more claims of the '712 patent by making, using, selling and/or offering for sale, inter alia, products supporting Microsoft Active Server Pages technology."" The plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, trebling of damages for ""willful infringement,"" and fees and costs. Adobe strongly disagrees with the plaintiff's claims and intends to vigorously defend against this action. On November 18, 2002, Plaintiffs Shell & Slate Software Corporation and Ben Weiss filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against the Company alleging false designation of origin, trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and other causes of action. The claim derives from the Plaintiffs' belief that the ""healing brush"" technique of Adobe Photoshop incorporates Plaintiffs' trade secrets. Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, compensatory, treble, and punitive damages, and fees and costs. We believe that the action has no merit and intend to defend vigorously against it. From time to time Adobe is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, in addition to those identified above, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Adobe makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, Adobe believes that it has valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against it, as well as adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that cash flows or results of operations could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Derivatives and Financial Instruments (Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) Foreign Currency Hedging Instruments We transact business in various foreign currencies, primarily in certain European countries and Japan. Accordingly, we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure is primarily related to revenue from yen-denominated licenses in Japan and euro-denominated licenses in certain European countries. Our Japanese operating expenses are in yen, and our European operating expenses are primarily in euro, which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated licenses. In addition, we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts. These contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses; however, the gains and losses on these contracts typically offset or partially offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts. Our revenue hedging policy is designed to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements. At November 29, 2002, total outstanding contracts included the equivalent of $72.4 million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of $65.2 million. As of November 29, 2002, all contracts were set to expire at various times through June 2003. The bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk we only contract with high quality counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements. In addition, our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty. Economic Hedging -- Hedges of Forecasted Transactions We use option and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational (""cash flow"") exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have a duration between one to twelve months. Such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen and the euro. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business, and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 29, 2002, there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. The critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying forecasted transactions. The changes in fair value of the derivatives are intended to offset changes in the expected cash flows from the forecasted transactions. We record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in other income on the consolidated statement of income. The time value of purchased derivative instruments is deemed to be ineffective and is recorded in other income over the life of the contract. Balance Sheet Hedging - Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income (loss). These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 29, 2002, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 90 days or less. A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 29, 2002. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% and 15% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% and 15% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar (and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset) would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $12.1 million and $18.5 million, respectively. Conversely, a 10% and 15% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $9.0 million and $13.1 million, respectively. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. As a general rule, we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where these expenses create a natural hedge against foreign currency receivables. For example, in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures, primarily related to operating expenses, on an ongoing basis. We regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program. Equity Investments We are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities. As of November 29, 2002, our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at $14.1 million compared to $37.8 million at November 30, 2001, a decrease of 63%. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could experience further adverse changes in the near term. It is our policy to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Our policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, earnings/revenue outlook, stock price performance over the past six months, liquidity and management/ownership. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of our marketable equity securities, it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related writedown in our consolidated statements of income. The following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market. Fair value deteriorations of 50%, 35%, and 15% were selected based on the probability of their occurrence. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Potential decrease to the value of securities given X% decrease in each stock's price ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (50%) (35%) (15%) Fair Value as of November 29, 2002 -------------------------------- --------- -------------- -------------- ------------------------- Marketable equity securities $ (7.0) $ (4.9) $ (2.1) $14.1 -------------------------------- --------- -------------- -------------- ------------------------- Fixed Income Investments At November 29, 2002, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $581.7 million compared to $521.8 million at November 30, 2001, an increase of 11%. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 29, 2002. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Potential decrease to the value of fixed income securities given X% increase in interest rates. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% ---------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------- ------------------ 6 - month horizon $ (2.9) $ (5.7) $ (8.5) ---------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------- ------------------ 12 - month horizon $ (2.5) $ (4.9) $ (7.4) ---------------------------------- -------------------- ------------------- ------------------ We limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios. At the present time, the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to 2.3 years. The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to any one security issue, limits on exposure to any one issuer, and limits on exposure to the type of instrument. The limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines do reduce the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk; however, dramatic changes to interest rates could result in material changes to the market value of our fixed income securities. Interest Rate Hedging Instruments We are exposed to interest rate risk on the operating lease obligations for some of our facilities that are tied to short-term interest rates (LIBOR). As short-term interest rates rise, it may negatively impact our net income. Our policy permits us to hedge this interest rate risk using swap agreements. The swap agreements exchange variable interest rate payments for fixed interest rate payments with high quality counterparties. Our swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133 because they hedge against changes in the amount of future cash flows. The critical terms of the cash flow hedging instruments are the same as the underlying obligation, so the change in fair value of the swaps is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. If, for some reason, the terms of the hedge no longer matched the underlying obligation, a portion of the swap may become ineffective. Under SFAS No. 133, the change in value of the ineffective portion would be recognized in other income (loss) on the consolidated statement of income. Our swaps mature at various dates through the third quarter of fiscal 2004, consistent with the expiration of the underlying obligation. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our interest rate hedges as of November 29, 2002. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of minus 50, 100, or 150 basis points over six-month and twelve-month time horizons. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Potential decrease to the value of fixed income securities given X% increase in interest rates. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% ---------------------------------- ------------------- ------------------ ------------------ 6 - month horizon $ (0.7) $ (1.5) $ (2.2) ---------------------------------- ------------------- ------------------ ------------------ 12 - month horizon $ (0.5) $ (1.0) $ (1.4) ---------------------------------- ------------------- ------------------ ------------------ Privately Held Investments We have direct investments, as well as indirect investments through Adobe Ventures, in several privately held companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or development stages. These investments are inherently risky, as the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, and we could lose a substantial part of our entire initial investment in these companies. It is our policy to review privately-held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each of the companies' cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes, and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately-held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies.",2023-12-30 17:04:28.005230
