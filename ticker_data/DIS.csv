It includes the following sections: •Consolidated Results and Non-Segment Items•Business Segment Results — 2019 vs. 2018 •Business Segment Results — 2018 vs. 2017 •Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses•Restructuring in Connection With the Acquisition of TFCF•Significant Developments•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Forward-Looking StatementsCONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMSThe Company’s financial results for fiscal 2019 are presented in accordance with new accounting guidance for revenue recognition (ASC 606) that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Prior period results have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting guidance. Segment operating income for fiscal 2019 includes a $91 million benefit from the adoption of ASC 606 primarily due to the timing of recognition of TV/SVOD distribution revenue at Studio Entertainment. Further information about our adoption of ASC 606 is provided in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.2019 vs. 2018 As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company acquired TFCF on March 20, 2019. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of TFCF, we acquired a controlling interest in Hulu. The Company began consolidating the results of TFCF and Hulu effective March 20, 2019.Revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 17%, or $10.1 billion, to $69.6 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased 12%, or $1.5 billion, to $11.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney (EPS) decreased 25%, or $2.09 to $6.27. The decrease in EPS was due to the comparison to a benefit in fiscal 2018 from U.S. federal income tax legislation (Tax Act), which was enacted in fiscal 2018 (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), amortization expense on intangibles and the fair value step-up on film and television costs from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu, an increase in shares outstanding and restructuring costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF. The increase in shares outstanding was due to shares that were issued in connection with the acquisition of TFCF. Additionally, the decrease in EPS reflected lower segment operating income, which included a $0.5 billion adverse impact from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu in the current year, the absence of a gain recognized in the prior year on the sale of real estate, a charge in the current year for the extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a non-cash gain recognized in the current year in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hulu (Hulu Gain) (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Segment operating income from our legacy operations decreased due to higher losses at Direct-to-Consumer & International and lower results at Media Networks, partially offset by growth at Parks, Experiences and Products.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 19%, or $9.7 billion, to $60.5 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu’s operations and to a lesser extent, growth at our legacy operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher guest spending at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, higher theatrical distribution revenue and growth in merchandise licensing. These increases were partially offset by lower ABC Studios program sales. Service revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (Foreign Exchange Impact).Product revenues for fiscal 2019 increased 5%, or $0.5 billion, to $9.0 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF’s operations and growth at our legacy operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to guest spending growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.30TABLE OF CONTENTSCosts and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2019 increased 32%, or $8.9 billion, to $36.5 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu’s operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. The increase in costs at our legacy operations reflected higher programming and production costs, labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts and an increase in film cost amortization. Cost of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Cost of products for fiscal 2019 increased 7%, or $0.4 billion, to $5.6 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF's operations and higher costs at our legacy operations. The increase in costs at our legacy operations was due to higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise and labor cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment volumes. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2019 increased 30%, or $2.7 billion, to $11.5 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu’s operations, and increases in marketing and compensation costs at our legacy operations. Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 2 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Depreciation and amortization costs increased 38%, or $1.1 billion, to $4.2 billion due to amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of TFCF and consolidation of Hulu.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesThe Company recorded $1.2 billion and $33 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Charges in fiscal 2019 were due to severance in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF. Charges in fiscal 2018 were due to severance costs.Other Income, net(in millions) 2019 2018 % Change Better/(Worse) Hulu Gain $4,794 $— nm Insurance recoveries related to legal matters 46 38 21 % Charge for the extinguishment of a portion of the debt originally assumed in the TFCF acquisition (511) — nm Gain on sale of real estate, property rights and other 28 563 (95)% Other income, net $4,357 $601 >100 % In fiscal 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of $4,794 million in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hulu.In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, the Company recorded insurance recoveries of $46 million and $38 million, respectively, in connection with the settlement of legal matters.In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a charge of $511 million for the extinguishment of a portion of the debt originally assumed in TFCF acquisition.In fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a gain of $28 million on the deemed settlement of preexisting relationships with TFCF pursuant to acquisition accounting guidance. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded gains of $560 million in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights in New York City and a $3 million adjustment to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain of $255 million recorded in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech.31TABLE OF CONTENTSInterest Expense, net(in millions) 2019 2018 % Change Better/(Worse) Interest expense $(1,246) $(682) (83)% Interest income, investment income and other 268 108 >100 % Interest expense, net $(978) $(574) (70)% The increase in interest expense was due to higher average debt balances as a result of the TFCF acquisition and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. These increases were partially offset by higher capitalized interest and a benefit from market value adjustments on pay-floating interest rate swap options.The increase in interest income, investment income and other for the year was due to a $102 million benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost, and higher interest income on cash balances. The comparable benefit related to pension and postretirement benefit costs of $30 million in the prior year was reported in “Costs and expenses.” The benefit in the current year was due to the expected return on pension plan assets exceeding interest expense on plan liabilities and amortization of prior net actuarial losses.Equity in the Loss of InvesteesEquity in the loss of investees of $103 million was comparable to the prior year as higher impairments in the current year were offset by lower equity losses from Hulu as a result of our consolidation of Hulu following the TFCF acquisition.Effective Income Tax Rate 2019 2018 ChangeBetter/(Worse)Effective income tax rate - continuing operations21.7% 11.3% (10.4)pptThe increase in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Act, of which the most significant impacts were a $1.7 billion net benefit (11 percentage points) that was recognized in the prior year, partially offset by a current year benefit from a reduction in the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 21% in fiscal 2019 from 24.5% in fiscal 2018.Noncontrolling Interests(in millions) 2019 2018 % Change Better/(Worse) Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests $(472) $(468) (1)% Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was comparable to the prior year as the accretion of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Hulu (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and a lower loss allocation to the noncontrolling interest holders of BAMTech were offset by a higher loss from our direct-to-consumer sports business.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.Discontinued OperationsNet income from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the RSNs.2018 vs. 2017 Revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 8%, or $4.3 billion, to $59.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased 40%, or $3.6 billion, to $12.6 billion; and EPS for the year increased 47%, or $2.67 to $8.36. The EPS increase in fiscal 2018 was due to a benefit from the Tax Act, higher segment operating income, a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchase program and gains on the sale of real estate and property rights. These increases were partially 32TABLE OF CONTENTSoffset by the comparison to a fiscal 2017 non-cash net gain in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech, impairments of our Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments in fiscal 2018 and higher net interest and corporate and unallocated shared expenses. The increase in segment operating income was due to growth at our Studio Entertainment, Parks, Experiences and Products and Media Networks segments, partially offset by lower results at our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. In addition, net income attributable to Disney reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, or $4.0 billion, to $50.9 billion, due to higher theatrical distribution revenue, growth in guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts, an increase in affiliate fees, increased TV/SVOD distribution revenue and the consolidation of BAMTech. In September 2017, the Company increased its ownership in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue.Product revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 3%, or $0.3 billion, to $8.6 billion, due to guest spending and volume growth at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in retail store sales. Product revenue reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, or $2.2 billion, to $27.5 billion, due to higher film and television cost amortization driven by an increase in theatrical and TV/SVOD distribution revenue and contractual rate increases for television programming. Costs of services also increased due to the consolidation of BAMTech and higher costs at our theme parks and resorts reflecting cost inflation, higher technology and operations support expenses and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus.Cost of products for fiscal 2018 increased 4%, or $0.2 billion, to $5.2 billion due to cost inflation and higher guest spending and volumes at our theme parks and resorts. Cost of products reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2018 increased 8%, or $0.7 billion, to $8.9 billion, due to higher marketing spend, the consolidation of BAMTech, costs incurred in connection with the TFCF acquisition and an increase in compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization costs increased 8%, or $0.2 billion, to $3.0 billion primarily due to depreciation of new attractions at our theme parks and resorts and the consolidation of BAMTech. Depreciation and amortization costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point increase due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesThe Company recorded $33 million and $98 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Charges in fiscal 2018 were due to severance costs. Charges in fiscal 2017 were due to severance costs and asset impairments.Other Income, net(in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Better/(Worse) Gain on sales of real estate and property rights $560 $— nm Insurance recoveries (settlements) related to legal matters 38 (177) nm Gain related to the acquisition of BAMTech 3 255 (99)% Other income, net $601 $78 >100 % In fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $177 million in connection with the settlement of a litigation matter, net of committed insurance recoveries, and a gain of $255 million in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech.33TABLE OF CONTENTSInterest Expense, net(in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Better/(Worse) Interest expense $(682) $(507) (35)% Interest and investment income 108 122 (11)% Interest expense, net $(574) $(385) (49)% The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average interest rates, higher average debt balances and financing costs related to the acquisition of TFCF.The decrease in interest and investment income for fiscal 2018 was due to the comparison to gains on investments recognized in fiscal 2017, partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher average interest rates.Equity in the income (loss) of investees, netEquity in the income of investees decreased $422 million, to a loss of $102 million due to higher losses from Hulu, impairments of Vice and Villages Nature equity method investments and lower income from A+E. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in fiscal 2017. The decrease at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue. The decrease at A +E was due to lower advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales.Effective Income Tax Rate 2018 2017 Change Better/(Worse) Effective income tax rate11.3% 32.1% 20.8pptThe decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of the Tax Act, which included:•A net benefit of $1.7 billion, which reflected a $2.1 billion benefit from remeasuring our deferred tax balances to the new statutory rate (Deferred Remeasurement), partially offset by a charge of $0.4 billion for a one-time tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings (Deemed Repatriation Tax). This benefit had an impact of approximately 11.5 percentage points on the effective income tax rate.•A reduction in the Company’s fiscal 2018 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to 24.5% from 35.0% in fiscal 2017. Net of state tax and other related effects, the reduction in the statutory rate had an impact of approximately 8.2 percentage points on the effective income tax rate.Noncontrolling Interests(in millions) 2018 2017 % Change Better/(Worse) Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests $(468) $(386) (21)% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2018 increased $82 million to $468 million due to lower tax expense at ESPN, largely due to the Tax Act, and the impact of the Company’s acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in Disneyland Paris in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. These increases were partially offset by losses at BAMTech.Certain Items Impacting ComparabilityResults for fiscal 2019 were impacted by the following:•The Hulu Gain of $4.8 billion•A benefit of $74 million consisting of $46 million from insurance recoveries related to a legal matter and a gain of $28 million recognized on the settlement of preexisting relationships with TFCF pursuant to acquisition accounting guidance•A benefit of $34 million from the Tax Act•Amortization of $1.6 billion related to TFCF and Hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs34TABLE OF CONTENTS•Restructuring and impairment charges of $1.2 billion•Impairments of $538 million on equity investments•A charge of $511 million for the extinguishment of a portion of debt originally assumed in the TFCF acquisitionResults for fiscal 2018 were impacted by the following:•A benefit of $1.7 billion from the Tax Act Deferred Remeasurement, net of the Deemed Repatriation Tax•A benefit of $601 million comprising $560 million in gains from the sales of real estate and property rights, $38 million from insurance recoveries in connection with the settlement of a fiscal 2017 litigation matter and $3 million from an adjustment related to a non-cash gain recognized in fiscal 2017 for the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech•Impairments of $210 million for Vice and Villages Nature equity investments•Restructuring and impairment charges of $33 millionResults for fiscal 2017 were impacted by the following:•A non-cash net gain of $255 million in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in BAMTech•A charge, net of committed insurance recoveries, of $177 million in connection with the settlement of litigation•Restructuring and impairment charges of $98 millionA summary of the impact of these items on EPS is as follows:(in millions, except per share data)Pre-Tax Income/(Loss) Tax Benefit/(Expense)(1) After-Tax Income/(Loss) EPS Favorable/(Adverse) (2)Year Ended September 28, 2019: Hulu Gain$4,794 $(1,103) $3,691 $2.22Insurance recoveries and gains on the settlement of preexisting relationships74 (17) 57 0.03Benefit from the Tax Act— 34 34 0.02Amortization of TFCF and Hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs, net of gain(3)(1,595) 355 (1,240) (0.74)Restructuring and impairment charges(1,183) 273 (910) (0.55)Impairment of equity investments(538) 123 (415) (0.25)Charge for the extinguishment of debt(511) 118 (393) (0.24)Total$1,041 $(217) $824 $0.50 Year Ended September 29, 2018: Net benefit from the Tax Act$— $1,701 $1,701 $1.11Gain from sale of real estate, property rights and other601 (158) 443 0.30Impairment of equity investments(210) 49 (161) (0.11)Restructuring and impairment charges(33) 7 (26) (0.02)Total$358 $1,599 $1,957 $1.28 Year Ended September 30, 2017: Settlement of litigation$(177) $65 $(112) $(0.07)Restructuring and impairment charges(98) 31 (67) (0.04)Gain related to the acquisition of BAMTech255 (93) 162 0.10Total$(20) $3 $(17) $(0.01)(1) Tax benefit/expense adjustments are determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item affecting comparability.(2) EPS is net of noncontrolling interest share, where applicable.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.Our Media Networks segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising (excluding addressable ad sales) and other revenues, which include the sale and distribution of television programs. Significant expenses include amortization of programming and production costs, participations and residuals expense, technical support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing intellectual properties and sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.Our Studio Entertainment segment generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and TV/SVOD markets, stage play ticket sales and licensing of our intellectual properties for use in live entertainment productions. Significant expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, marketing and sales costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.Our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising sales (includes addressable ad sales), subscription fees for our DTC streaming and other services, and fees charged for technology support services. Significant expenses include operating expenses, selling general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses include programming and production costs (including programming, production and branded digital content obtained from other Company segments), technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. The following table reconciles income from continuing operations before income taxes to total segment operating income. % ChangeBetter/(Worse)(in millions)2019 2018 2017 2019vs.2018 2018vs.2017Income before income taxes$13,944 $14,729 $13,788 (5)% 7 %Add/(subtract): Corporate and unallocated shared expenses987744582 (33)% (28)%Restructuring and impairment charges1,183 33 98 >(100)% 66 %Other income, net(4,357) (601) (78) >100 % >100 %Interest expense, net978 574 385 (70)% (49)%Amortization of TFCF and Hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs (1)1,595 — — nm nmImpairment of equity investments538 210 — >(100)% nmTotal segment operating income$14,868 $15,689 $14,775 (5)% 6 %(1) Includes amortization of intangibles related to TFCF equity investees36TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following is a summary of segment revenue and operating income: % ChangeBetter/(Worse)(in millions)2019 2018 2017 2019vs.2018 2018vs.2017Revenues: Media Networks$24,827 $21,922 $21,299 13 % 3 %Parks, Experiences and Products26,225 24,701 23,024 6 % 7 %Studio Entertainment11,127 10,065 8,352 11 % 21 %Direct-to-Consumer & International9,349 3,414 3,075 100 % 11 %Eliminations(1,958) (668) (613) >(100)% (9)% $69,570 $59,434 $55,137 17 % 8 %Segment operating income / (loss): Media Networks$7,479 $7,338 $7,196 2 % 2 %Parks, Experiences and Products6,758 6,095 5,487 11 % 11 %Studio Entertainment2,686 3,004 2,363 (11)% 27 %Direct-to-Consumer & International(1,814) (738) (284) >(100)% (100)%Eliminations(241) (10) 13 >(100)% nm $14,868 $15,689 $14,775 (5)% 6 %Media NetworksOperating results for the Media Networks segment are as follows: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Revenues Affiliate fees$13,433 $11,907 13 % Advertising6,965 6,586 6 % TV/SVOD distribution and other4,429 3,429 29 % Total revenues24,827 21,922 13 % Operating expenses(15,499) (13,197) (17)% Selling, general, administrative and other(2,361) (1,899) (24)% Depreciation and amortization(191) (199) 4 % Equity in the income of investees703 711 (1)% Operating Income$7,479 $7,338 2 % RevenuesThe increase in affiliate fees was due to increases of 8% from the consolidation of TFCF’s operations and 7% from higher contractual rates, partially offset by a decrease of approximately 2 and one-half percent from fewer subscribers.The increase in advertising revenues was due to increases of $374 million at Cable Networks, from $3,129 million to $3,503 million and $5 million at Broadcasting, from $3,457 million to $3,462 million. Cable Networks advertising revenue reflected increases of 11% from the consolidation of TFCF’s operations and 2% from higher impressions reflecting higher units delivered, partially offset by lower average viewership. Broadcasting advertising revenue was comparable to the prior-year period as increases of 7% from higher network rates and 2% from the consolidation of TFCF’s operations were offset by a decrease of 9% from average viewership. 37TABLE OF CONTENTSTV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $1,000 million, due to sales of TFCF programs, partially offset by a decrease in ABC Studios program sales. The decrease in ABC Studios program sales reflects the prior-year sales of Daredevil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist, partially offset by the current-year sale of The Punisher.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $2,142 million from $12,555 million to $14,697 million. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $1,255 million due to the consolidation of TFCF’s operations and contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $887 million due to the consolidation of TFCF’s operations, partially offset by the impact of lower ABC Studios program sales.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased from $1,899 million to $2,361 million due to the consolidation of TFCF’s operations.Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income increased 2%, or $141 million, to $7,479 million due to the consolidation of TFCF’s operations, partially offset by lower income from ABC Studios program sales.The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Revenues Cable Networks$16,486 $14,610 13 % Broadcasting8,341 7,312 14 % $24,827 $21,922 13 % Segment operating income Cable Networks$5,425 $5,225 4 % Broadcasting1,351 1,402 (4)% Equity in the income of investees703 711 (1)% $7,479 $7,338 2 % Items Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Media NetworksThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Media Network segment that are excluded from segment operating income: Year Ended (in millions)September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 % ChangeBetter/(Worse)Amortization of TFCF intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs(1)$(684) $— nmRestructuring and impairment charges(105) (2) >(100) %Impairment of equity investments(184) — >(100) %(1) Amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $359 million and amortization of intangible assets was $325 million.38TABLE OF CONTENTSParks, Experiences and ProductsOperating results for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are as follows: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 Revenues Theme park admissions$7,540 $7,183 5 % Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage5,963 5,674 5 % Resorts and vacations6,266 5,938 6 % Merchandise licensing and retail4,519 4,249 6 % Parks licensing and other1,937 1,657 17 % Total revenues26,225 24,701 6 % Operating expenses(14,015) (13,326) (5)% Selling, general, administrative and other(3,133) (2,930) (7)% Depreciation and amortization(2,306) (2,327) 1 % Equity in the loss of investees(13) (23) 43 % Operating Income$6,758 $6,095 11 % RevenuesThe increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to an increase of 8% from higher average ticket prices, partially offset by decreases of 2% from lower attendance and 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in attendance was due to lower attendance at Shanghai Disney Resort. Attendance at our domestic theme parks was comparable to the prior year.Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to an increase of 6% from higher average guest spending, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from lower volumes.The increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 2% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from an increase in average ticket prices for cruise line sailings and 1% from the consolidation of TFCF's operations.Merchandise licensing and retail revenue growth was due to increases of 3% from merchandise licensing, 1% from our retail stores, 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact and 1% from our publishing business due to the consolidation of TFCF's operations. The increase in merchandise licensing revenues was primarily due to higher revenue from products based on Toy Story, an increase in guaranteed shortfall recognition and higher revenues from Avengers and Frozen merchandise. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from products based on Star Wars and Cars. Higher revenues at our retail stores were due to an increase in online sales. The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was due to the adoption of ASC 606 and higher real estate sales. The adoption of ASC 606 required certain cost reimbursements from licensees to be recognized as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses.39TABLE OF CONTENTS The following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: Domestic International (2) Total Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2018Parks Increase/ (decrease) Attendance—% 4% (7)% 4% (2)% 4%Per Capita Guest Spending7% 6% 13 % 5% 8 % 6%Hotels (1) Occupancy90% 88% 81 % 84% 88 % 87%Available Room Nights(in thousands)10,030 10,045 3,182 3,179 13,212 13,224Per Room Guest Spending$353 $345 $330 $315 $348 $338 (1)Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, including the impact of wage increases for union employees, partially offset by the comparison to a special domestic employee bonus that was recognized in fiscal 2018. The increase in cost of sales and distribution costs was driven by higher sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts. Higher infrastructure costs were due to an increase in technology spending and costs for new guest offerings, including expenses associated with Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings, increased $199 million, from $2,255 million to $2,454 million, due to the recognition of certain cost reimbursements from licensees as revenue rather than recorded as an offset to operating expenses.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $203 million from $2,930 million to $3,133 million primarily due to inflation and higher marketing spend at our parks and resorts.

These increases were partially offset by two Marvel titles, Avengers: Endgame and Captain Marvel and no Star Wars title in the current year compared to four Marvel titles, Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and the Wasp, and two Star Wars titles, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Solo: A Star Wars Story in the prior year. The current year also included Toy Story 4 and Ralph Breaks the Internet, while the prior year included Incredibles 2 and Coco. Higher home entertainment revenue was due to an increase of 16% from the consolidation of TFCF’s operations, partially offset by decreases of 9% from lower unit sales and 1% from a decrease in net effective pricing at our legacy operations. The decrease in unit sales was due to the release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the prior year compared to no Star Wars release in the current year. Other significant titles in release included Avengers: Endgame, Incredibles 2, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Ralph Breaks the Internet in the current year and Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Coco and Cars 3 in the prior year. 41TABLE OF CONTENTSHigher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to an increase of 14% from TV/SVOD distribution, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from Lucasfilm’s special effects business due to fewer projects.

The decrease at Cable Networks was due to a decrease of 6% from lower impressions as lower average viewership was partially offset by higher units delivered. The decrease at Broadcasting was due to decreases of 7% from lower network impressions and 2% from lower impressions at the owned television stations, both of which were driven by lower average viewership. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher network rates. TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue increased $392 million due to higher ABC Studios program sales driven by increased revenue from programs licensed to Hulu and higher sales of Grey’s Anatomy and Black-ish. Additionally, fiscal 2018 included the sales of Luke Cage, Daredevil and Jessica Jones compared to fiscal 2017 sales of The Punisher and The Defenders.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $486 million from $12,069 million to $12,555 million.

At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $169 million due to contractual rate increases for college sports, NFL, NBA and MLB programming, partially offset by lower production costs. Equity in the Income of InvesteesIncome from equity investees decreased $55 million from $766 million to $711 million due to lower income from A+E driven by decreased advertising revenue and higher programming costs, partially offset by higher program sales. Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income increased 2%, or $142 million, to $7,338 million due to higher program sales and an increase at the Domestic Disney Channels, partially offset by lower income from equity investees.The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Revenues Cable Networks$14,610 $14,416 1 % Broadcasting7,312 6,883 6 % $21,922 $21,299 3 % Segment operating income Cable Networks$5,225 $5,174 1 % Broadcasting1,402 1,256 12 % Equity in the income of investees711 766 (7)% $7,338 $7,196 2 % 45TABLE OF CONTENTSParks, Experiences and ProductsOperating results for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are as follows: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Revenues Theme park admissions$7,183 $6,504 10 % Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage5,674 5,154 10 % Resorts and vacations5,938 5,378 10 % Merchandise licensing and retail4,249 4,494 (5)% Parks licensing and other1,657 1,494 11 % Total revenues24,701 23,024 7 % Operating expenses(13,326) (12,455) (7)% Selling, general, administrative and other(2,930) (2,896) (1)% Depreciation and amortization(2,327) (2,161) (8)% Equity in the loss of investees(23) (25) 8 % Operating Income$6,095 $5,487 11 % RevenuesThe increase in theme park admissions revenue was due to increases of 6% from higher average ticket prices, 4% from attendance growth and 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Attendance growth included a favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew at Walt Disney World Resort.Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increases of 5% from higher average guest spending, 3% from volume growth and 2% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Volume growth included a benefit from the favorable comparison to the fiscal 2017 impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Matthew.The increase in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 3% from higher average daily hotel room rates, 1% from higher average ticket prices for cruise line sailings, 1% from a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact, 1% from an increase in passenger cruise ship days and 1% from higher occupied hotel room nights. Higher occupied hotel room nights were due to an increase at our international resorts, partially offset by a decrease at our domestic resorts, reflecting fewer available room nights at Walt Disney World Resort due to room refurbishments and conversions to vacation club units.Merchandise licensing and retail revenues were lower primarily due to decreases of 2% from licensing, 2% from lower retail sales and 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in revenue from licensing was driven by a decrease in licensee settlements and lower revenues from products based on Frozen, Cars and Princess, partially offset by an increase from products based on Mickey and Minnie and Avengers. Lower retail revenue was driven by a decrease in comparable store sales at The Disney Stores, partially offset by higher online revenue. The decrease in comparable store sales reflected lower sales of Star Wars and Moana merchandise in the fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher sales of Mickey and Minnie merchandise.The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to an increase in real estate rental and sponsorship revenues.46TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: Domestic International (2) Total Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017Parks Increase/ (decrease) Attendance4% 2% 4% 47 % 4% 13 %Per Capita Guest Spending6% 2% 5% (1)% 6% (1)%Hotels (1) Occupancy88% 88% 84% 80 % 87% 86 %Available Room Nights(in thousands)10,045 10,205 3,179 3,022 13,224 13,227Per Room Guest Spending$345 $317 $297 $289 $334 $311(1) Per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at the hotels.

The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher volumes, an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact and a special fiscal 2018 domestic employee bonus. The increase in cost of goods sold and distribution costs was due to higher volumes and inflation. Higher infrastructure costs were driven by increased technology spending at our theme parks and resorts and inflation. Other operating expenses, which include costs such as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings increased $141 million from $2,114 million to $2,255 million due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact, inflation and new guest offerings at our theme parks and resorts. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $34 million from $2,896 million to $2,930 million primarily due to inflation and higher technology spending, partially offset by lower costs at our games business. Depreciation and amortization increased $166 million from $2,161 million to $2,327 million primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and asset impairments in fiscal 2018.Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income increased 11%, or $608 million, to $6.1 billion due to growth at our domestic and international Parks & Experiences, partially offset by decreases at our merchandise licensing and retail businesses.47TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment to provide continuity with our legacy reporting: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Supplemental revenue detail Parks & Experiences Domestic$16,161 $14,812 9 %International4,135 3,603 15 %Consumer Products4,405 4,609 (4) % $24,701 $23,024 7 %Supplemental operating income detail Parks & Experiences Domestic$4,013 $3,464 16 %International456 310 47 %Consumer Products1,626 1,713 (5) % $6,095 $5,487 11 %Studio EntertainmentOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Revenues Theatrical distribution$4,303 $2,903 48 % Home entertainment1,647 1,677 (2)% TV/SVOD distribution and other4,115 3,772 9 % Total revenues10,065 8,352 21 % Operating expenses(4,449) (3,718) (20)% Selling, general, administrative and other(2,493) (2,156) (16)% Depreciation and amortization(119) (115) (3)% Operating Income$3,004 $2,363 27 % RevenuesThe increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the release of four Marvel titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two Marvel titles in fiscal 2017. The Marvel titles in fiscal 2018 were Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok and Ant-Man and the Wasp, whereas fiscal 2017 included Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Doctor Strange. Other significant titles in fiscal 2018 included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Incredibles 2 and Coco, while fiscal 2017 included Beauty and the Beast, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Moana.Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 5% decrease from lower unit sales, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher average net effective pricing. Lower unit sales were driven by the success of Moana and Finding Dory in fiscal 2017 compared to Coco and Cars 3 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was also driven by three live-action titles in fiscal 2017 as compared to two live-action titles in fiscal 2018 and the carryover performance of fiscal 2016 new release titles in fiscal 2017 compared to the carryover performance of fiscal 2017 new release titles in fiscal 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the release of three Marvel titles and two Lucasfilm titles in fiscal 2018 compared to two Marvel titles and one Lucasfilm title in fiscal 2017. The increase in average net effective pricing was due to higher rates and a higher sales mix of Blu-ray discs, partially offset by a lower mix of new release titles. TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue reflected a 5% increase from TV/SVOD distribution and a 3% increase from stage plays. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution revenue was due to an increase in our free television business driven by 48TABLE OF CONTENTSnew international agreements and the sale of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in fiscal 2018 with no comparable title in fiscal 2017. Higher stage play revenue was due to the opening of additional productions in fiscal 2018. Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses include film cost amortization, which increased $625 million, from $2,562 million to $3,187 million and cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which increased $106 million, from $1,156 million to $1,262 million. Higher film cost amortization was due to the impact of higher theatrical distribution revenues. Higher cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to an increase in stage play production and theatrical distribution costs. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $337 million from $2,156 million to $2,493 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs reflecting more titles released in fiscal 2018 and, to a lesser extent, higher stage play marketing costs due to additional productions in fiscal 2018.Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income increased 27%, or $641 million to $3,004 million due to an increase in theatrical distribution results.Direct-to-Consumer & InternationalOperating results for the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment are as follows: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Revenues Affiliate fees$1,372 $1,335 3 % Advertising1,311 1,293 1 % Subscription fees and other731 447 64 % Total revenues3,414 3,075 11 % Operating expenses(2,384) (1,983) (20)% Selling, general, administrative and other(1,003) (861) (16)% Depreciation and amortization(185) (94) (97)% Equity in the income of investees(580) (421) (38)% Operating Income$(738) $(284) >(100)% RevenuesThe increase in affiliate fees was due to an increase of 5% from higher contractual rates, partially offset by a decrease of 2% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Advertising revenue increased 1% as higher addressable ad sales were largely offset by lower revenue generated from content distributed on YouTube.Other revenue increased $284 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech. In fiscal 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. The Company’s share of BAMTech’s results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees. Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses included a $147 million increase in programming and production costs, from $1,425 million to $1,572 million and a $254 million increase in other operating expenses, from $558 million to $812 million. The increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower talent costs for digital programming. Other operating costs, which include technical support and distribution costs, increased due to the consolidation of BAMTech.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $142 million from $861 million to $1,003 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech, partially offset by lower marketing costs at our International Channels. Depreciation and amortization increased $91 million from $94 million to $185 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech. 49TABLE OF CONTENTSEquity in the Loss of InvesteesLoss from equity investees increased $159 million from a loss of $421 million to a loss of $580 million primarily due to a higher loss from our investment in Hulu, partially offset by a favorable comparison to a loss from BAMTech in fiscal 2017. On September 25, 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BAMTech and began consolidating its results. The Company’s share of BAMTech’s results was previously reported in equity in the loss of investees. The higher loss at Hulu was driven by higher programming, labor and marketing costs, partially offset by growth in subscription and advertising revenue.Segment Operating LossSegment operating loss increased $454 million, to $738 million due to the consolidation of BAMTech and a higher loss from Hulu, partially offset by growth at our International Channels.The following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income/(loss) detail for the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to provide information on International Channels that were historically reported in the Media Networks segment: Year Ended % ChangeBetter /(Worse)(unaudited; in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Supplemental revenue detail International Channels$1,920 $1,853 4 % DTC businesses and other1,494 1,222 22 % $3,414 $3,075 11 % Supplemental operating income/(loss) detail International Channels$311 $233 33 % DTC businesses and other(469) (96) >(100)% Equity in the loss of investees(580) (421) (38)% $(738) $(284) >(100)% EliminationsIntersegment content transactions are as follows: Year Ended % Change(in millions)September 29, 2018 September 30, 2017 Better/(Worse)Revenues Studio Entertainment: Content transactions with Media Networks$(169) $(137) (23) %Content transactions with Direct-to-Consumer & International(28) (22) (27) %Media Networks: Content transactions with Direct-to-Consumer & International(471) (454) (4) %Total$(668) $(613) (9) % Operating income Studio Entertainment: Content transactions with Media Networks$(8) $15 nmContent transactions with Direct-to-Consumer & International— — nmMedia Networks: Content transactions with Direct-to-Consumer & International(2) (2) — %Total$(10) $13 nm50TABLE OF CONTENTSCORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSESCorporate and unallocated shared expenses are as follows: % ChangeBetter/(Worse) (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019vs.2018 2018vs.2017 Corporate and unallocated shared expenses $(987) $(744) $(582) (33)% (28)% The increases in corporate and unallocated shared expenses from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 and from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 were due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of TFCF and higher compensation costs. RESTRUCTURING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF TFCFAs discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in connection with the acquisition of TFCF the Company has begun implementing a restructuring and integration plan as a part of its initiative to realize cost synergies from the acquisition of TFCF. During fiscal 2019, we recorded charges of $1.2 billion, including $0.9 billion of severance and related costs in connection with the plan and $0.3 billion of equity-based compensation costs, primarily for TFCF awards that were accelerated to vest upon the closing of the TFCF acquisition. These charges are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Although our plans are not yet finalized, we anticipate that the total severance and related costs could be on the order of $1.5 billion. The Company may incur other restructuring costs, such as contract termination costs, but we expect these will not be material. For fiscal 2018, restructuring and impairment charges were not material.The following table summarizes the changes in restructuring reserves related to TFCF integration efforts in fiscal 2019: BeginningBalance Additions Payments Other EndingBalanceRestructuring reserves$— $906 $(230) $— $676SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTSIn November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based direct-to-consumer streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming in the U.S. and four other countries. Further launches are planned for Western Europe in spring 2020, Latin America in fall 2021, Eastern Europe starting in late 2020 and continuing in 2021, and various Asia-Pacific territories throughout 2020 and 2021. As we will use our branded film and television content on the Disney+ service, we expect to forgo licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets. In addition, we anticipate an increase in programming and production investments to create exclusive content for Disney+.Due to the circumstances in Hong Kong, we have seen a significant decrease in tourism from China and other parts of Asia to Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. If current trends continue, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort's fiscal 2020 operating income could decrease by approximately $275 million compared to fiscal 2019.51TABLE OF CONTENTSLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash is as follows: (in millions) 2019 2018 2017Cash provided by operations - continuing operations $5,984 $14,295 $12,343Cash used in investing activities - continuing operations (15,096) (5,336) (4,111)Cash used in financing activities - continuing operations (464) (8,843) (8,959)Cash provided by operations - discontinued operations 622 — —Cash provided by investing activities - discontinued operations 10,978 — —Cash used in financing activities - discontinued operations (626) — —Impact of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (98) (25) 31Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $1,300 $91 $(696)Operating ActivitiesContinuing operationsCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 decreased 58% or $8.3 billion to $6.0 billion compared to fiscal 2018 due to the payment of approximately $7.6 billion of tax obligations that arose from the spin-off of Fox Corporation in connection with the TFCF acquisition and the sale of the RSNs acquired with TFCF, higher pension plan contributions and higher interest payments. Lower operating cash flows at our DTCI and Media Networks segments were largely offset by increases at Parks, Experiences and Products and Studio Entertainment. The decreases at DTCI and Media Networks were due to higher film and television spending and operating disbursements, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. The increases at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experiences and Products were due to higher operating cash receipts driven by increases in revenue. The increase at Studio Entertainment was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. The increase at Parks, Experiences and Products was partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by cost inflation and higher marketing expenses.Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 increased 16% or $2.0 billion to $14.3 billion compared to fiscal 2017 due to a decrease in tax payments resulting from the Tax Act, a decrease in pension plan contributions and higher operating cash flows at Studio Entertainment and Parks, Experiences and Products, partially offset by lower operating cash flows at Media Networks and DTCI and a payment for the rights to develop a real estate property in New York. The increase in operating cash flow at Studio Entertainment was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operating cash disbursements driven by higher marketing expenses. Parks, Experiences and Products cash flow reflected higher operating cash receipts due to increased revenue, partially offset by higher payments for labor and other costs. Lower operating cash flow at Media Networks was due to higher television production spending. The decrease in operating cash flow at DTCI was due to higher operating cash disbursements.Depreciation expense is as follows:(in millions) 2019 2018 2017Media Networks Cable Networks $107 $111 $122Broadcasting 84 88 84Total Media Networks 191 199 206Parks, Experiences and Products Domestic 1,474 1,449 1,371International 724 768 679Total Parks, Experiences and Products 2,198 2,217 2,050Studio Entertainment 74 55 50Direct-to-Consumer & International 207 106 74Corporate 167 181 206Total depreciation expense $2,837 $2,758 $2,58652TABLE OF CONTENTSAmortization of intangible assets is as follows:(in millions) 2019 2018 2017Media Networks $— $— $—Parks, Experiences and Products 108 110 111Studio Entertainment 61 64 65Direct-to-Consumer & International 111 79 20TFCF and Hulu 1,043 — —Total amortization of intangible assets $1,323 $253 $196The Company’s Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and DTCI segments incur costs to acquire and produce feature film and television programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for use on the Company’s broadcast, cable networks, television stations or DTC services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.The Company’s film and television production and programming activity related to continuing operations for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:(in millions) 2019 2018 2017Beginning balances: Production and programming assets $9,202 $8,759 $7,547Programming liabilities (1,178) (1,106) (1,063) 8,024 7,653 6,484Spending: Television program licenses and rights 10,517 7,770 7,406Film and television production 7,104 5,590 5,319 17,621 13,360 12,725Amortization: Television program licenses and rights (10,608) (7,966) (7,595)Film and television production (6,471) (4,871) (4,055) (17,079) (12,837) (11,650)Change in film and television production andprogramming costs 542 523 1,075Film and television production costs from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu, net of programming liabilities assumed 14,227 — —Other non-cash activity 11 (152) 94Ending balances: Production and programming assets 27,407 9,202 8,759Programming liabilities (4,061) (1,178) (1,106) $23,346 $8,024 $7,65353TABLE OF CONTENTSDiscontinued operationsCash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the RSNs.Investing ActivitiesContinuing operationsInvesting activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:(in millions) 2019 2018 2017Media Networks Cable Networks $93 $96 $64Broadcasting 81 107 67Parks, Experiences and Products Domestic 3,294 3,223 2,392International 852 677 827Studio Entertainment 88 96 85Direct-to-Consumer & International 258 107 30Corporate 210 159 158 $4,876 $4,465 $3,623Capital expenditures for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The increase in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort, partially offset by lower spending on new attractions at Disneyland Resort, while the increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on new attractions at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, including Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. The increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to higher spending at Disneyland Paris, while the decrease in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to lower spending at Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.Capital expenditures at DTCI primarily reflect investments in technology. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to spending on technology to support our DTC services.Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was driven by investments in corporate facilities.The Company currently expects its fiscal 2020 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.5 billion higher than fiscal 2019 capital expenditures of $4.9 billion due to increased spending on technology and facilities at DTCI and Corporate.Other Investing ActivitiesThe fiscal 2019 spending of $9.9 billion on acquisitions reflects $35.7 billion of cash paid to acquire TFCF less $25.7 billion of cash acquired in the transaction (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash used in other investing activities of $319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of $347 million to Hulu prior to the consolidation of Hulu.The fiscal 2018 spending of $1.6 billion on acquisitions was for the September 2017 acquisition of an additional 42% of BAMTech. Cash provided by other investing activities of $710 million in fiscal 2018 reflected $1.2 billion of cash received in connection with the sales of real estate and property rights, partially offset by contributions of $442 million to Hulu.The fiscal 2017 spending of $417 million on acquisitions was for the January 2017 acquisition of additional interests in BAMTech net of cash assumed upon the consolidation of BAMTech. Cash used in other investing activities of $71 million in fiscal 2017 reflected $266 million of contributions to joint ventures and investment purchases, partially offset by $173 million of proceeds from investment dispositions.Discontinued operationsCash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the RSNs.54TABLE OF CONTENTSFinancing ActivitiesContinuing operationsCash used in financing activities was $0.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $8.8 billion in fiscal 2018. The net use of cash in the current year was due to $2.9 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from borrowing of $3.7 billion. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was due to a net increase in borrowings in the current year compared to net repayments in the prior year ($3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018) and the absence of common stock repurchases in the current year (compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2018), partially offset by acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in the current year ($1.4 billion in fiscal 2019).Cash used in financing activities was $8.8 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.0 billion in fiscal 2017. The net use of cash in fiscal 2018 was due to $3.6 billion of common stock repurchases, $2.5 billion in dividends and a net repayment of borrowings of $2.6 billion. Cash used in financing activities was comparable to fiscal 2017 as lower common stock repurchases ($3.6 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $9.4 billion in fiscal 2017) and higher contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $0.4 billion was essentially offset by a net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2018 compared to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2017 ($2.6 billion repayment in fiscal 2018 compared to $3.7 billion borrowing in fiscal 2017).Discontinued operationsCash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the RSNs.Borrowings activities and otherDuring the year ended September 28, 2019, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:(in millions) September 29, 2018 Borrowings Payments Borrowings Assumed in Acquisition of TFCF OtherActivity September 28, 2019Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months (1) $50 $1,881 $— $— $3 $1,934Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months 955 6,889 (4,452) — 16 3,408U.S. dollar denominated notes 18,045 6,930 (7,044) 21,174 319 39,424Asia Theme Parks borrowings 1,145 — (47) — 16 1,114Foreign currency denominated debt and other (2) 679 210 (690) 549 358 1,106Credit facilities to acquire TFCF — 31,100 (31,100) — — — 20,874 47,010 (43,333) 21,723 712 46,986Liabilities held for sale (3) — 50 (68) 1,069 (1,051) — $20,874 $47,060 $(43,401) $22,792 $(339) $46,986(1) Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.(2) The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.(3) The other activity is due to the sale of the RSNs in fiscal 2019.See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s bank facilities. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. However, the Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. In addition to macroeconomic factors, the Company’s borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of 55TABLE OF CONTENTSSeptember 28, 2019, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, Standard and Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and A-1, and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A and F1, respectively. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on September 28, 2019, by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSThe Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. For example, the Company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at September 28, 2019 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table: Payments Due by Period(in millions) Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 4-5Years More than5 YearsBorrowings (Note 9)(1) $65,888 $10,398 $10,021 $6,516 $38,953Operating lease commitments (Note 15) 5,931 982 1,519 939 2,491Capital lease obligations (Note 15) 549 19 39 33 458Sports programming commitments (Note 15) 43,940 8,878 15,613 9,315 10,134Broadcast programming commitments (Note 15) 6,474 2,599 2,277 946 652Total sports and other broadcast programming commitments 50,414 11,477 17,890 10,261 10,786Other(2) 12,918 3,210 3,292 2,218 4,198Total contractual obligations(3) $135,700 $26,086 $32,761 $19,967 $56,886(1)Excludes market value adjustments, which reduce recorded borrowings by $31 million.

For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Film and Television Revenues and CostsWe produce films and television series for distribution in the theatrical and television markets and on our DTC streaming services. We expense the production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for each production. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. For film productions, Ultimate Revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. For television series, Ultimate Revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.With respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g. the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. Home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products, as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.With respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings and the strength of the advertising market. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the Company’s ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. In addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the licensing of program rights worldwide to television distributors, SVOD services and in home entertainment formats. Alternatively, poor ratings may result in cancellation of the program, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. A significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates. We expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on an accelerated or straight-line basis over the useful life or over the number of times the program is expected to be aired, as appropriate. Amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. The number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program’s ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. Accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. We amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. The estimated value of each year is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.We also acquire, license and produce films and television series for our direct-to-consumer streaming platforms. We expense these costs based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, which may be on an accelerated or straight-line basis, as appropriate. Costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. The net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. The Company’s dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). The net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. Individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. 57TABLE OF CONTENTSEstimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.For film and television series that are exploited on our direct-to-consumer streaming services, the unamortized costs are reviewed for impairment on an aggregate basis for each service.Fixed license fees charged for the right to use our television and motion picture productions are recognized as revenue when the content is available for use by the licensee. TV/SVOD distribution contracts may contain more than one title and/or provide that certain titles are only available for use during defined periods of time during the contract term. In these instances, each title and/or period of availability is generally considered a separate performance obligation. For these contracts, license fees are allocated to each title and period of availability at contract inception based on relative standalone selling price using management's best estimate. Estimates used to determine a performance obligation's standalone selling price impact the timing of revenue recognition, but not the total revenue to be recognized under the arrangements.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. We have updated our revenue recognition policies in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance as further described in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We reduced our discount rate to 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 from 4.31% at the end of fiscal 2018 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2019 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $313 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 28, 2019 by approximately $3.6 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $273 million and $3.0 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.25%. A lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense, while a higher expected rate of return on pension plan assets will decrease pension expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $157 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. The Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. We apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. In addition, the projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property as if it was licensed to an unrelated third party. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.58TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. If the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group’s long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group’s long-lived assets. The impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. The Company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment. The impairment charges recorded for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material.For fiscal 2019, the fair value of our International Channels reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by less than 10%. Our International Channels reporting unit comprises the Company’s international cable networks that provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs. A majority of the operations in this reporting unit consist of businesses acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value approximates carrying value. Goodwill of this reporting unit is approximately $3 billion. Changes to key assumptions, market trends, or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record an impairment charge.The Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company tested its investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $538 million and $210 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 impairment charges were recorded in “Equity in the income (loss) of investees, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The fiscal 2017 impairment charges recorded were not material.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we may also be involved in other contingent matters for which we have accrued estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income Tax AuditsAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. The acquisition of TFCF increased the Company’s uncertain tax benefits as the Company assumed the tax liabilities of TFCF. The Company is still obtaining information related to the evaluation of the 59TABLE OF CONTENTSincome tax impact of certain pre-acquisition transactions of TFCF which may result in adjustments to the recorded amount of uncertain tax benefits. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the SEC and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. These statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. There can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel, oil and gasoline.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.60TABLE OF CONTENTSValue at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.VAR on a combined basis increased to $322 million at September 28, 2019 from $44 million at September 29, 2018 driven by an increase in borrowings and higher interest rate volatility of our debt.The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions): Fiscal 2019 Interest RateSensitiveFinancialInstruments CurrencySensitiveFinancialInstruments Equity SensitiveFinancialInstruments Commodity Sensitive Financial Instruments CombinedPortfolioYear end fiscal 2019 VAR $317 $28 $1 $2 $322Average VAR 180 25 1 2 63Highest VAR 317 28 1 2 322Lowest VAR 39 23 1 1 51Year end fiscal 2018 VAR 32 32 1 1 44The VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of September 28, 2019 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table.",2023-12-30 17:48:26.220645

It includes the following sections:•Significant Developments•Consolidated Results and Non-Segment Items•Business Segment Results •Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses•Restructuring Activities•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information•Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Forward-Looking StatementsIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2020 and 2019 results and comparisons of fiscal 2020 results to fiscal 2019 results. Discussions of fiscal 2018 results and comparisons of fiscal 2019 results to fiscal 2018 results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019.SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTSStrategic ReorganizationIn October 2020, the Company announced a strategic reorganization of our media and entertainment businesses to accelerate the growth of our DTC strategy. The operations of the Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and DTCI segments were reorganized into four groups: three content groups (Studios, General Entertainment and Sports), which are focused on developing and producing content that will be used across all of our traditional and DTC platforms and a distribution group, which is focused on distribution and commercialization activities across these platforms and which has full accountability for media and entertainment operating results globally.COVID-19 PandemicDuring fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at Parks, Experiences and Products where our theme parks were closed or operating at significantly reduced capacity for a significant portion of the year, cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended since late in the second quarter and retail stores were closed for a significant portion of the year. We also had an adverse impact on our merchandise licensing business. Our Studio Entertainment segment has delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled, theatrical releases, and stage play performances have been suspended since late in the second quarter. We also had adverse impacts on advertising sales at Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer & International. Since March 2020, we have experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the shift of key live sports programming from our third quarter to the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021, as well as the suspension of production of most film and television content since late in the second quarter, although some film and television production resumed in the fourth quarter.We have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses. We have significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020, and we entered into an additional $5.0 billion credit facility in April 2020. The Company (or our Board of Directors, as applicable) did not declare a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations; suspended certain capital projects; reduced certain discretionary expenditures (such as spending on marketing); reduced management compensation for several months and temporarily eliminated Board of Director retainers and committee fees. In addition, we furloughed over 120,000 of our employees (who continued to receive Company provided medical benefits), many of which have returned from furlough as certain business operations have reopened. At the end of September, the Company announced a workforce reduction plan that would primarily impact Parks, Experiences and Products. Overall, approximately 32,000 employees will be terminated in the first half of fiscal 2021. We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; reducing, or not making, certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; further suspending capital spending, reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses.35TABLE OF CONTENTSThe most significant impact of COVID-19 on fiscal 2020 operating results was an estimated detriment of approximately $6.9 billion on operating income at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment due to revenue lost as a result of the closures or reduced operating capacities. The impacts at the Media Networks, Direct-to-Consumer & International and Studio Entertainment segments were less significant. Media Networks had a modest benefit reflecting the deferral of sports programming costs to fiscal 2021, when we expect rescheduled events to occur, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer & International, lower advertising revenue was partially offset by lower costs including the deferral of sports programming costs into fiscal 2021. At Studio Entertainment, lower revenues due to the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases as a result of theater closures were partially offset by lower amortization, marketing and distribution costs. In total, we estimate the net adverse impact of COVID-19 on our full year segment operating income across all of our businesses was approximately $7.4 billion, inclusive of the impact at Parks, Experiences and Products. The estimated impact is net of approximately $500 million in government credits, from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) in the U.S. and a similar program in France, both primarily at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The impact in fiscal 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results, including the impact of sports programming cost deferrals.The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. While we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impacts of COVID-19, we currently expect COVID-19 to adversely impact our financial results at least through fiscal 2021.Some of our businesses have reopened with limited operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, talent and guests. For example, as we reopened theme parks and retail stores, we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services, personal protection equipment, temperature screenings and testing, sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage, among other items. As we resume production of film and television content, including live sporting events, we anticipate incurring similar costs and productions may take longer to complete. The timing, duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations. We currently estimate these costs may total approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021. Some of these costs may be capitalized and amortized over future periods. With the unknown duration of COVID-19 and yet to be determined timing of the phased reopening of certain businesses, it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in future quarters. As we reopen our businesses, we will no longer benefit from certain savings related to the closure of those businesses, such as related furloughs. The reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements, which vary by location, are subject to ongoing changes, which could result from increasing COVID-19 cases.Additionally, see Part I., Item 1A. Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.Direct-to-ConsumerIn November 2019, the Company launched Disney+, a subscription based DTC streaming service with Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic branded programming in the U.S. and four other countries and has expanded to select Western European countries in the Spring of 2020. In April 2020, our Hotstar service in India was converted to Disney+Hotstar, and in June 2020, current subscribers of the Disney Deluxe service in Japan were converted to Disney+. In September 2020, Disney+ was launched in additional European countries and Disney+ Hotstar was launched in Indonesia. In November 2020, Disney+ was launched in Latin America. Additional launches are planned for various Asia-Pacific territories in calendar year 2021.The Company also plans to launch a general entertainment DTC video streaming offering under the Star brand outside the U.S. in calendar year 2021.As we will use our branded film and television content on our DTC offerings, we are forgoing certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets. We also expect to forgo revenue as we shut down channels in certain markets as a result of investment in our DTC offerings. In addition, we are increasing programming and production investments to create exclusive content for our DTC offerings.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMSFiscal 2019 includes the consolidated results of TFCF and Hulu for the period March 20, 2019 through September 28, 2019, whereas the fiscal 2020 results include the consolidated results of TFCF and Hulu for the full year. We refer to the impact of the approximately six month non-comparable period as “the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu”.36TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company’s fiscal year end is on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. Fiscal 2020 is a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020. We estimate that the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre-tax income of approximately $200 million, primarily at the Media Networks segment.Revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 6%, or $4.2 billion, to $65.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased $13.9 billion, to a loss of $2.9 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney decreased to a loss of $1.57 compared to income of $6.26 in the prior year. The EPS decrease for the year was due to lower segment operating income, goodwill and intangible asset impairments at our International Channels business, the comparison to a prior-year non-cash gain in connection with the acquisition of Hulu (Hulu gain), higher amortization of intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs from the TFCF acquisition and the consolidation of Hulu and higher interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by an investment gain in the current year and the comparison to investment impairments and a charge for the extinguishment of debt recorded in the prior year. The decrease in segment operating income was due to lower results at Parks, Experiences and Products and higher losses at Direct-to-Consumer & International, partially offset by an increase at our Media Networks segment. Segment operating results for the current period include a $0.5 billion net benefit from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 2%, or $1.3 billion, to $59.3 billion, driven by lower volumes at our theme parks, resorts and cruise line, a decrease in theatrical distribution and stage play revenues, lower advertising revenue and a decrease in sales of our television and film programs to third parties. These decreases were partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu and an increase in subscription revenue from Disney+/Disney+Hotstar and Hulu. Theme park, resort, cruise line, theatrical distribution, stage play and advertising revenue were adversely impacted by COVID-19.Product revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased 32%, or $2.9 billion, to $6.1 billion, due to lower volumes at our theme parks and resorts, which were impacted by being closed or operating at reduced capacity for a significant part of the year as a result of COVID-19.Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2020 increased 8%, or $2.9 billion, to $39.4 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu and an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by lower theatrical and TV/SVOD production cost amortization and distribution costs and decreased volumes at our theme parks, resorts and cruise line. The increase in programming and production costs reflected costs for Disney+ programming, partially offset by a decrease due to a shift in timing of major sporting events to fiscal 2021.Cost of products for fiscal 2020 decreased 20%, or $1.1 billion, to $4.5 billion, due to lower volumes at our theme parks and resorts.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2020 increased 7%, or $0.8 billion, to $12.4 billion, due to the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu, partially offset by lower marketing costs. The decrease in marketing costs reflected lower spending at the theatrical distribution and theme parks and resorts businesses, partially offset by increased spend for Disney+.Depreciation and amortization costs increased 28%, or $1.2 billion, to $5.3 billion due to the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of TFCF and consolidation of Hulu and, to a lesser extent, higher depreciation for new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges of $5.7 billion for fiscal 2020 were due to $4,953 million of impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels business and $782 million of restructuring costs. Restructuring costs were primarily for severance costs and contract termination charges in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF and severance in connection with the reduction-in-force at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment.Restructuring and impairment charges of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2019 were primarily for severance and equity-based compensation costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF.37TABLE OF CONTENTSOther Income, net(in millions)20202019% ChangeBetter (Worse)DraftKings Gain$973 $— nmGain on sale of an investment65 — nmHulu Gain— 4,794 nmInsurance recoveries related to legal matters— 46 nmGain recognized in connection with the acquisition of TFCF— 28 nmCharge for the extinguishment of a portion of the debt originally assumed in the TFCF acquisition— (511) nmOther income, net$1,038 $4,357 (76) %In fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of $973 million to adjust its investment in DraftKings, Inc. to fair value (DraftKings gain).

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.Our Media Networks segment primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising (excluding addressable ad sales) and the sale and distribution of television programs in TV/SVOD markets. Significant expenses include amortization of programming and production costs, participations and residuals expense, technical support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing intellectual properties and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.Our Studio Entertainment segment primarily generates revenue from the distribution of films in the theatrical, home entertainment and TV/SVOD markets, stage play ticket sales and licensing of our intellectual properties for use in live entertainment productions. Significant expenses include amortization of production, participations and residuals costs, marketing and sales costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.Our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment primarily generates revenue from subscription fees for our DTC streaming services, affiliate fees and advertising sales (including addressable ad sales). Significant expenses include operating expenses, selling general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses include programming and production costs (including programming, production and branded digital content obtained from other Company segments), technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.

The subscriber decline was net of a benefit from the ACC Network which launched in August 2019.The decline in advertising revenues was due to decreases of $392 million at Cable Networks, from $3,503 million to $3,111 million and $199 million at Broadcasting, from $3,462 million to $3,263 million. Cable Networks advertising revenue reflected a decrease of 22% from lower impressions reflecting lower average viewership due to the impact COVID-19 had on live sports events. This decrease was partially offset by increases of 7% from the consolidation of TFCF, 4% from the benefit of an additional week of operations, which included MLB and NBA events, and 2% from higher rates. Broadcasting advertising revenue reflected decreases of 9% from lower network impressions reflecting lower average viewership and 3% from the owned television stations. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 3% from higher network rates, 2% from the benefit of an additional week of operations and 2% from the consolidation of TFCF.The increase in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue of $2,572 million was due to the consolidation of TFCF, which consisted primarily of program sales, and higher program sales at Disney Television Studios, Disney Channel and FX. The increase in Disney Television Studios was primarily due to sales of original titles to Hulu and library titles to Hulu and 41TABLE OF CONTENTSDisney+. The increases at Disney Channel and FX were due to program sales to Disney+ and Hulu, respectively. These increases were partially offset by lower sales to third parties.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses include programming and production costs, which increased $1,857 million from $14,697 million to $16,554 million. At Cable Networks, programming and production costs increased $435 million due to the consolidation of TFCF, contractual increases for college football, NFL and NBA programming, higher program sales and costs for the ACC Network. These increases were partially offset by the deferral of costs for NBA, MLB and college football to fiscal 2021 when these events occurred or are scheduled to occur. At Broadcasting, programming and production costs increased $1,422 million due to the consolidation of TFCF and higher program sales at Disney Television Studios, partially offset by lower costs driven by production shutdowns and delays as a result of COVID-19.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $153 million from $2,361 million to $2,514 million due to the consolidation of TFCF, partially offset by lower marketing costs at the ABC Television Network, FX Networks and ESPN due to the impact of COVID-19.Equity in the Income of InvesteesIncome from equity investees increased $34 million, from $703 million to $737 million, driven by higher income from A+E Television Networks due to lower programming costs and higher program sales, partially offset by lower advertising revenue.Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income increased 21%, or $1,543 million, to $9,022 million due to the consolidation of TFCF and increases at ESPN, the FX Networks, Disney Television Studios and the ABC Television Network.The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Media Networks segment: Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3, 2020September 28, 2019Supplemental revenue detailCable Networks$17,966 $16,486 9 %Broadcasting10,427 8,341 25 %$28,393 $24,827 14 %Supplemental operating income detailCable Networks$6,283 $5,425 16 %Broadcasting2,002 1,351 48 %Equity in the income of investees737 703 5 %$9,022 $7,479 21 %Items Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Media NetworksThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Media Network segment that are excluded from segment operating income:Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3,2020September 28,2019Amortization of TFCF intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs(1)$(1,305) $(684) (91) %Restructuring and impairment charges(51) (105) 51 %Impairment of equity investments— (184) — %(1)In the current year, amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $695 million and amortization of intangible assets was $610 million.

Our parks were closed for a significant portion of the fiscal year due to COVID-19, and those that reopened were operating at significantly reduced capacity.Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue was lower compared to the prior year due to a decrease of 48% from lower volumes, partially offset by an increase of 4% from higher average guest spending.The decrease in resorts and vacations revenue was due to decreases of 22% from lower occupied room nights and 15% from fewer passenger cruise days driven by the suspension of cruise ship sailings. Merchandise licensing and retail revenue was lower due to decreases of 4% from retail and 3% from merchandise licensing. The decrease in revenues at retail was driven by the closure of our retail stores for a significant portion of the fiscal year as a result of COVID-19 and the prior-year sale of rights to a video game, partially offset by higher online sales. The decrease at merchandise licensing was primarily due to lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition and a decrease in sales of merchandise based on Toy Story, Avengers and Disney Classics, partially offset by higher sales of Frozen merchandise. Merchandise licensing revenues for the current year were adversely impacted by COVID-19. The decrease in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to lower sponsorship revenue and a decrease in royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort, which was closed or operating at reduced capacity for a significant portion of the fiscal year.43TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: DomesticInternational(1)Total Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019ParksIncrease (decrease)Attendance(2)(47) %— %(53) %(7) %(49) %(2) %Per Capita Guest Spending(3)8 %7 %(3) %13 %7 %8 %HotelsOccupancy(4)43 %90 %35 %81 %41 %88 %Available Room Nights (in thousands)(5)11,11410,0303,2073,18214,32113,212Per Room Guest Spending(6)$367$353$312$316$356$345(1)Per capita guest spending growth rate is stated on a constant currency basis.

The decrease in operating labor was due to furloughs in response to lower volumes and the benefit of government credits for certain employee costs, partially offset by inflation and new guest offerings. Lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs were due to lower volumes. The decrease in infrastructure costs was due to lower operations support costs reflecting reduced volumes, partially offset by the write-down of assets at our retail stores and higher costs for new guest offerings. Other operating expenses, which include costs for such items as supplies, commissions/fees and entertainment offerings, decreased $463 million, from $2,454 million to $1,991 million, due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher charges for capital project abandonments.Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $491 million from $3,133 million to $2,642 million due to marketing and general and administrative cost reduction initiatives to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.Depreciation and amortization increased $131 million from $2,306 million to $2,437 million, primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income decreased $6,839 million, to a loss of $81 million due to decreases at our domestic and international parks and experiences and, to a lesser extent, our retail and merchandise licensing businesses.44TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment:Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3,2020September 28,2019Supplemental revenue detailParks & ExperiencesDomestic$10,226 $17,369 (41) %International2,020 4,223 (52) %Consumer Products4,256 4,633 (8) %$16,502 $26,225 (37) %Supplemental operating income detailParks & ExperiencesDomestic$(623) $4,412 nmInternational(1,073) 507 nmConsumer Products1,615 1,839 (12) %$(81) $6,758 nmItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Parks, Experiences and ProductsThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Parks, Experiences and Products segment that are excluded from segment operating income:Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3,2020September 28,2019Restructuring and impairment charges$(265) $(13) >(100) %Amortization of TFCF intangible assets(8) (4) (100) %Studio EntertainmentOperating results for the Studio Entertainment segment are as follows: Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3, 2020September 28, 2019RevenuesTheatrical distribution$2,134 $4,726 (55) %Home entertainment1,528 1,734 (12) %TV/SVOD distribution and other5,974 4,667 28 %Total revenues9,636 11,127 (13) %Operating expenses(4,619) (5,187) 11 %Selling, general, administrative and other(2,369) (3,119) 24 %Depreciation and amortization(146) (135) (8) %Equity in the loss of investees(1) — nmOperating Income$2,501 $2,686 (7) %RevenuesThe decrease in theatrical distribution revenue was due to fewer significant releases, which included the impact of theater closures as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. Significant titles in the current year included Frozen II, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil. Significant titles in the prior year included Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Captain Marvel, Toy Story 4, Aladdin, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo.45TABLE OF CONTENTSLower home entertainment revenue was due to decreases of 21% from lower unit sales of both new releases and catalog titles and 4% from lower average net effective pricing, partially offset by an increase of 14% from the consolidation of TFCF. New release titles in the current year included Frozen II, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, The Lion King and Toy Story 4, whereas the prior year included Avengers: Endgame, Incredibles 2, Captain Marvel, Ant-Man And The Wasp, Ralph Breaks The Internet, Avengers: Infinity War, Bohemian Rhapsody and Aladdin. The decrease in average net effective pricing was primarily due to a lower mix of new release titles.Higher TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to increases of 21% from TV/SVOD distribution and 14% from the consolidation of TFCF, partially offset by a decrease of 8% from stage plays reflecting the impact of theater closures in response to COVID-19. The increase in TV/SVOD distribution was due to sales of content to Disney+, partially offset by lower sales to third parties in the pay and free television windows.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses include amortization of production, participation and residual costs, which decreased $119 million, from $3,762 million to $3,643 million, primarily due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment revenue, partially offset by higher TV/SVOD distribution revenue and the consolidation of TFCF. Operating expenses also include cost of goods sold and distribution costs, which decreased $449 million, from $1,425 million to $976 million. Lower cost of goods sold and distribution costs were primarily due to decreases in theatrical and stage play distribution costs due to fewer theatrical releases and stage play performances, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF.Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $750 million from $3,119 million to $2,369 million due to lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing costs, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF.The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the consolidation of TFCF.Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income decreased 7%, or $185 million to $2,501 million due to lower theatrical and stage play results, partially offset by an increase in TV/SVOD distribution results.Items Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Studio EntertainmentThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Studio Entertainment segment that are excluded from segment operating income:Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3,2020September 28,2019Amortization of TFCF intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs(1)$(291) $(206) (41) %Restructuring and impairment charges(114) (219) 48 %(1)In the current year, amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $184 million and amortization of intangible assets was $107 million.

Higher addressable advertising sales were due to the consolidation of Hulu and, to a lesser extent, TFCF and higher impressions, partially offset by lower rates. The increase in impressions was due to growth at Hulu, partially offset by the timing of cricket programming and the impact of lower impressions at our other digital platforms. The decrease in rates was primarily due to lower rates at Hulu. The decrease in advertising revenues at our International Channels was driven by lower impressions, partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF. The decrease in impressions reflected the impact of COVID-19, including a shift in the timing of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches to fiscal 2021, and the comparison to the prior-year broadcast of International Cricket Council World Cup (ICC WC) matches. The ICC WC is held every four years. Growth in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to higher Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view fees, the consolidation of TFCF and, to a lesser extent, Hulu and Disney+ Premier Access revenues from Mulan. These increases were partially offset by the comparison to the sub-licensing of ICC WC rights to third-party broadcasters in the prior year and lower revenue from streaming technology services.The following table presents the number of paid subscribers(1) (in millions) for Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu as of: % ChangeOctober 3,2020September 28,2019Better(Worse)Disney+(3)73.7 — nmESPN+10.3 3.5 >100 %HuluSVOD Only32.5 25.6 27 %Live TV + SVOD4.1 2.9 41 %Total Hulu 36.6 28.5 28 %47TABLE OF CONTENTSThe following table presents the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber(2) for the fiscal year ended: % ChangeOctober 3,2020September 28,2019Better(Worse)Disney+(3) (4)$4.80$—nmESPN+(5)$4.35$5.12(15) %Hulu(6)SVOD Only$12.24$13.09(6) %Live TV + SVOD$67.24$55.9820 %(1)A subscriber for which we recognized subscription revenue. A subscriber ceases to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. A subscription bundle is considered a paid subscriber for each service included in the bundle. Subscribers include those who receive the service through wholesale arrangements in which we receive a fee for the distribution of Disney+ to each subscriber to an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC services, whether acquired individually, through a wholesale arrangement or via the bundle, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.(2)Revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based upon the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period beginning at launch and ending on the last day of the period. The average revenue per subscriber is net of discounts provided to both wholesale and bundled subscribers, annual subscriptions and other limited term promotional offers. The bundled discount is allocated to each service based on the relative retail price of each service on a standalone basis. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third party platforms like Apple.(3)Disney+ Hotstar launched on April 3, 2020 in India (as a conversion of the preexisting Hotstar service) and on September 5, 2020 in Indonesia, and is included in the number of paid subscribers and average monthly revenue per paid subscriber.

Includes advertising revenue (including amounts generated during free trial subscription periods).The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for ESPN+ decreased from $5.12 to $4.35 due to the introduction of a bundled subscription package offering of Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu beginning in November 2019 and lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, partially offset by an increase in retail pricing in August 2020. The bundled offering has a lower retail price than the aggregate standalone retail prices of the individual services.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu SVOD Only service decreased from $13.09 to $12.24 driven by a decrease in retail pricing, lower per-subscriber advertising revenue and the introduction of the bundled offering, partially offset by a lower mix of promotional and wholesale subscribers. The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu Live TV + SVOD service increased from $55.98 to $67.24 due to an increase in retail pricing in December 2019 and higher per-subscriber Live TV advertising and premium add-on revenue, partially offset by the introduction of the bundled offering.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses include a $5,381 million increase in programming and production costs, from $6,925 million to $12,306 million, and a $1,151 million increase in other operating expenses, from $1,615 million to $2,766 million. Programming and production costs include the costs of content provided by other segments. The increase in programming and production costs was due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF, the launch of Disney+ and higher costs at Hulu, partially offset by lower costs for sports programming. The increase in costs at Hulu was driven by higher subscriber-based fees for programming on the Live TV service. Lower costs for sports programming were primarily due to the comparison to the ICC WC in the prior year and the shift in the timing of IPL, partially offset by higher costs for UFC programming rights. Other operating expenses, which include technical support and distribution costs, increased due to the launch of Disney+ and the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF.48TABLE OF CONTENTSSelling, general, administrative and other costs increased $2,085 million, from $2,116 million to $4,201 million, due to the launch of Disney+ and the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF.Depreciation and amortization increased $135 million, from $325 million to $460 million, due to the consolidation of Hulu and TFCF and the launch of Disney+.Equity in the Loss of InvesteesLoss from equity investees in the prior year of $240 million improved by $200 million to a loss of $40 million, due to the consolidation of Hulu. In the current year, Hulu’s results are reported in revenues and expenses. In the prior year, prior to March 20, 2019, the Company recognized its ownership share of Hulu’s results in equity in the loss of investees.Segment Operating LossSegment operating loss increased from $1,835 million to $2,806 million, due to costs associated with the launch of Disney+, the consolidation of Hulu and a decrease at our International Channels. These decreases were partially offset by the consolidation of TFCF and improved results at ESPN+ and Hulu.The following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income (loss) detail for the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment: Year Ended% Change(in millions)October 3,2020September 28,2019Better(Worse)Supplemental revenue detailDirect-to-Consumer services$10,444 $3,347 >100 %International Channels5,413 4,727 15 %Other(1)1,110 1,312 (15) %$16,967 $9,386 81 %Supplemental operating income (loss) detailDirect-to-Consumer services(3,294) (1,849) (78) %International Channels872 649 34 %Other(1)(344) (395) 13 %Equity in the loss of investees(40) (240) 83 %$(2,806) $(1,835) (53) %(1)Primarily addressable ad sales related to domestic Media Networks branded properties (addressable ad sales related to our Direct-to-Consumer services, principally Hulu, are reflected in “Direct-to-Consumer services”)Items Excluded from Segment Operating Loss Related to Direct-to-Consumer & InternationalThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment that are excluded from segment operating loss:Year Ended% ChangeBetter(Worse)(in millions)October 3,2020September 28,2019Amortization of TFCF and Hulu intangible assets and fair value step-up on film and television costs(1)$(1,242) $(701) (77) %Hulu Gain— 4,822 (100) %Restructuring and impairment charges(2)(5,229) (456) >(100) %Impairment of equity investments— (354) 100 %(1)In the current year, amortization of intangible assets was $1,196 million, amortization of intangible assets related to TFCF equity investees was $26 million and amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $20 million.

The increase in Media Networks sales to Hulu was due to higher sales of original titles, driven by Little Fires Everywhere and Mrs. America, and library titles. Higher Media Networks sales also included an increase in affiliate fees received from Hulu for networks in the Hulu Live TV + SVOD service. Media Networks sales to Disney+ were due to sales of library series, including The Simpsons and Disney Channel titles, and original series. Studio Entertainment content sold to Disney+ included original titles Noelle, Lady and the Tramp, and Artemis Fowl and theatrically released titles Frozen II, The Lion King, Toy Story 4 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

These increases were partially offset by lower operating cash flow at Parks, Experiences and Products and Direct-to-Consumer & International. The increase at Media Networks was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by an increase in revenue. Lower operating cash flows at Parks, Experiences and Products were due to lower cash receipts driven by decreased revenues, partially offset by lower cash disbursements. Lower cash disbursements were due to lower operating expenses. The decrease at Direct-to-Consumer & International was due to higher film and television spending and an increase in operating cash disbursements due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts driven by revenues from the consolidation of TFCF and Hulu and the launch of Disney+.Depreciation expense is as follows:(in millions)20202019Media NetworksCable Networks$120$107Broadcasting8384Total Media Networks203191Parks, Experiences and ProductsDomestic1,6341,474International694724Total Parks, Experiences and Products2,3282,198Studio Entertainment8774Direct-to-Consumer & International348214Corporate174167Total depreciation expense$3,140$2,844Amortization of intangible assets is as follows:(in millions)20202019Media Networks$4$—Parks, Experiences and Products109108Studio Entertainment5961Direct-to-Consumer & International112111TFCF and Hulu1,9211,043Total amortization of intangible assets$2,205$1,32351TABLE OF CONTENTSProduced and licensed content costsThe Company’s Studio Entertainment, Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer & International segments incur costs to license and produce film and television programming. Film and television production costs include all internally produced content such as live-action and animated films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays or other similar product. Programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the Company’s broadcast and cable networks, television stations and DTC services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. Accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.The Company’s film and television production and programming activity for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows:(in millions)20202019Beginning balances:Production and programming assets$27,407 $9,202 Programming liabilities(4,061) (1,178) 23,346 8,024 Spending:Television program licenses and rights12,077 10,517 Film and television production8,104 7,104 20,181 17,621 Amortization:Television program licenses and rights(11,241) (10,608) Film and television production(9,337) (6,471) (20,578) (17,079) Change in film and television production andprogramming costs(397) 542 Film and television production costs from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu, net of programming liabilities assumed— 14,769 Other non-cash activity145 11 Ending balances:Production and programming assets27,193 27,407 Programming liabilities(4,099) (4,061) $23,094 $23,346 Discontinued operationsCash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflected the operations of the RSNs.52TABLE OF CONTENTSInvesting ActivitiesContinuing operationsInvesting activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are as follows:(in millions)20202019Media NetworksCable Networks$61 $93 Broadcasting51 81 Parks, Experiences and ProductsDomestic2,145 3,294 International759 852 Studio Entertainment77 88 Direct-to-Consumer & International594 258 Corporate335 210 $4,022 $4,876 Capital expenditures at Media Networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.Capital expenditures for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The decrease in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower spend on Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at both the Walt Disney World and Disneyland resorts. Capital spending in fiscal 2020 also reflected the suspension of certain capital projects as a result of COVID-19.Capital expenditures at Direct-to-Consumer & International primarily reflect investments in technology. The increase in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to spending on technology to support our streaming services.Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increase in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was due to higher spending on facilities.The Company currently expects its fiscal 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $0.6 billion higher than fiscal 2020 capital expenditures of $4.0 billion due to increased spending on facilities at Corporate and spending on technology at Direct-to-Consumer & International, partially offset by lower investments at our domestic parks and resorts, in part reflecting a reduction in spending in response to COVID-19.Other Investing ActivitiesThe fiscal 2019 spending of $9.9 billion on acquisitions reflects $35.7 billion of cash paid to acquire TFCF less $25.7 billion of cash acquired in the transaction (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Cash provided by other investing activities of $172 million in fiscal 2020 reflects the proceeds from the sale of an investment while cash used in other investing activities of $319 million in fiscal 2019 reflects contributions of $347 million to Hulu prior to the consolidation of Hulu.Discontinued operationsCash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 reflects the sale of the RSNs.Financing ActivitiesContinuing operationsCash provided by financing activities was $8.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to cash used in financing activities of $0.5 billion in fiscal 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to borrowings, partially offset by dividend payments and settlement of acquisition related obligations. The increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was from higher cash proceeds from net borrowings ($11.2 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019).53TABLE OF CONTENTSDiscontinued operationsCash used in financing activities by discontinued operations in fiscal 2019 was due to redemption of noncontrolling interests of the RSNs.Borrowings activities and otherDuring the year ended October 3, 2020, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:(in millions)September 28, 2019BorrowingsPaymentsOtherActivityOctober 3, 2020Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months(1)$1,934 $— $(1,961) $27 $— Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months3,408 11,500 (12,893) 8 2,023 U.S. dollar denominated notes(2)39,424 16,968 (3,405) (251) 52,736 Asia Theme Parks borrowings1,114 175 (88) 102 1,303 Foreign currency denominated debt and other(3)1,106 977 (40) 523 2,566 $46,986 $29,620 $(18,387) $409 $58,628 (1)Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.(2)The other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase price adjustments on debt assumed in the TFCF acquisition and debt issuance fees.(3)The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s bank facilities. The Company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities maturing in March 2021, March 2023 and March 2025, unused availability under the $5.0 billion bank facility maturing in April 2021, incremental term debt issuances and operating cash flows, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in fiscal 2020 or 2019.The Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control, including COVID-19, which has affected our segment operations in a number of ways, and as a result, had an adverse impact on the Company’s operating cash flows. We have taken a number of measures to mitigate the impact on the Company’s financial position. We have significantly increased the Company’s cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020. In addition, we entered into an additional $5.0 billion credit facility in April 2020, bringing the total capacity of our bank facilities to $17.25 billion. See Significant Developments for the impact COVID-19 had on our operations and mitigating measures.Despite the impact of COVID-19, we believe that the Company’s financial condition remains strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects, although certain of these activities have been scaled back or suspended in light of COVID-19. In addition to measures the Company has already taken in response to COVID-19, there are a number of additional mitigating actions the Company may take in the future such as not declaring dividends (which the Board of Directors did not declare with respect to fiscal 2020 operations); reducing, or not making certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; raising additional financing; further suspending capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force.The Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of October 3, 2020, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1, respectively, Standard and Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2, respectively, and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2, respectively. In addition, Fitch has placed the Company’s long-term debt rating on Negative Outlook. On November 18, 2020, Standard and Poor’s lowered the Company’s long-term rating to BBB+ and placed the Company’s long-term ratings on Negative Outlook. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 3, 2020, by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.54TABLE OF CONTENTSThe duration of business closures and other impacts related to COVID-19, and the corresponding duration of the impacts to our operating cash flows, are subject to substantial uncertainty. These impacts to our operating cash flows may require us to rely more heavily on external funding sources, such as debt and other types of financing.SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONOn March 20, 2019, as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (“TWDC”) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at October 3, 2020 was as follows:TWDCLegacy Disney(in millions)Par ValueCarrying ValuePar ValueCarrying ValueRegistered debt with unconditional guarantee$38,646 $41,077 $12,541 $12,751 The guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.Operations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.Set forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Results of operations (in millions)Fiscal Year Ended October 3, 2020Revenues$— Costs and expenses— Net income (loss) from continuing operations(1,158) Net income (loss)(1,158) Net income (loss) attributable to TWDC shareholders(1,158) 55TABLE OF CONTENTSBalance Sheet (in millions)October 3, 2020September 28, 2019Current assets$12,899 $1,145 Noncurrent assets2,076 1,398 Current liabilities6,155 9,405 Noncurrent liabilities (excluding intercompany to non-Guarantors)57,809 41,728 Intercompany payables to non-Guarantors146,748 143,574 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSThe Company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.

For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsAt the beginning of fiscal 2020, the Company adopted on a prospective basis, new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance that updates the accounting for film and television content costs. Under that new guidance, we amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows, including intersegment content transactions, and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value). If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We reduced our discount rate to 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 from 3.22% at the end of fiscal 2019 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2020 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2021 by approximately $351 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 3, 2020 by approximately $4.0 billion. A one 57TABLE OF CONTENTSpercentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $303 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2021 annual expense by approximately $164 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2020, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The projected cash flows of our reporting units reflect intersegment revenues and expenses for the sale and use of intellectual property. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires consideration of recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.58TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherit in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $5.2 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangibles assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business as discussed below under “Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and Estimates.”The fiscal 2019 charges primarily related to impairments of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting recorded in “Equity in the income (loss) of investees” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. In times of domestic or global economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies. As COVID-19 continues to develop, we may make changes to these estimates and judgments over time, which could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods. A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsCertain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed or canceled. The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g. bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs.Given the ongoing uncertainty around the resumption and continuation of live sporting events, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events. Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.59TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenue RecognitionCertain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g. live sports or original content). If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsGiven the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal. If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets.Our International Channels reporting unit, which is part of the Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, comprises the Company’s international television networks. Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks. A majority of the operations in this reporting unit were acquired in the TFCF acquisition and therefore the fair value of these businesses approximated the carrying value at the date of the acquisition of TFCF.The International Channels business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in decreased viewership and lower advertising revenue related to the availability of content, including the deferral or cancellation of certain live sporting events. The Company’s increased focus on DTC distribution in international markets is expected to negatively impact the International Channels business as we shift the primary means of monetizing our film and television content from licensing of linear channels to use on our DTC services because the International Channels reporting unit valuation does not include the value derived from this shift, which is reflected in other reporting units. In addition, the industry shift to DTC, including by us and many of our distributors, who are pursuing their own DTC strategies, has changed the competitive dynamics for the International Channels business and resulted in unfavorable affiliation renewal terms for certain of our distribution agreements.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels’ long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Risk Management ContractsThe Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.Changes to our hedged cash flows from a decrease in projected revenues of the Company or reductions of projected usage of commodities as compared to our projections when we entered into hedges may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in our income statement prior to when the hedged transaction was projected to occur.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our shareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations, projections, estimates or future impacts; actions that we may take (or not take); or developments beyond our control, including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. Significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business.60TABLE OF CONTENTSITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.VAR on a combined basis increased to $323 million at October 3, 2020 from $322 million at September 28, 2019.61TABLE OF CONTENTSThe estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):Fiscal 2020Interest RateSensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCurrencySensitiveFinancialInstrumentsEquity SensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCommodity Sensitive Financial InstrumentsCombinedPortfolioYear end fiscal 2020 VAR$304$29$81$1$323Average VAR43937323448Highest VAR71857815742Lowest VAR2211911223Year end fiscal 2019 VAR 3172812322The VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of October 3, 2020 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table.",2023-12-30 17:48:24.082914

It includes the following sections:•Significant Developments•Consolidated Results and Non-Segment Items•Business Segment Results •Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses•Restructuring Activities•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Forward-Looking StatementsIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2021 and 2020 results and comparisons of fiscal 2021 results to fiscal 2020 results. Discussions of fiscal 2019 results and comparisons of fiscal 2020 results to fiscal 2019 results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the update to Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2020 as reported in Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on form 8-K of the Company filed April 1, 2021.SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTSCOVID-19 PandemicSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at the DPEP segment where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. These operations resumed, generally at reduced capacity, at various points since May 2020. We have delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases, and stage play performances were suspended as of March 2020. Stage play operations resumed, generally at reduced capacity, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Theaters have been subject to capacity limitations and shifting government mandates or guidance regarding COVID-19 restrictions. We experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the delay of key live sports programming during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, as well as the suspension of most film and television production in March 2020. Although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we continue to see disruption of production activities depending on local circumstances. Fewer theatrical releases and production delays have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release.We have taken a number of mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses. We significantly increased cash balances through the issuance of senior notes in March and May 2020. The Company did not pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations and has not declared or paid a dividend with respect to fiscal 2021 operations; suspended certain capital projects; reduced certain discretionary expenditures (such as spending on marketing); reduced management compensation for several months in fiscal 2020 and temporarily eliminated Board of Director retainers and committee fees in fiscal 2020. In addition, we furloughed over 120,000 of our employees (who continued to receive Company provided medical benefits), most of which have returned from furlough as operations have reopened. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company announced a workforce reduction plan, which was essentially completed in the first half of fiscal 2021. We may take additional mitigation actions in the future such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; reducing, or not making, certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; further suspending capital spending, reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force; or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our businesses.The most significant impact on operating income since the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from COVID-19 was at the DPEP segment due to revenue lost as a result of closures and/or reduced operating capacities. Although results improved in the second half of fiscal 2021 compared to the second half of fiscal 2020 from reopening our DPEP businesses, we continue to be impacted by reduced operating capacities. COVID-19 also had a negative impact in fiscal 2021 at our DMED segment compared to fiscal 2020 as higher advertising revenue from the return of live sporting events was more than offset by higher sports programming costs. Our other film and television distribution businesses were impacted by revenue lost from the deferral or cancellation of significant film releases, partially offset by costs avoided due to a reduction in film cost amortization, marketing and distribution costs. The impact of COVID-19 on fiscal 2021 and 2020 results is not necessarily indicative of the impact on future period results.32TABLE OF CONTENTSThe impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.Our businesses have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent. For example, when we reopened theme parks and retail stores, we incurred and will continue to incur costs for such things as additional custodial services, personal protection equipment, temperature screenings and testing, sanitizer and cleaning supplies and signage, among other items. Similar costs have been incurred in the production of film and television content, including live sporting events, and productions may take longer to complete. The timing, duration and extent of these costs will depend on the timing and scope of the resumption of our operations. These costs totaled approximately $1 billion in fiscal 2021. Some of these costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over future periods. With the unknown duration of COVID-19, it is not possible to precisely estimate the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in future periods, although we estimate a modestly lower impact in fiscal 2022. In addition, we are no longer benefiting from certain savings related to the closure of certain businesses, such as related furloughs. The reopening or closure of our businesses is dependent on applicable government requirements, which vary by location and are subject to ongoing changes.Additionally, see Part I., Item 1A. Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.Direct-to-ConsumerThe Company has significantly increased its focus on distribution of branded film and episodic content via our own DTC streaming services. As a result, we are forgoing certain licensing revenue from the sale of this content to third parties in TV/SVOD markets. We also expect to forgo revenue as we shut down channels in certain markets as a result of investment in our DTC offerings. In addition, we are increasing programming and production investments to create exclusive content for our DTC offerings.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMSThe Company’s fiscal year end is on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. Fiscal 2020 was a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020. We estimate that the additional week of operations in fiscal 2020 resulted in a benefit to pre-tax income in the prior year of approximately $200 million, primarily at the DMED segment.Revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 3%, or $2.0 billion, to $67.4 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $4.9 billion, to income of $2.0 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to income of $1.11 compared to a loss of $1.57 in the prior year. The EPS increase for the year was due to the comparison to goodwill and intangible asset impairments recognized in the prior year at our International Channels business, an income tax benefit in the current year compared to tax expense in the prior year and lower amortization of fair value step-up on film and television costs and intangible assets from the TFCF acquisition and consolidation of Hulu (collectively TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization). These increases were partially offset by lower net investment gains and a decrease in segment operating income at DMED.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 4%, or $2.5 billion, to $61.8 billion, due to higher DTC subscription revenue, advertising revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, increased merchandise licensing revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in TV/SVOD distribution revenue, lower theatrical revenues, a decrease in revenue at our parks and experiences businesses and, to a lesser extent, lower electronic home entertainment sales, all of which reflected the impact of COVID-19. The decrease at parks and experiences was due to lower volumes from closure/generally reduced operating capacities, partially offset by an increase in average guest spending. The decrease in TV/SVOD distribution revenue also reflected the shift from licensing our content to third parties to distributing it on our DTC streaming services.Product revenues for fiscal 2021 decreased 8%, or $0.5 billion, to $5.7 billion, due to lower home entertainment volumes and a decrease in merchandise, food and beverage sales at parks and experiences as lower volumes were partially offset by an increase in average guest spending.Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2021 increased 4%, or $1.7 billion, to $41.1 billion, due to higher programming, production and technology costs at Disney+ and Hulu and higher sports programming costs. The increase in sports programming costs was due to NBA, cricket, college football and soccer events, many of which shifted from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in film and television production cost amortization and distribution costs at 33TABLE OF CONTENTSContent Sales/Licensing reflecting lower revenues and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes at our parks and experiences businesses.Cost of products for fiscal 2021 decreased 11%, or $0.5 billion, to $4.0 billion, due to lower merchandise, food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts and a decrease in home entertainment volumes.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2021 increased 9%, or $1.1 billion, to $13.5 billion, due to higher marketing costs at Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks, partially offset by lower marketing costs at Content Sales/Licensing.Depreciation and amortization costs decreased 4%, or $0.2 billion, to $5.1 billion due to lower amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of TFCF and Hulu and lower depreciation at our theme parks and resorts.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were $0.7 billion due to $0.4 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shut-down of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe and $0.3 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of TFCF and workforce reductions at DPEP. Restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2020 were $5.7 billion due to $5.0 billion of impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets at our International Channels business and $0.8 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the acquisition and integration of TFCF and at our DPEP segment.Other Income (expense), net(in millions)20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)fuboTV gain$186 $— nmGerman FTA gain126 — nmDraftKings gain (loss)(111) 973 nmEndemol Shine gain— 65 — %Other income, net$201 $1,038 (81) %In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a $186 million gain from the sale of our investment in fuboTV Inc.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.Our DMED segment primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across three content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment and Sports. Programming and production costs include amortization of acquired licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs (including participations and residuals) and production costs related to live programming such as news and sports.The Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technical support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.The Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also includes fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear networks feed and other services.The Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.Our DPEP segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include information systems expense, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income.

The decrease in impressions reflected lower average viewership, partially offset by higher units delivered. The decrease in Broadcasting advertising revenue was primarily due to decreases of 7% from fewer impressions at ABC and 2% from the comparison to the additional week of operations in the prior year, partially offset by increases of 4% from higher rates at ABC and 4% from the owned television stations. The decrease in impressions reflected lower average viewership, partially offset by higher units delivered. The increase at the owned television stations was primarily due to higher rates reflecting political advertising. The increase in International Channels advertising revenue was due to increases of 43% from higher impressions, reflecting an increase in average viewership, 6% from higher rates and 2% from a favorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by a decrease of 5% from the comparison to the additional week of operations in the prior year. The increase in impressions was due to the airing of live sporting events in the current year that were not aired in the prior year, primarily Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches.Other revenue decreased $52 million, to $588 million from $640 million, due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.

As a result of COVID-19, events have been delayed since March 2020. The most significant impacts were due to the shift of NBA and college football games from fiscal 2020 into the current fiscal year. The increase in programming and production costs at Broadcasting was due to an increase in the average cost of programming reflecting incremental costs of health and safety measures. The increase in programming and production costs at the International Channels was due to an increase in sports programming costs, partially offset by the comparison to the additional week of operations in the prior year and the impact of channel closures. Higher sports programming costs were due to the timing of live sporting events driven by the shift of IPL cricket matches into the current year from fiscal 2020.Selling, general administrative and other costs increased $161 million, to $3,491 million from $3,330 million, due to higher marketing costs at FX Channels and ABC reflecting more titles premiering in the current year, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.Depreciation and amortization decreased $94 million, to $168 million from $262 million, primarily due to the transfer of technology assets and related depreciation primarily between Linear Networks and Content Sales/Licensing and Other and higher asset write-offs in the prior year. Equity in the Income of InvesteesIncome from equity investees increased $50 million, to $781 million from $731 million, primarily due to higher income from A+E Television Networks driven by an increase in program sales and lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue and higher marketing costs.Operating Income from Linear NetworksOperating income decreased 11%, to $8,407 million from $9,413 million due to decreases at Cable and, to a lesser extent, Broadcasting, partially offset by an increase at the International Channels and higher income from equity investees.

Higher impressions were due to increases at Hulu, Disney+ and, to a lesser extent, ESPN+.The increase in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to higher Disney+ Premier Access revenues and an increase in Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view fees. Higher Disney+ Premier Access revenues were due to four releases in the current year, Black Widow, Raya, Jungle Cruise and Cruella, compared to one release in the prior year, Mulan. The increase in UFC pay-per-view fees reflected the benefit of thirteen events in the current year compared to eleven in the prior year and higher pricing.The following table presents the number of paid subscribers(1) (in millions) for Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu as of:October 2, 2021October 3, 2020% ChangeBetter (Worse)Disney+(2)118.1 73.7 60 %ESPN+17.1 10.3 66 %HuluSVOD Only39.7 32.5 22 %Live TV + SVOD4.0 4.1 (2) %Total Hulu(3) 43.8 36.6 20 %The following table presents the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber(4) for the fiscal year ended:20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)Disney+$4.08$4.80(15) %ESPN+$4.57$4.355 %HuluSVOD Only$12.86$12.245 %Live TV + SVOD$81.35$67.2421 %(1)Reflects subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to the bundled offering in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each service included in the bundle (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+). Star+ in Latin America is offered as a standalone service or along with Disney+. If a subscriber has either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or both the Disney+ and Star+ services, they are counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, whether acquired individually, through a wholesale arrangement or via the bundle, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.(2)Includes Disney+ Hotstar and Star+. Disney+ Hotstar launched on April 3, 2020 in India (as a conversion of the preexisting Hotstar service), on September 5, 2020 in Indonesia, on June 1, 2021 in Malaysia, and on June 30, 2021 in Thailand. Disney+ Hotstar average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is significantly lower than the average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ in other markets. Star+ launched in Latin America on August 31, 2021. (3)Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.(4)Revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses) and premium and feature add-on revenue but excludes Premier Access and Pay-Per-View revenue. The average revenue per subscriber is net of discounts on bundled services. The bundled discount is allocated to each service based on the relative retail price of each service on a standalone basis. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third party platforms like Apple.40TABLE OF CONTENTSThe average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ decreased from $4.80 to $4.08 due to a higher mix of Disney+ Hotstar subscribers in the current year, partially offset by a lower mix of wholesale subscribers in the current year and increases in retail pricing.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for ESPN+ increased from $4.35 to $4.57 primarily due to increases in retail pricing in August 2021 and August 2020, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to the bundled offering.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu SVOD Only service increased from $12.24 to $12.86 primarily due to higher per-subscriber advertising revenue, a lower mix of wholesale subscribers and an increase in per-subscriber premium add-on revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to the bundled offering. The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu Live TV + SVOD service increased from $67.24 to $81.35 due to an increase in retail pricing in December 2020, higher per-subscriber advertising revenue and, to a lesser extent, per-subscriber premium and feature add-on revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to the bundled offering.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:(in millions)20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)Programming and production costs$(10,716) $(8,124) (32) %Other operating expense(2,518) (1,954) (29) %$(13,234) $(10,078) (31) %The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher costs at Disney+, Hulu and, to a lesser extent, ESPN+. The increase at Disney+ was due to the ongoing expansion including launches in additional markets. Higher costs at Hulu were due to an increase in subscriber-based fees for programming the Live service driven by higher average monthly subscribers and rate increases. Higher ESPN+ costs were primarily due to new soccer programming rights, higher costs for UFC programming rights driven by two additional events in the current year, and new college sports rights. Other operating expenses, which include technical support and distribution costs, increased due to higher distribution costs at Disney+ due to the ongoing expansion.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $1,309 million, to $4,435 million from $3,126 million, due to higher marketing and general and administrative costs at Disney+ driven by the ongoing expansion.Depreciation and amortization increased $69 million, to $329 million from $260 million, driven by the ongoing expansion of Disney+.Operating Loss from Direct-to-ConsumerOperating loss from Direct-to-Consumer decreased $1,234 million, to $1,679 million from $2,913 million due to improved results at Hulu and, to a lesser extent, ESPN+, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+.Content Sales/Licensing and OtherOperating results for Content Sales/Licensing and Other are as follows:(in millions)20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)RevenuesTV/SVOD distribution$4,206 $5,673 (26) %Theatrical distribution920 2,134 (57) %Home entertainment1,014 1,802 (44) %Other1,206 1,368 (12) %Total revenues7,346 10,977 (33) %Operating expenses(4,536) (6,871) 34 %Selling, general, administrative and other(1,963) (2,628) 25 %Depreciation and amortization(294) (291) (1) %Equity in the income (loss) of investees14 (34) nmOperating Income$567 $1,153 (51) %41TABLE OF CONTENTSCOVID-19Our Content Sales/Licensing businesses have been impacted by COVID-19 in a number of ways. We have delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled, theatrical releases, and stage play performances were suspended as of March 2020. Stage play operations resumed, generally at reduced capacity, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Theaters have been subject to capacity limitations and shifting government mandates or guidance regarding COVID-19. We experienced significant disruptions in the production and availability of content, including the suspension of most film and television production in March 2020. Although film and television production generally resumed beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, we continue to see disruption of production activities depending on local circumstances. Fewer theatrical releases and production delays have limited the availability of film content to be sold in distribution windows subsequent to the theatrical release.RevenuesThe decrease in TV/SVOD distribution revenue reflected both lower episodic and film content sales. The decrease in episodic content sales was primarily due to lower sales of Homeland, How to Get Away with Murder, Modern Family, Grey’s Anatomy and This is Us in the current year and the comparison to prior-year sales of Ratched, The Politician, Tales from the Loop and The Wilds. Lower film content sales reflected less content available due to the impact of COVID-19 and the shift from licensing our content to third parties to distributing it on our DTC streaming services.The decrease in theatrical distribution revenue was due to the prior-year performance of Frozen II and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which were both released prior to COVID-19’s impact on our business. Other significant titles released in the prior year included Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and Ford v Ferrari, whereas the current year included Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Black Widow and Free Guy.The decrease in home entertainment revenue was due to decreases of 36% from lower unit sales and 5% from lower average net effective pricing. New release titles in the current year included Mulan, Raya and the Last Dragon and Black Widow, whereas the prior year included Frozen II, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, Onward, Ford v Ferrari, Aladdin and Avengers: Endgame. The decrease in average net effective pricing was due to a lower mix of new release titles, which have a higher sales price than catalog titles.The decrease in other revenue was due to lower revenue from stage plays reflecting the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in revenue from Lucasfilm’s special effects business driven by more projects.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:(in millions)20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)Programming and production costs$(3,611)$(5,729)37 %Distribution costs and cost of goods sold (925)(1,142)19 %$(4,536)$(6,871)34 %The decrease in programming and production costs was due to lower production cost amortization driven by a decline in revenues and lower film and television cost impairments.The decrease in distribution costs and cost of goods sold was primarily due to lower home entertainment volumes, a decrease in costs for stage plays as a result of a limited number of performances in the current year and lower theatrical distribution costs due to fewer theatrical releases, partially offset by more projects at Lucasfilm’s special effects business.Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $665 million, to $1,963 million from $2,628 million, primarily due to lower theatrical and home entertainment marketing costs and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in bad debt expense.Equity in the Income (Loss) of InvesteesIncome from equity investments increased $48 million, to income of $14 million from a loss of $34 million, primarily due to higher income from Tata Sky Limited and the absence of an investment impairment recognized in the prior year.Operating Income from Content Sales/Licensing and OtherOperating income from Content Sales/Licensing and Other decreased $586 million, to $567 million from $1,153 million, primarily due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment results, partially offset by lower film and television cost impairments.42TABLE OF CONTENTSItems Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Disney Media and Entertainment DistributionThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the DMED segment that are excluded from segment operating income:(in millions)20212020% Change Better (Worse)TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization(1)$(2,410) $(2,838)15 %Restructuring and impairment charges(2)(315) (5,394) 94 %German FTA gain126 — nm(1)In the current year, amortization of step-up on film and television costs was $646 million and amortization of intangible assets was $1,749 million.

The decrease in infrastructure costs was primarily due to the prior year write-down of assets at our retail stores and reduced volumes. Lower cost of goods sold were due to lower 44TABLE OF CONTENTSvolumes. The decrease in other operating expenses was due to lower volumes and the comparison to prior-year charges for capital project abandonments. Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $244 million from $2,642 million to $2,886 million due to higher incentive compensation costs and increased marketing spend.Depreciation and amortization decreased $60 million from $2,437 million to $2,377 million, primarily due to lower depreciation at our theme parks and resorts. Segment Operating IncomeSegment operating income increased $16 million, to $471 million due to an increase at our consumer products business, largely offset by a decrease at our domestic parks and experiences.The following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income detail for the Parks, Experiences and Products segment:(in millions)20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)Supplemental revenue detailParks & ExperiencesDomestic$9,353 $10,226 (9) %International1,859 2,020 (8) %Consumer Products5,340 4,792 11 %$16,552 $17,038 (3) %Supplemental operating income detailParks & ExperiencesDomestic$(1,139) $(623) (83) %International(1,074) (1,073) — %Consumer Products2,684 2,151 25 %$471 $455 4 %Items Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Parks, Experiences and ProductsThe following table presents supplemental information for items related to the DPEP segment that are excluded from segment operating income:(in millions)20212020% ChangeBetter (Worse)Restructuring and impairment charges(1)$(327) $(265) (23) %Amortization of TFCF intangible assets(8) (8) — %(1)The current year includes asset impairments and severance costs related to the closure of a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe and severance costs related to other workforce reductions.

The decrease at DMED was due to higher spending on film and television productions. The increase at DPEP was due to lower operating cash disbursements due to the pay-down of liabilities in the prior year as a result of closures/reduced capacities and lower volumes in the current year.Depreciation expense is as follows:(in millions)20212020Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution$613$638Disney Parks, Experiences and ProductsDomestic1,5511,634International718694Total Disney Parks, Experiences and Products2,2692,328Corporate186174Total depreciation expense$3,068$3,140Amortization of intangible assets is as follows:(in millions)20212020Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution$178$175Disney Parks, Experiences and Products108109TFCF and Hulu1,7571,921Total amortization of intangible assets$2,043$2,205Produced and licensed content costsThe DMED segment incurs costs to produce and license film, episodic television and other content. Production costs include spend on content internally produced at our studios such as live-action and animated films, episodic series, specials, shorts and theatrical stage plays. Production costs also include original content commissioned from third party studios. Programming costs include content rights licensed from third parties for use on the Company’s Linear Networks and DTC streaming services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities.46TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company’s production and programming activity for fiscal 2021 and 2020 are as follows:(in millions)20212020Beginning balances:Production and programming assets$27,193 $27,407 Programming liabilities(4,099) (4,061) 23,094 23,346 Spending:Licensed programming and rights12,412 12,077 Produced content12,848 8,104 25,260 20,181 Amortization:Licensed programming and rights(12,784) (11,241) Produced content(8,175) (9,337) (20,959) (20,578) Change in production and programming costs4,301 (397) Other non-cash activity224 145 Ending balances:Production and programming assets31,732 27,193 Programming liabilities(4,113) (4,099) $27,619 $23,094 The Company currently expects its fiscal 2022 spend on produced and licensed content, including sports rights, to be as much as approximately $33 billion, or approximately $8 billion more than fiscal 2021 spend of $25 billion. The increase is driven by higher spend to support our DTC expansion and generally assumes no significant disruptions to production due to COVID-19. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s contractual commitments to acquire sports and broadcast programming.Commitments and guaranteesThe Company has various commitments and guarantees, such as long-term leases, purchase commitments and other executory contracts, that are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. See Notes 15 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these commitments.Legal and Tax MattersAs disclosed in Notes 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.Investing ActivitiesContinuing operationsInvesting activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal 2021 and 2020 are as follows:(in millions)20212020Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution$862 $783 Disney Parks, Experiences and ProductsDomestic1,597 2,145 International675 759 Total Disney Parks, Experiences and Products2,272 2,904 Corporate444 335 $3,578 $4,022 Capital expenditures at the DMED segment primarily reflect investments in technology and in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.47TABLE OF CONTENTSCapital expenditures at the DPEP segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The decrease in capital expenditures at our domestic parks and resorts in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was driven by the temporary suspension of certain capital projects since the onset of COVID-19 although spending increased in the latter part of fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increase in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to higher spending on facilities.The Company currently expects its fiscal 2022 capital expenditures will be approximately $6.1 billion compared to fiscal 2021 capital expenditures of $3.6 billion. The increase in capital expenditures is due to higher spending on cruise ship fleet expansion, Corporate facilities and production facilities and technology at the DMED segment.Other Investing ActivitiesCash provided by other investing activities of $407 million in fiscal 2021 and $172 million in fiscal 2020 reflects proceeds from the sales of investments.Financing ActivitiesContinuing operationsCash used in financing activities was $4.4 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8.5 billion in fiscal 2020. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was due to a reduction in borrowings and the purchase of a redeemable non-controlling interest, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of stock options. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 reflected a reduction in net borrowings of $3.7 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to proceeds from net borrowings of $11.2 billion in fiscal 2020. Additionally, we paid a cash dividend of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to no dividend in fiscal 2021.Borrowings activities and otherDuring the year ended October 2, 2021, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:(in millions)October 3, 2020BorrowingsPaymentsOtherActivityOctober 2, 2021Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months(1)$— $— $— $— $— Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months2,023 2,221 (2,247) (5) 1,992 U.S. dollar denominated notes(2)52,736 — (3,510) (136) 49,090 Asia Theme Parks borrowings1,303 35 (129) 122 1,331 Foreign currency denominated debt and other(3)2,566 29 (98) (504) 1,993 $58,628 $2,285 $(5,984) $(523) $54,406 (1)Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.(2)The other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase price adjustments on debt assumed in the TFCF acquisition and debt issuance fees.(3)The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s bank facilities and debt maturities. The Company may use operating cash flows, commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities maturing in March 2022, March 2023 and March 2025, and incremental term debt issuances, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s put/call agreement with NBCU.See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding commitments to fund Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort.See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019. The Company did not declare or pay a dividend in fiscal 2021. The Company did not repurchase any of its shares in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.The Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control, including COVID-19, which has had an adverse impact on the Company’s operating cash flows. We have taken a number of measures to mitigate the impact on the Company’s financial position. See Significant Developments for the impact COVID-19 has had on our operations and mitigating measures we have taken.48TABLE OF CONTENTSWe believe that the Company’s financial condition remains strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects, although certain of these activities have been scaled back or suspended in light of COVID-19. Depending on the unknowable duration and severity of the future impacts of COVID-19 and its variants, the Company may take additional mitigating actions in the future such as continuing to not declare dividends (the Company did not pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2020 operations and has not declared or paid a dividend with respect to fiscal 2021 operations); reducing, or not making certain payments, such as some contributions to our pension and postretirement medical plans; raising additional financing; further suspending capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; or implementing additional furloughs or reductions in force. The impacts on our operating cash flows are subject to uncertainty and may require us to rely more heavily on external funding sources, such as debt and other types of financing.The Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of October 2, 2021, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Stable), respectively, and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the Company met on October 2, 2021, by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONOn March 20, 2019, as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (“TWDC”) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at October 2, 2021 was as follows:TWDCLegacy Disney(in millions)Par ValueCarrying ValuePar ValueCarrying ValueRegistered debt with unconditional guarantee$37,338 $39,162 $10,587 $10,671 The guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.Operations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.49TABLE OF CONTENTSSet forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Results of operations (in millions)2021Revenues$— Costs and expenses— Net income (loss) from continuing operations(1,847) Net income (loss)(1,847) Net income (loss) attributable to TWDC shareholders(1,847) Balance Sheet (in millions)October 2, 2021October 3, 2020Current assets$9,506 $12,899 Noncurrent assets1,689 2,076 Current liabilities6,878 6,155 Noncurrent liabilities (excluding intercompany to non-Guarantors)51,439 57,809 Intercompany payables to non-Guarantors147,629 146,748 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgement and is reviewed periodically for changes. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue (relative value). If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.50TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 2.88% at the end of fiscal 2021 from 2.82% at the end of fiscal 2020 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2021 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2022 by approximately $341 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 2, 2021 by approximately $4.0 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $292 million and $3.4 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2022 annual expense by approximately $175 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2021, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. 51TABLE OF CONTENTSThe qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.The Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.3 billion and $5.2 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.The fiscal 2020 impairment charges primarily related to impairments of MVPD agreement intangible assets ($1.9 billion) and goodwill ($3.1 billion) at the International Channels’ business. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these impairment charges.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to 52TABLE OF CONTENTSsettle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.Impacts of COVID-19 on Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn light of the currently unknown ultimate duration and severity of COVID-19, we face a greater degree of uncertainty than normal in making the judgments and estimates needed to apply our significant accounting policies and make changes to these estimates and judgements over time. This could result in meaningful impacts to our financial statements in future periods. A more detailed discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on the Accounting Policies and Estimates follows.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsCertain of our completed or in progress film and television productions have had their initial release dates delayed. The duration of the delay, market conditions when we release the content, or a change in our release strategy (e.g. bypassing certain distribution windows) could have an impact on Ultimate Revenues, which may accelerate amortization or result in an impairment of capitalized film and television production costs.Given the ongoing uncertainty around live sporting events continuing uninterrupted, the amount and timing of revenues derived from the broadcast of these events may differ from the projections of revenues that support our amortization pattern of the rights costs we pay for these events. Such changes in revenues could result in an acceleration or slowing of the amortization of our sports rights costs.Revenue RecognitionCertain of our affiliate contracts contain commitments with respect to the content to be aired on our television networks (e.g. live sports or original content). If there are delays or cancellations of live sporting events or disruptions to film and television content production activities, we may need to assess the impact on our contractual obligations and adjust the revenue that we recognize related to these contracts.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsGiven the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 across our businesses, the projected cash flows that we use to assess the fair value of our businesses and assets for purposes of impairment testing are subject to greater uncertainty than normal. If in the future we reduce our estimate of cash flow projections, we may need to impair some of these assets.Prior to the Company’s reorganization in October 2020, the former Direct-to-Consumer & International segment included an International Channels reporting unit, which was comprised of the Company’s international television networks. Our international television networks primarily derive revenues from affiliate fees charged to MVPDs for the right to deliver our programming under multi-year licensing agreements and the sales of advertising time/space on the networks.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we assessed the International Channels’ long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded impairments of $1.9 billion primarily related to MVPD agreement intangible assets and $3.1 billion related to goodwill.As of October 2, 2021, the remaining balance of our international MVPD agreement intangible assets was $2.2 billion, primarily related to our channel businesses in Latin America and India.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the impairment tests performed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.Risk Management ContractsThe Company employs a variety of financial instruments (derivatives) including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements and forward and option contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, our projected cash flows or projected usage of commodities are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty, which may cause us to recognize gains or losses on our hedging instruments in different periods than the hedged transaction.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” made by or on behalf of the Company. We may from time to time make written or oral statements that are “forward-looking,” including statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our 53TABLE OF CONTENTSshareholders. Such statements may, for example, express expectations, projections, estimates, plans or future impacts; actions that we may take (or not take); developments beyond our control, including changes in domestic or global economic conditions; or other statements that are not historical in nature. All forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management’s views and assumptions regarding future events and business performance as of the time the statements are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update its disclosure relating to forward-looking matters. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of important factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting these expectations, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports we file with the SEC, are set forth under Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Report on Form 10-K as well as in this Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Item 1 - Business.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.54TABLE OF CONTENTSVAR on a combined basis increased to $364 million at October 2, 2021 from $323 million at October 3, 2020.The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):Fiscal 2021Interest RateSensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCurrencySensitiveFinancialInstrumentsEquity SensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCommodity Sensitive Financial InstrumentsCombinedPortfolioYear end fiscal 2021 VAR$357$44$37$1$364Average VAR34234481345Highest VAR38044651372Lowest VAR29023371296Year end fiscal 2020 VAR 30429811323The VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of October 2, 2021 and accordingly has been excluded from the above table.",2023-12-30 17:48:22.874368

It includes the following sections:•Significant Developments•Consolidated Results and Non-Segment Items•Business Segment Results •Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses•Restructuring Activities•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information•Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesIn Item 7, we discuss fiscal 2022 and 2021 results and comparisons of fiscal 2022 results to fiscal 2021 results. Discussions of fiscal 2020 results and comparisons of fiscal 2021 results to fiscal 2020 results can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021.SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTSLeadership Change and Pending RestructuringAs previously announced, on November 20, 2022, Robert A. Iger returned to the Company as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and a director. Mr. Iger previously spent more than four decades at the Company, including 15 years as CEO. In announcing Mr. Iger’s appointment, the Company noted he has agreed to serve as CEO for two years, with a mandate from the Company’s Board of Directors “to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the Board in developing a successor to lead the Company at the completion of his term.” Mr. Iger succeeded Robert A. Chapek, who had served as CEO since 2020. As contemplated by the leadership change announcement, we anticipate that within the coming months Mr. Iger will initiate organizational and operating changes within the Company to address the Board’s goals. While the plans are in early stages, changes in our structure and operations, including within DMED (and including possibly our distribution approach and the businesses/distribution platforms selected for the initial distribution of content), can be expected. The restructuring and change in business strategy, once determined, could result in impairment charges.COVID-19 PandemicSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.The impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.Additionally, see Part I., Item 1A. Risk Factors - The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND NON-SEGMENT ITEMSRevenues for fiscal 2022 increased 23%, or $15.3 billion, to $82.7 billion; net income attributable to Disney increased $1.2 billion, to income of $3.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Disney increased to income of $1.75 compared to income of $1.11 in the prior year. The EPS increase was due to higher segment 32TABLE OF CONTENTSoperating results, partially offset by higher income tax expense in the current year compared to the prior year. Higher segment operating results reflecting growth at DPEP, partially offset by lower operating results at DMED.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 20%, or $12.4 billion, to $74.2 billion, due to increased revenues at our theme parks and resorts, higher DTC subscription revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher theatrical distribution and advertising revenue. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenue for amounts to early terminate certain license agreements with a customer for film and television content, which was delivered in previous years, in order for the Company to use the content primarily on our DTC services (Content License Early Termination). The increase at theme parks and resorts was due to higher volumes, which generally reflected the impact of operating with capacity restrictions in the prior year as a result of COVID-19, and higher average per capita ticket revenue. The increase in DTC subscription revenue was due to subscriber growth and higher average rates.Product revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 51%, or $2.9 billion, to $8.5 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2022 increased 19%, or $7.8 billion, to $49.0 billion, due to higher programming and production costs, increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts and higher technical support costs at Direct-to-Consumer. The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher costs at Direct-to-Consumer, increased sports programming costs and an increase in production cost amortization due to theatrical revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by lower programming and production costs as a result of international channel closures.Cost of products for fiscal 2022 increased 36%, or $1.4 billion, to $5.4 billion, due to higher merchandise, food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2022 increased 21%, or $2.9 billion, to $16.4 billion, primarily due to higher marketing costs at our DTC and, to a lesser extent, theatrical distribution and parks and experiences businesses.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2022 were $0.2 billion primarily due to the impairment of an intangible and other assets related to our businesses in Russia. We may incur additional charges to exit these businesses, which are not anticipated to be material.Restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were $0.7 billion due to $0.4 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shut-down of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe and $0.3 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of TFCF and workforce reductions at DPEP.Other Income (expense), net(in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)fuboTV gain$— $186 (100) %German FTA gain— 126 (100) %DraftKings loss(663) (111) >(100) %Other, net(4) — nmOther income (expense), net$(667) $201 nmIn fiscal 2022, the Company recognized a non-cash loss of $663 million from the adjustment of its investment in DraftKings Inc.

This increase was partially offset by investment losses in the current year compared to investment gains in the prior year.Equity in the Income of InvesteesEquity in the income of investees increased $55 million to $816 million in the current year due to higher income from A+E Television Networks (A+E) and the comparison to investment impairments in the prior year.Effective Income Tax Rate20222021Income from continuing operations before income taxes$5,285 $2,561 Income tax expense on continuing operations1,732 25 Effective income tax rate - continuing operations32.8%1.0%The effective income tax rate in the current year was higher than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to higher effective tax rates on foreign earnings. The effective income tax rate in the prior year was lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to favorable adjustments related to prior years and excess tax benefits on employee share-based awards, partially offset by higher effective tax rates on foreign earnings. Higher effective tax rates on foreign earnings in both the current and prior year reflected the impact of foreign losses and, to a lesser extent, foreign tax credits for which we are unable to recognize a tax benefit.Noncontrolling Interests(in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests$(360)$(512)30%The decrease in net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to higher losses at Shanghai Disney Resort and higher losses at our DTC sports business, partially offset by higher results for ESPN.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses. DMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.The Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.The Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.The Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.DPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. 35TABLE OF CONTENTSSignificant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include technology support costs, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income, and management uses total segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses separate from non-operating factors. Total segment operating income is not a financial measure defined by GAAP, should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that information about total segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company’s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both operations and other factors that affect reported results.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 2% from higher contractual rates.37TABLE OF CONTENTSAdvertising revenue is as follows:(in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Cable$3,880 $3,681 5 %Broadcasting3,141 3,239 (3) %Domestic Channels7,021 6,920 1 %International Channels2,107 1,933 9 %$9,128 $8,853 3 %The increase in Cable advertising revenue was due to increases of 3% from higher impressions and 2% from higher rates. The increase in impressions reflected higher average viewership, partially offset by fewer units delivered.The decrease in Broadcasting advertising revenue was due to a decrease of 12% from fewer impressions at ABC, reflecting lower average viewership, partially offset by an increase of 10% from higher rates at ABC.The increase in International Channels advertising revenue was due to increases of 8% from higher impressions and 7% from higher rates, partially offset by 7% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The increase in impressions reflected higher average viewership, partially offset by the impact of channel closures. The increase in average viewership benefited from airing more cricket matches in the current year. The current year included the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 World Cup, more Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) matches and the Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Asia Cup, partially offset by fewer Indian Premier League (IPL) matches in the current year compared to the prior year. The ICC T20 World Cup generally occurs every two years and was not held in the prior year due to COVID-19. The ACC Asia Cup was rescheduled from 2020 to the current year as a result of COVID-19. The increase in BCCI cricket matches aired in the current year was driven by COVID-19-related cancellations of certain BCCI matches in the prior year.Other revenue increased $95 million, to $683 million from $588 million, due to sub-licensing fees from ICC T20 World Cup matches and higher sub-licensing fees from BCCI cricket matches in the current year compared to the prior year.

The increase in sports programming costs was due to higher rights costs for NFL and College Football Playoffs (CFP) and an increase in sports production costs reflecting the return of ESPN-hosted events, which were canceled in the prior year due to COVID-19, partially offset by lower rights costs for MLB and NBA programming. Higher NFL programming costs were due to airing four additional regular season games in the current year compared to the prior year and contractual rate increases. The increase in CFP rights costs was due to higher contractual rates. Lower MLB programming costs were due to airing 29 games of the 2022 regular season under our new contract and one 2021 season playoff game in the current year compared to 92 games of the 2021 regular season in the prior year. The decrease in NBA programming costs was due to the comparison to airing four games of the 2020 NBA Finals in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, partially offset by contractual rate increases. Fiscal 2021 also included the 2021 NBA Finals and fiscal 2022 included the 2022 NBA finals. Lower non-sports programming costs were due to a lower cost mix of programming at FX Channels.Programming and production costs at Broadcasting were comparable to the prior year as higher costs for non-primetime programming were largely offset by lower costs for primetime programming. Increased costs for non-primetime programming were primarily due to higher costs for news programming and higher average costs and more hours of sports programming, while decreased costs for primetime programming were due to lower average costs for reality and scripted programming. 38TABLE OF CONTENTSProgramming and production costs at the International Channels were comparable to the prior year as an increase in sports programming costs, reflecting more cricket matches in the current year and higher average costs per match for BCCI and IPL cricket matches, was largely offset by the impact of channel closures and a favorable foreign exchange impact. Selling, general administrative and other costs increased $128 million, to $3,619 million from $3,491 million, driven by higher labor-related costs.Depreciation and amortization decreased $23 million, to $145 million from $168 million, driven by fully depreciated assets.Equity in the Income of InvesteesIncome from equity investees increased $57 million, to $838 million from $781 million, due to higher income from A+E and the comparison to impairments in the prior year. The increase at A+E resulted from lower programming costs and higher program sales, partially offset by decreases in affiliate and advertising revenue and higher marketing costs.Operating Income from Linear NetworksOperating income increased 1%, to $8,518 million from $8,407 million due to increases at Broadcasting and Cable and higher income from our equity investees, partially offset by a decrease at the International Channels.

The increase in impressions at Disney+ was primarily due to airing the ICC T20 World Cup and ACC Asia Cup in the current year, neither of which were aired in the prior year.39TABLE OF CONTENTSThe decrease in TV/SVOD distribution and other revenue was due to the absence of Disney+ Premier Access revenues in the current year compared to revenues for Black Widow, Raya and the Last Dragon, Jungle Cruise and Cruella in the prior year. To a lesser extent, the decrease also reflected lower UFC pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per event.The following table presents additional information about our Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu product offerings(1).Paid subscribers(2) as of:(in millions)October 1, 2022October 2, 2021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Disney+Domestic (U.S. and Canada)46.4 38.8 20 %International (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)(3)56.5 36.0 57 %Disney+ Core(4)102.9 74.8 38 %Disney+ Hotstar61.3 43.3 42 %Total Disney+(4)164.2 118.1 39 %ESPN+24.3 17.1 42 %HuluSVOD Only42.8 39.7 8 %Live TV + SVOD4.4 4.0 10 %Total Hulu(4)47.2 43.8 8 %Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber(5) for the fiscal year ended:20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Disney+Domestic (U.S. and Canada)$6.34$6.33— %International (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)(3)6.105.3115 %Disney+ Core6.225.876 %Disney+ Hotstar0.880.6829 %Global Disney+4.244.084 %ESPN+4.804.575 %HuluSVOD Only12.7212.86(1) %Live TV + SVOD87.6281.358 %(1)In the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or as a package that includes all three services (the SVOD Bundle). Effective December 21, 2021, Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+ (the new Hulu Live TV + SVOD offering), whereas previously, Hulu Live TV + SVOD was offered as a standalone service or with Disney+ and ESPN+ as optional additions (the old Hulu Live TV + SVOD offering). Effective March 15, 2022, Hulu SVOD Only is also offered with Disney+ as an optional add-on. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries, we offer Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which is available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites, through third-party platforms/apps or via wholesale arrangements. (2)Reflects subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to the SVOD Bundle are counted as a paid subscriber for each service included in the SVOD Bundle and subscribers to the Hulu Live TV + SVOD offerings are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ offerings. A Hulu SVOD Only subscriber that adds Disney+ is counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu SVOD Only and Disney+ offerings. In Latin America, if a subscriber has either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribes to Combo+, the subscriber is counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those 40TABLE OF CONTENTSwho receive a service through wholesale arrangements including those for which we receive a fee for the distribution of the service to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions. (3)Includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada and the Star+ service in Latin America.(4)Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.(5)Average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses) and premium and feature add-on revenue but excludes Premier Access and Pay-Per-View revenue. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail price of each service on a standalone basis. Revenue for the new Hulu Live TV + SVOD offering is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the SVOD Bundle. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for domestic Disney+ was comparable to the prior year, as an increase in retail pricing and a lower mix of wholesale subscribers was essentially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for international Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) increased from $5.31 to $6.10 due to increases in retail pricing, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ Hotstar increased from $0.68 to $0.88 driven by higher per-subscriber advertising revenue and increases in retail pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of wholesale subscribers.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for ESPN+ increased from $4.57 to $4.80 primarily due to an increase in retail pricing, a lower mix of annual subscribers and higher per-subscriber advertising revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings.The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu SVOD Only service decreased from $12.86 to $12.72 driven by lower per-subscriber advertising revenue, a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings and, to a lesser extent, to promotional offerings, partially offset by an increase in retail pricing. The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for the Hulu Live TV + SVOD service increased from $81.35 to $87.62 driven by an increase in retail pricing and higher per-subscriber advertising revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:(in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Programming and production costsDisney+$(5,027) $(2,915) (72) %Hulu(7,564) (6,680) (13) %ESPN+ and other(1,564) (1,121) (40) %Total programming and production costs(14,155) (10,716) (32) %Other operating expense(3,285) (2,518) (30) %$(17,440) $(13,234) (32) %The increase in programming and production costs at Disney+ was due to more content provided on the service and, to a lesser extent, higher average cost programming, which reflected an increased mix of original content.The increase in programming and production costs at Hulu was due to more content provided on the service and higher subscriber-based fees for programming the Live TV service, which reflected rate increases and an increase in the number of subscribers. The increase in programming and production costs at ESPN+ and other was due to new NHL programming and higher rights costs for soccer and golf programming.41TABLE OF CONTENTSOther operating expenses increased due to higher technology and distribution costs at Disney+ reflecting growth in existing markets and, to a lesser extent, expansion to new markets.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $1,325 million, to $5,760 million from $4,435 million, due to higher marketing costs at Disney+ and Hulu.Depreciation and amortization increased $44 million, to $373 million from $329 million, primarily due to increased investment in technology assets at Disney+.Operating Loss from Direct-to-ConsumerOperating loss from Direct-to-Consumer increased $2,336 million, to $4,015 million from $1,679 million due to a higher loss at Disney+ and, to a lesser extent, lower operating income at Hulu and a higher loss at ESPN+.Content Sales/Licensing and OtherOperating results for Content Sales/Licensing and Other are as follows:(in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)RevenuesTV/SVOD distribution$3,781 $4,206 (10) %Theatrical distribution1,875 920 >100 %Home entertainment820 1,014 (19) %Other1,670 1,206 38 %Total revenues8,146 7,346 11 %Operating expenses(5,499) (4,536) (21) %Selling, general, administrative and other(2,638) (1,963) (34) %Depreciation and amortization(296) (294) (1) %Equity in the income of investees— 14 — %Operating Income (Loss)$(287) $567 nmRevenuesThe decrease in TV/SVOD distribution revenue reflected lower sales volumes, which included the impact from the shift from licensing our content to third parties to distributing it on our DTC streaming services.The increase in theatrical distribution revenue was due to more titles released in the current year compared to the prior year and revenue in the current year from the co-production of Marvel’s Spider-Man: No Way Home. Although COVID-19 continues to impact our theatrical distribution business in certain markets, the impact in fiscal 2021 was more significant due to theater closures and capacity restrictions in many territories in which we operate. Titles released in the current year included Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder, Eternals, Encanto and Lightyear. Titles released in the prior year included Shang-Chi & The Legend of The Ten Rings, Black Widow and Free Guy.The decrease in home entertainment revenue was due to lower unit sales despite the benefit of more new release titles in the current year. Net effective pricing was comparable to the prior year as lower unit pricing was offset by a higher mix of new release titles, which have a higher sales price than catalog titles.The increase in other revenue was due to more stage play performances in the current year as productions were generally shut down in the prior year due to COVID-19.Operating expenses are as follows:(in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Programming and production costs$(4,215)$(3,611)(17) %Distribution costs and cost of goods sold (1,284)(925)(39) %$(5,499)$(4,536)(21) %The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher production cost amortization, driven by more theatrical releases, and, to a lesser extent, higher film cost impairments.

Higher attendance reflected increases at Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and, to a lesser extent, Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. Growth in average per capita ticket revenue was due to the introduction of Genie+ and Lightning Lane at our domestic parks in the first quarter of the current fiscal year and higher average ticket prices at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris, partially offset by lower average ticket prices at Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort.Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increases of 82% from higher volumes and 9% from higher average guest spending.Growth in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 51% from higher occupied hotel room nights, 32% from an increase in passenger cruise days and 17% from higher average daily hotel room rates. Merchandise licensing and retail revenue was comparable to the prior year, as a decrease of 7% from retail was offset by an increase of 7% from merchandise licensing. The decrease in retail revenues was due to the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe in the second half of fiscal 2021. The revenue growth at merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher sales of merchandise based on Mickey and Friends, Star Wars, Encanto, Spider-Man and Disney Princesses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from merchandise based on Frozen. The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to higher sponsorship revenues and an increase in royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.The following table presents supplemental park and hotel statistics: DomesticInternational(1)Total 202220212022202120222021ParksIncrease (decrease)Attendance(2)nm(17)%54 %(4)%87 %(14)%Per Capita Guest Spending(3)13 %17 %21 %(3)%18 %11 %HotelsOccupancy(4)82 %42 %56 %21 %76 %37 %Available Room Nights (in thousands)(5)10,07310,4513,1793,17913,25213,630Increase (decrease)Per Room Guest Spending(6)19 %1 %— %22 %16 %4 %(1)Per capita guest spending growth rate and per room guest spending growth rate exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The increase in operating cash flow at DPEP was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating cash disbursements due to higher operating expenses. The decrease in operating cash flow at DMED was due to higher operating cash disbursements and higher spending on film and television productions, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts.

Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was due to a reduction in borrowings. The increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 reflected a higher reduction in net borrowings ($4.0 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2021) and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($0.1 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $0.4 billion in fiscal 2021). In addition, cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 included a $0.4 billion purchase of a redeemable noncontrolling interest. 48TABLE OF CONTENTSBorrowings activities and otherDuring the year ended October 1, 2022, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:(in millions)October 2, 2021BorrowingsPaymentsOtherActivityOctober 1, 2022Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months(1)$— $50 $— $— $50 Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months1,992 2,417 (2,801) 4 1,612 U.S. dollar denominated notes(2)49,090 — (3,857) (142) 45,091 Asia Theme Parks borrowings(3)1,331 333 (159) (80) 1,425 Foreign currency denominated debt and other(4)1,993 — — (1,802) 191 $54,406 $2,800 $(6,817) $(2,020) $48,369 (1)Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.(2)The other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and debt issuance fees.(3)See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding commitments to fund the Asia Theme Parks.(4)The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s bank facilities and debt maturities. The Company may use operating cash flows, commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities and incremental term debt issuances to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s put/call agreement with NBCU.The Company did not declare or pay a dividend or repurchase any of its shares in fiscal 2022 or 2021.The Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control, including COVID-19, which had an adverse impact on the Company’s operating cash flows in fiscal 2021 and, to a lesser extent, fiscal 2022. We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as continuing to not declare dividends (the Company did not pay a dividend with respect to fiscal 2021 operations and has not declared or paid a dividend with respect to fiscal 2022 operations); raising financing; suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; or implementing furloughs or reductions in force.The Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of October 1, 2022, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were BBB+ and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On October 1, 2022, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONOn March 20, 2019, as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (“TWDC”) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with 49TABLE OF CONTENTSthe closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at October 1, 2022 was as follows:TWDCLegacy Disney(in millions)Par ValueCarrying ValuePar ValueCarrying ValueRegistered debt with unconditional guarantee$35,343 $35,736 $9,105 $8,851 The guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.Operations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.Set forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Results of operations (in millions)2022Revenues$— Costs and expenses— Net income (loss) from continuing operations(742) Net income (loss)(742) Net income (loss) attributable to TWDC shareholders(742) Balance Sheet (in millions)October 1, 2022October 2, 2021Current assets$5,665 $9,506 Noncurrent assets1,948 1,689 Current liabilities3,741 6,878 Noncurrent liabilities (excluding intercompany to non-Guarantors)46,218 51,439 Intercompany payables to non-Guarantors148,958 147,629 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.50TABLE OF CONTENTSProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factors affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues are program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. For example, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, for certain content, we are accelerating the rate of amortization in early periods, slowing the rate in later periods and have adjusted the useful life based on historical and projected usage patterns. The most sensitive factors affecting projected usage are historical and estimated viewing patterns. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.For content that is predominantly monetized as a group, the aggregate unamortized costs of the group are compared to the present value of the discounted cash flows using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written-off immediately. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of assessing recoverability.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value). Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 5.44% at the end of fiscal 2022 from 2.88% at the end of fiscal 2021 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2022 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2023 by approximately $242 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at October 1, 2022 by approximately $2.3 billion. A one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $59 million and $2.0 billion, respectively.51TABLE OF CONTENTSTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2023 annual expense by approximately $172 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2022, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment.The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units including goodwill, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. We generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses as well as the discount rates used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. In times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the Company’s long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units. If we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.To test its other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions, and changes in projected future cash flows. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.52TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to our businesses in Russia. The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-53TABLE OF CONTENTScurrency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.Our objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.VAR on a combined basis increased to $395 million at October 1, 2022 from $364 million at October 2, 2021.The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):Fiscal 2022Interest RateSensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCurrencySensitiveFinancialInstrumentsEquity SensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCommodity Sensitive Financial InstrumentsCombinedPortfolioYear end fiscal 2022 VAR$376$71$20$4$395Average VAR41562254426Highest VAR45572327479Lowest VAR37646202394Year end fiscal 2021 VAR 35744371364The VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of October 1, 2022 and has been excluded from the above table.",2023-12-30 17:48:21.425929

Fiscal 2022 and 2021 segment financial information has been recast for the following:•The prior Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment has been reorganized into the Entertainment and Sports segments•A portion of Consumer Products revenues is recognized at the Entertainment segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment2023 vs. 2022Revenues for fiscal 2023 increased 7%, or $6.2 billion, to $88.9 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased $0.8 billion to income of $2.4 billion compared to $3.1 billion in the prior year; and diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations attributable to Disney decreased to $1.29 compared to $1.75 in the prior year. In the prior year, the Company recorded a reduction in revenue of $1.0 billion for amounts to early terminate certain license agreements with a customer for film and television content, which was delivered in previous years, in order for the Company to use the content primarily at our Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer services (Content License Early Termination). The EPS decrease was due to higher restructuring and impairment charges and lower operating income at Entertainment. These decreases were partially offset by the comparison to the impact of the Content License Early Termination, higher operating income at Experiences in the current year compared to the prior year and investment gains in the current year compared to investment losses in the prior year.RevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2023 increased 7%, or $5.4 billion, to $79.6 billion, due to growth at our theme parks and resorts, higher subscription revenue, an increase in theatrical distribution revenue and the comparison to the revenue reduction for the Content License Early Termination in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in advertising revenue, TV/VOD distribution sales and affiliate revenue. Growth at theme parks and resorts was due to higher volumes and guest spending. The increase in subscription revenue was due to subscriber growth and higher rates. Service revenues reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to an unfavorable movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the impact of our hedging program (Foreign Exchange Impact).Product revenues for fiscal 2023 increased 10%, or $0.8 billion, to $9.3 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts, partially offset by lower home entertainment volumes. Product revenues reflected an approximate 2 percent point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2023 increased 9%, or $4.2 billion, to $53.1 billion, due to higher programming and production costs, inflation and increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts and, to a lesser extent, higher technology and distribution costs at Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer. The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher costs at Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer and increased production cost amortization resulting from higher theatrical revenue, partially offset by a decrease in production cost amortization due to lower TV/VOD distribution sales. Costs of services reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Cost of products for fiscal 2023 increased 11%, or $0.6 billion, to $6.1 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage and cost inflation at our theme parks and resorts.

These decreases were partially offset by higher theatrical marketing costs and an increase in marketing costs at theme parks and resorts. Selling, general, administrative and other costs reflected an approximate 1 percentage point decrease due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Depreciation and amortization increased 4 %, or $0.2 billion, to $5.4 billion due to higher depreciation at our domestic parks and resorts including accelerated depreciation related to the closure of Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser and depreciation for the Disney Wish, which launched in the fourth quarter of the prior year, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of TFCF and Hulu.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2023 were $3,892 million comprising: •$2,577 million for the Content Impairment charge (see Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements)•$721 million of goodwill impairments (see Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements)31TABLE OF CONTENTS•$357 million for severance•$141 million for an impairment of an equity investment•$96 million for exiting our businesses in Russia and other chargesRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2022 were $237 million primarily due to the impairment of an intangible and other assets related to exiting our businesses in Russia.Other Income (expense), net($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)DraftKings gain (loss)$169 $(663) nmOther, net(73) (4) >(100) %Other income (expense), net$96 $(667) nmIn fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a gain of $169 million on its investment in DraftKings, Inc.

The EPS increase was due to growth at Experiences, partially offset by lower operating results at Entertainment, higher income tax expense and the Content License Early Termination.33TABLE OF CONTENTSRevenuesService revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 20%, or $12.4 billion, to $74.2 billion, due to increased revenues at our theme parks and resorts, subscription revenue growth and, to a lesser extent, higher theatrical distribution and advertising revenue. These increases were partially offset by the Content License Early Termination. The increase at theme parks and resorts was due to higher volumes, which generally reflected the impact of operating with capacity restrictions in fiscal 2021 as a result of COVID-19, and higher average per capita ticket revenue. The increase in subscription revenue was due to subscriber growth and higher average rates. Service revenues reflected an approximate 1 percent point decrease due to an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Product revenues for fiscal 2022 increased 51%, or $2.9 billion, to $8.5 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts. Costs and expensesCost of services for fiscal 2022 increased 19%, or $7.8 billion, to $49.0 billion, due to higher programming and production costs, increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts and higher technology and distribution costs at Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer. The increase in programming and production costs was due to higher costs at Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer, an increase in sports right costs and higher production cost amortization due to theatrical revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by lower programming and production costs as a result of international channel closures.Cost of products for fiscal 2022 increased 36%, or $1.4 billion, to $5.4 billion, due to higher merchandise, food and beverage sales at our theme parks and resorts.Selling, general, administrative and other costs for fiscal 2022 increased 21%, or $2.9 billion, to $16.4 billion, primarily due to higher marketing costs at Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer and, to a lesser extent, our theatrical distribution and parks and experiences businesses.Restructuring and Impairment ChargesRestructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2022 were $0.2 billion primarily due to the impairment of an intangible and other assets related to exiting our businesses in Russia.Restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2021 were $0.7 billion comprising:•$0.4 billion of asset impairments and severance costs related to the shut-down of an animation studio and the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe•$0.3 billion of severance and other costs in connection with the integration of TFCF and workforce reductions at ExperiencesOther Income (expense), net($ in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)fuboTV gain$— $186 (100) %German FTA gain— 126 (100) %DraftKings loss(663) (111) >(100) %Other, net(4) — nmOther income (expense), net$(667) $201 nmIn fiscal 2022, the Company recognized a non-cash loss of $663 million from the adjustment of our investment in DraftKings to fair value.In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a $186 million gain from the sale of our investment in fuboTV Inc.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.The Entertainment segment comprises three significant lines of business: •Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising. In recent years, revenues from affiliate fees have declined due to fewer subscribers to MVPD services that carry our linear networks. We anticipate this trend to continue, although the extent and duration is uncertain. In addition, these revenues will be impacted and may be further impacted in the future from the lapse of carriage agreements to certain networks. •Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising•Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment. Operating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor, distribution costs and cost of sales. Programming and production costs include the following:•Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights•Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live•Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)•Amortization of participations and residual obligations•Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Star+Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment’s businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the business of initial exploitation.The Sports segment primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees, advertising, subscription fees, pay-per-view fees and sub-licensing of sports rights. Linear sports channels are experiencing declines in subscribers that are directionally consistent with those at the linear networks in the Entertainment segment. Operating expenses consist primarily of programming and 36TABLE OF CONTENTSproduction costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs related to live sports and other programming.The Experiences segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort. Significant expenses include operating labor, costs of goods sold, infrastructure costs, depreciation and other operating expenses. Infrastructure costs include technology support costs, repairs and maintenance, utilities and fuel, property taxes, retail occupancy costs, insurance and transportation. Other operating expenses include costs for such items as supplies, commissions and entertainment offerings.The following transactions are recognized in segment revenues and eliminated in total Company revenue:•Fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live•Fees paid by the Entertainment segment to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Star+BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS - 2023 vs. 2022The following table presents revenues from our operating segments and other components of revenues:($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Entertainment$40,635 $39,569 3 %Sports17,111 17,270 (1) %Experiences32,549 28,085 16 %Eliminations(1,397) (1,179) (18) %Content License Early Termination— (1,023) 100 %Revenues$88,898 $82,722 7 %The following table presents income from our operating segments and other components of income from continuing operations before income taxes:($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Entertainment operating income$1,444 $2,126 (32) %Sports operating income2,465 2,710 (9) %Experiences operating income8,954 7,285 23 %Content License Early Termination— (1,023)100 %Corporate and unallocated shared expenses(1,147) (1,159) 1 %Restructuring and impairment charges(1)(3,836) (237) >(100) %Other income (expense), net96 (667)nmInterest expense, net(1,209) (1,397) 13 %TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization(1,998) (2,353) 15 %Income from continuing operations before income taxes$4,769 $5,285 (10) %(1) Includes the A+E gain. 37TABLE OF CONTENTSEntertainment Revenue and operating results for Entertainment are as follows:($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Revenues:Linear Networks$11,701 $12,828 (9) %Direct-to-Consumer19,886 17,975 11 %Content Sales/Licensing and Other9,048 8,766 3 %$40,635 $39,569 3 %Segment operating income (loss):Linear Networks$4,119 $5,198 (21) %Direct-to-Consumer(2,496) (3,424)27 %Content Sales/Licensing and Other(179)352 nm$1,444 $2,126 (32) %Linear NetworksOperating results for Linear Networks are as follows:($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)RevenuesAffiliate fees$7,369 $7,739 (5) %Advertising4,159 4,877 (15) %Other173 212 (18) %Total revenues11,701 12,828 (9) %Operating expenses(5,577) (5,777) 3 %Selling, general, administrative and other(2,641) (2,571) (3) %Depreciation and amortization(54) (65) 17 %Equity in the income of investees690 783 (12) %Operating Income$4,119 $5,198 (21) %RevenuesAffiliate fees are as follows:($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Domestic$6,136 $6,257 (2) %International1,233 1,482 (17) %$7,369 $7,739 (5) %The decrease in domestic affiliate fees reflected a decrease of 5% from fewer subscribers, partially offset by an increase of 4% from higher contractual rates.

International programming and production costs decreased primarily due to a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact and the impact of channel closures. The decrease in other operating expenses was due to the realignment of certain costs primarily to selling, general and administrative costs, lower technology and distribution costs and a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact.Selling, general administrative and other costs increased $70 million, to $2,641 million from $2,571 million. The increase includes the realignment of certain costs previously primarily reported in other operating expenses and higher labor-related costs, partially offset by lower marketing costs.Equity in the Income of InvesteesIncome from equity investees decreased $93 million, to $690 million from $783 million, due to lower income from A+E attributable to decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher program sales income.Operating Income from Linear NetworksOperating income decreased 21%, to $4,119 million from $5,198 million due to lower results both domestically and internationally.

The decrease in impressions at Disney+ was due to the comparison to Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar in the prior year, as we did not renew the digital rights beginning with the 2023 season. The decrease was partially offset by the U.S. launch of ad-supported Disney+ in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.The following table presents additional information about Disney+ and Hulu(1).Paid subscribers(1) as of:(in millions)September 30, 2023October 1, 2022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Disney+Domestic (U.S. and Canada)46.5 46.4 — %International (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)(1)66.1 56.5 17 %Disney+ Core(2)112.6 102.9 9 %Disney+ Hotstar37.6 61.3 (39) %HuluSVOD Only43.9 42.8 3 %Live TV + SVOD4.6 4.4 5 %Total Hulu(2)48.5 47.2 3 %40TABLE OF CONTENTSAverage Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber(1) for the fiscal year ended:20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Disney+Domestic (U.S. and Canada)$6.97$6.3410 %International (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)(1)5.936.10(3) %Disney+ Core6.396.223 %Disney+ Hotstar0.660.88(25) %HuluSVOD Only12.1712.72(4) %Live TV + SVOD90.5287.623 %(1)See discussion on page 66—DTC Product Descriptions, Key Definitions and Supplemental Information(2)Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.Domestic Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $6.34 to $6.97 due to an increase in average retail pricing and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings.International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) average monthly revenue per paid subscriber decreased from $6.10 to $5.93 due to a higher mix of subscribers from lower-priced markets and an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact, partially offset by an increase in average retail pricing, a lower mix of wholesale subscribers and an increase in wholesale pricing.Disney+ Hotstar average monthly revenue per paid subscriber decreased from $0.88 to $0.66 due to lower advertising revenue, partially offset by a lower mix of wholesale subscribers.Hulu SVOD Only average monthly revenue per paid subscriber decreased from $12.72 to $12.17 due to lower advertising revenue, a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings and lower per-subscriber premium and feature add-on revenue, partially offset by an increase in average retail pricing.

The increase in international ESPN advertising revenue was due to an increase of 16% from higher impressions, partially offset by a decrease of 6% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The increase in impressions was attributable to higher average viewership.Lower Star advertising revenue was due to decreases of 38% from fewer impressions, 14% from lower rates and 7% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. Fewer impressions reflected a decrease in average units delivered and, to a lesser extent, fewer IPL matches aired in the current year compared to the prior year as matches from the 2021 season shifted into fiscal 2022 due to COVID-19.Growth in subscription fees reflected increases of 19% from higher rates and 18% from more subscribers.The increase in other revenue was primarily due to higher fees received for programming ESPN on ABC.The following table presents additional information about ESPN+:September 30, 2023October 1, 2022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Paid subscribers at fiscal year end (in millions)26.0 24.3 7 %Average Monthly Revenue per Paid Subscriber for the fiscal year$5.49 $4.80 14 %ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $4.80 to $5.49 due to an increase in retail pricing, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:($ in millions)20232022% ChangeBetter (Worse)Programming and production costsESPNDomestic$(10,221) $(10,003) (2) %International(1,127) (998) (13) %(11,348) (11,001) (3) %Star (India)(1,025) (1,284) 20 %(12,373) (12,285) (1) %Other operating expenses(941) (799) (18) %$(13,314) $(13,084) (2) %The increase in domestic ESPN programming and production costs was due to contractual rate increases for NBA and College Football Playoffs (CFP) programming, new motor sports programming and higher costs for NFL and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) programming. These increases were partially offset by lower costs for college football programming (excluding CFP) due to the non-renewal of certain contracts. NFL programming costs increased as a result of airing one additional regular season game on our linear networks in the current year compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower 44TABLE OF CONTENTScosts per game. The increase in UFC programming costs was due to airing two more events in the current year compared to the prior year and higher contractual rates. Higher international ESPN programming and production costs were driven by the impact of inflation on soccer rights costs and production costs, partially offset by a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in Star programming and production costs was due to lower costs for cricket programming and a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in cricket programming costs was attributable to fewer IPL matches in the current year compared to prior year and lower average costs per match for IPL and International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 World Cup matches.Other operating expenses increased $142 million, to $941 million from $799 million, driven by higher technology and distribution costs and the realignment of certain costs previously reported in selling, general and administrative costs.Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $127 million, to $1,314 million from $1,441 million, due to lower marketing spend and a realignment of certain costs to other operating expenses.Operating Income Operating income decreased 9%, to $2,465 million from $2,710 million due to decreases at Star and international ESPN, partially offset by an increase at domestic ESPN.

Growth in resorts and vacations revenue was due to increases of 14% from additional passenger cruise days, 4% from higher occupied hotel room nights and 3% growth from guided tours.Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was attributable to increases of 12% from higher volumes and 3% from higher average guest spending. Lower merchandise licensing and retail revenue was due to decreases of 2% from licensing, 2% from retail and 1% from an unfavorable Foreign Exchange Impact. The decrease in licensing revenue was due to lower sales of merchandise based on Star Wars, Frozen, Toy Story and Mickey and Friends, partially offset by higher minimum guarantee shortfall recognition. Lower retail revenue was primarily due to a decrease in online sales.The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was attributable to an increase in royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort and higher co-branding and sponsorship revenues, partially offset by lower real estate sales. In addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of our theme parks and resorts, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: DomesticInternational(1)Total 202320222023202220232022ParksIncrease (decrease)Attendance(2)6 %>100 %55 %54 %17 %87 %Per Capita Guest Spending(3)3 %13 %21 %24 %2 %18 %HotelsOccupancy(4)85 %82 %74 %56 %83 %76 %Available Room Nights (in thousands)(5)10,09610,0733,1783,17913,27413,252Change in Per Room Guest Spending(6)— %19 %14 %(7) %1 %15 %(1)Per capita guest spending growth rate and per room guest spending growth rate exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our attendance count includes 46TABLE OF CONTENTScomplimentary entries but excludes entries by children under the age of three.(3)Per capita guest spending is used to analyze guest spending trends and is defined as total revenue from ticket sales and sales of food, beverage and merchandise in our theme parks, divided by total theme park attendance.(4)Occupancy is used to analyze the usage of available capacity at hotels and is defined as the number of room nights occupied by guests as a percentage of available hotel room nights.(5)Available hotel room nights are defined as the total number of room nights that are available at our hotels and at DVC properties located at our theme parks and resorts that are not utilized by DVC members. Available hotel room nights include rooms temporarily taken out of service.(6)Per room guest spending is used to analyze guest spending at our hotels and is defined as total revenue from room rentals and sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our hotels, divided by total occupied hotel room nights. In the current year, the Company revised its method of allocating revenue on the sales of Disneyland Paris vacation packages between hotel room revenue and admissions revenue. The new method resulted in a decrease in the percentage of revenue allocated to hotel rooms. If we had applied the new method in the prior year, the impact would have been a decrease of approximately $50 million in the prior year.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:($ in millions)20232022% Change Better (Worse)Operating labor$(7,550) $(6,577)(15) %Infrastructure costs(3,127)(2,766)(13) %Cost of goods sold and distribution costs(3,357)(2,938)(14) %Other operating expenses(3,095)(2,655)(17) %$(17,129)$(14,936) (15) %The increase in operating labor was due to inflation, higher volumes and increased costs for new guest offerings.

The increase in average viewership reflected the airing of more cricket matches in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2022 included the ICC T20 World Cup, more Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) matches and the ACC Asia Cup, partially offset by fewer IPL matches compared to fiscal 2021. The ICC T20 World Cup and the ACC Asia Cup were not held in fiscal 2021. The increase in BCCI matches in fiscal 2022 was driven by COVID-19-related cancellations in fiscal 2021. The increase in subscription fees was due to ESPN+ subscriber growth. The increase in other revenue was due to higher sub-licensing fees and higher fees received for programming ESPN on ABC, partially offset by lower UFC pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per event. The increase in sub-licensing fees was due to fees from ICC T20 World Cup matches in fiscal 2022 and higher fees from BCCI cricket matches.The following table presents additional information about ESPN+.(in millions)October 1, 2022October 2, 2021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Paid subscribers at fiscal year end (in millions)24.3 17.1 42 %Average Monthly Revenue per Paid Subscriber for the fiscal year$4.80 $4.57 5 %ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $4.57 to $4.80 primarily due to an increase in retail pricing, a lower mix of annual subscribers and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by a higher mix of subscribers to multi-product offerings.Costs and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:($ in millions)20222021% ChangeBetter (Worse)Programming and production costsESPNDomestic$(10,003) $(9,370) (7) %International(998) (1,094) 9 %(11,001)(10,464)(5) %Star (India)(1,284)(766)(68) %(12,285)(11,230)(9) %Other operating expenses(799)(756)(6) %$(13,084)$(11,986)(9) %The increase in domestic ESPN programming and production costs was due to new NHL programming, higher rights costs for NFL and CFP and an increase in production costs reflecting the return of ESPN-hosted events, which were canceled in fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, and more ESPN films in fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by lower rights costs for MLB and NBA programming. Higher NFL programming costs were due to airing four additional regular season games in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and contractual rate increases. The increase in CFP rights costs was due to higher contractual rates. Lower MLB programming costs were due to airing 29 games of the 2022 regular season under our new contract and one 2021 season playoff game in fiscal 2022 compared to 92 games of the 2021 regular season in fiscal 2021. The decrease in NBA programming costs was due to the comparison to airing four games of the 2020 NBA Finals in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19, partially offset by contractual rate increases. Fiscal 2021 also included the 2021 NBA Finals and fiscal 2022 included the 2022 NBA finals. The decrease in international programming and production costs was due to channel closures in fiscal 2021, the impact of shifting exclusive soccer matches from Sports to Star+ in fiscal 2022 and a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact, partially offset by higher production costs.The increase in Star programming and production costs was due to more cricket matches in fiscal 2022 and higher average costs per match for BCCI and IPL cricket matches.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $210 million, to $1,441 million from $1,231 million, driven by higher marketing costs.55TABLE OF CONTENTSOperating IncomeOperating income increased 1%, to $2,710 million from $2,690 million due to an increase at ESPN, partially offset by a decrease at Star.

Higher attendance reflected increases at Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and, to a lesser extent, Disneyland Paris, partially offset by a decrease at Shanghai Disney Resort. Growth in average per capita ticket revenue was due to the introduction of Genie+ and Lightning Lane at our domestic parks in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and higher average ticket prices at Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris, partially offset by lower average ticket prices at Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort.Growth in resorts and vacations revenue was primarily due to increases of 51% from higher occupied hotel room nights, 32% from an increase in passenger cruise days and 17% from higher average daily hotel room rates. Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth was due to increases of 82% from higher volumes and 9% from higher average guest spending.Merchandise licensing and retail revenue was comparable to the prior year, as a decrease of 8% from retail was offset by an increase of 8% from licensing. The decrease in retail revenues was due to the closure of a substantial number of Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe in the second half of fiscal 2021. The revenue growth at licensing was primarily due to higher sales of merchandise based on Mickey and Friends, Star Wars, Encanto, Spider-Man and Disney Princesses, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from merchandise based on Frozen. The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was primarily due to higher sponsorship revenues and an increase in royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.In addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of our theme parks and resorts, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business: DomesticInternational(1)Total 202220212022202120222021ParksIncrease (decrease)Attendance>100 %(17) %54 %(4) %87 %(14) %Per Capita Guest Spending13 %17 %24 %(3) %18 %11 %HotelsOccupancy82 %42 %56 %21 %76 %37 %Available Room Nights (in thousands)10,07310,4513,1793,17913,25213,630Change in Per Room Guest Spending(1)19 %1 %(7) %22 %15 %4 %(1)In fiscal 2023, the Company revised its method of allocating revenue on the sales of Disneyland Paris vacation packages between hotel room revenue and admissions revenue. The new method resulted in a decrease in the percentage of revenue allocated to hotel rooms. If we had applied the new method in fiscal 2022, the impact would have been a decrease of approximately $50 million. There is no impact to fiscal 2021 due to this change.57TABLE OF CONTENTSCosts and ExpensesOperating expenses are as follows:($ in millions)20222021% Change Better (Worse)Operating labor$(6,577) $(4,711)(40) %Infrastructure costs(2,766)(2,308)(20) %Cost of goods sold and distribution costs(2,938)(2,086)(41) %Other operating expenses(2,655)(1,694)(57) %$(14,936)$(10,799) (38) %The increases in operating labor, cost of goods sold and distribution costs and other operating expenses were due to higher volumes, while the increase in infrastructure costs was due to higher volumes and increased technology spending.Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $517 million from $2,886 million to $3,403 million due to higher marketing spend and inflation.Depreciation and amortization increased $74 million from $2,377 million to $2,451 million, primarily due to new attractions at our domestic parks and resorts.

The decrease in spending on film and episodic content at Entertainment included the impact of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA work stoppages. The increase in operating cash flow at Experiences was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating cash disbursements due to higher operating expenses. The decrease in operating cash flow at Sports was due to the timing of payments for sports content.Cash provided by operating activities of $6.0 billion for fiscal 2022 increased 8% or $436 million compared to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2021 due to higher operating cash flow at Experiences and, to a lesser extent, lower income tax payments and pension contributions, partially offset by lower operating cash flow at Entertainment and, to a lesser extent, a partial payment for the Content License Early Termination. The increase in operating cash flow at Experiences was due to higher operating cash receipts driven by higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating cash disbursements due to higher operating expenses. The decrease in operating cash flow at Entertainment was due to higher operating cash disbursements and higher spending on film and episodic content, partially offset by higher operating cash receipts. Higher operating cash disbursements were driven by increased operating expenses while higher operating cash receipts were due to revenue growth.59TABLE OF CONTENTSDepreciation expense is as follows:($ in millions)202320222021Entertainment$669$560$513Sports7390100ExperiencesDomestic2,0111,6801,551International669662718Total Experiences2,6802,3422,269Corporate204191186Total depreciation expense$3,626$3,183$3,068Amortization of intangible assets is as follows:($ in millions)202320222021Entertainment $87$164$174Sports——4Experiences109109108TFCF and Hulu1,5471,7071,757Total amortization of intangible assets$1,743$1,980$2,043Produced and licensed content costsThe Entertainment and Sports segments incur costs to produce and license film, episodic, sports and other content.

The Company’s investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:($ in millions)202320222021Entertainment$1,032 $802 $838 Sports15 8 24 ExperiencesDomestic2,203 2,680 1,597 International822 767 675 Total Experiences3,025 3,447 2,272 Corporate897 686 444 $4,969 $4,943 $3,578 Capital expenditures at Entertainment primarily reflect investments in technology and in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities. The increase in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was driven by higher technology spending to support our streaming services.Capital expenditures at Experiences are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was due to lower spending on cruise ship fleet expansion. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was due to cruise ship fleet expansion.Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. The increases in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 and in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 were both due to higher spending on facilities.The Company currently expects its fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to total approximately $6 billion compared to fiscal 2023 capital expenditures of $5 billion. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to higher spending at Experiences, in part due to continued investment in our Disney Cruise Line business.Financing ActivitiesFinancing activities for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:($ in millions)202320222021Change in borrowings$(1,783)$(4,017)$(3,699)Activities related to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests(707)(507)(874)Cash used in other financing activities, net(1)(234)(205)188 Cash used in financing activities - continuing operations$(2,724) $(4,729) $(4,385) (1) Primarily consists of equity award activity.61TABLE OF CONTENTSBorrowings activities and otherDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:($ in millions)October 1, 2022BorrowingsPaymentsOtherActivitySeptember 30, 2023Commercial paper with original maturities less than three months(1)$50 $238 $— $1 $289 Commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months1,612 3,603 (4,032) 4 1,187 U.S. dollar denominated notes(2)45,091 — (1,450) (137) 43,504 Asia Theme Parks borrowings(3)1,425 83 (225) 25 1,308 Foreign currency denominated debt and other(4)191 — — (48) 143 $48,369 $3,924 $(5,707) $(155) $46,431 (1)Borrowings and reductions of borrowings are reported net.(2)The other activity is primarily due to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and debt issuance fees.(3)See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding commitments to fund the Asia Theme Parks.(4)The other activity is due to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s bank facilities and debt maturities. The Company may use operating cash flows, commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities and incremental term debt issuances to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.In November 2023, NBCU exercised its put right to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s interest in Hulu for the greater of approximately $9 billion or NBCU’s share of fair value (see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).The Company did not declare or pay a dividend or repurchase any of its shares in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.The Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as continuing to not declare dividends; raising financing; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing furloughs or reductions in force.The Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 30, 2023, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 30, 2023, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content CostsWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).62TABLE OF CONTENTSWith respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.Production costs classified as individual are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Historical viewing patterns are the most significant input into determining the projected usage, and significant judgment is required in using historical viewing patterns to derive projected usage. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value). Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.Revenue RecognitionThe Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our revenue recognition policies.Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial AssumptionsThe Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. We increased our discount rate to 5.94% at the end of fiscal 2023 from 5.44% at the end of fiscal 2022 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our fiscal 2023 year-end measurement date. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2024 by approximately $200 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2023 by approximately $2.0 billion. A one 63TABLE OF CONTENTSpercentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $45 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Our expected return on plan assets is 7.00%. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense. A one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2024 annual expense by approximately $170 million.Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and InvestmentsThe Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.In fiscal 2023, the Company bypassed the qualitative test and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment, under both the previous segment reporting structure and the new segment reporting structure. There were no goodwill impairments under the previous reporting structure. The change in reporting structure requires judgment to identify new reporting units, allocate goodwill to these reporting units (based on relative fair values) and assign other recorded assets and liabilities to these reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Discount rates for each reporting unit are determined based on the inherent risks of each reporting unit’s underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.Since our prior annual impairment assessment performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the fair values of our media and entertainment businesses have generally declined as a result of higher discount rates and lower projections for certain revenue streams.Based on our projections, the carrying amounts of our entertainment and international sports linear networks reporting units exceeded their fair values and we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of approximately $0.7 billion. The entertainment linear networks reporting unit goodwill after impairment is approximately $8 billion and the international sports linear networks reporting unit goodwill is fully impaired.In addition, the fair value of our entertainment DTC services reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by less than 10%. Goodwill of the entertainment DTC services reporting unit is approximately $45 billion.Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Changes to these significant assumptions, market trends, or macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record additional impairment charges. For our entertainment linear networks reporting unit, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 1% reduction in projected cash flows used to determine fair value would result in an incremental impairment charge of approximately $0.3 billion.For our entertainment DTC services reporting unit, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate used to determine fair value would result in an impairment of $0.5 billion, and a 1% reduction in projected cash flows would result in a decrease in the excess fair value over carrying amount by approximately $0.9 billion.To test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair 64TABLE OF CONTENTSvalue. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test. The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows. The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.The Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded. The Company tested its indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $2.3 billion, $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fiscal 2023 charges primarily related to content impairments resulting from a strategic change in our approach to content curation. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The fiscal 2022 charges primarily related to exiting our businesses in Russia. The fiscal 2021 charges primarily related to the closure of an animation studio and a substantial number of our Disney-branded retail stores in North America and Europe.Allowance for Credit LossesWe evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.Contingencies and LitigationWe are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.Income TaxAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to 65TABLE OF CONTENTSsettle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.

(formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at September 30, 2023 was as follows:TWDCLegacy Disney($ in millions)Par ValueCarrying ValuePar ValueCarrying ValueRegistered debt with unconditional guarantee$35,163 $35,393 $8,121 $7,880 The guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.Operations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.Set forth below are summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Results of operations ($ in millions)2023Revenues$— Costs and expenses— Net income (loss) from continuing operations(2,160) Net income (loss)(2,160) Net income (loss) attributable to TWDC shareholders(2,160) 67TABLE OF CONTENTSBalance Sheet ($ in millions)September 30, 2023October 1, 2022Current assets$8,544 $5,665 Noncurrent assets2,927 1,948 Current liabilities5,746 3,741 Noncurrent liabilities (excluding intercompany to non-Guarantors)43,307 46,218 Intercompany payables to non-Guarantors154,018 148,958 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.Policies and ProceduresIn the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in certain countries have reduced and in the future could further reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in, or repatriate cash from, those countries.Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel, oil and gasoline.Our objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Value at Risk (VAR)The Company utilizes a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, commodities and market sensitive equity financial instruments. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. Various modeling techniques can be used in a VAR computation. The Company’s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, commodities and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of VAR amounts at each fiscal quarter end. The model includes all of the Company’s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts, commodities and market sensitive equity investments. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.68TABLE OF CONTENTSThe VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the Company, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.VAR on a combined basis decreased to $284 million at September 30, 2023 from $395 million at October 1, 2022 due to reduced interest rate volatility and lower sensitivity of our debt portfolio to movement of interest rates.The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the VAR model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):Fiscal 2023Interest RateSensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCurrencySensitiveFinancialInstrumentsEquity SensitiveFinancialInstrumentsCommodity Sensitive Financial InstrumentsCombinedPortfolioYear end fiscal 2023 VAR$258$45$4$4$284Average VAR33658134360Highest VAR40376235425Lowest VAR2584544284Year end fiscal 2022 VAR 37671204395The VAR for Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort is immaterial as of September 30, 2023 and has been excluded from the above table.",2023-12-30 17:48:23.812550
