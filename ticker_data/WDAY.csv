1327811,WDAY,"Workday, Inc.",2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.” Overview Workday provides enterprise cloud applications for human capital management (HCM), payroll, financial management, grants management, time tracking, procurement, employee expense management and analytics. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources. We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today – in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates, which we currently provide three times per year, has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our Human Capital Management (HCM) application in 2006. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers, including our Financial Management application in 2007, our Procurement and Employee Expense Management applications in 2008, our Payroll and mobile applications in 2009, our Talent Management application in 2010, and our native iPad application and Workday integration platform in 2011. We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with three year terms and with subscription fees based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications to enterprise customers primarily through our direct sales force. We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes large, global companies and our direct sales force targets organizations with more than 1,000 workers. As of January 31, 2013, we had more than 400 customers. A substantial majority of our growth comes from new customers choosing to use our services and entering into contracts with us. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to our significant growth in employees. We had more than 1,750 and more than 1,050 employees as of January 31, 2013, and January 31, 2012, respectively. We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our application development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations to sell our applications globally. We expect to continue to make significant upfront investments in our data center infrastructure and personnel to service our growth in customers. The level of these upfront infrastructure investments will vary based on the rate at which new customers are added and the scale of such deployments. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are 37 Table of Contents allocating our resources efficiently. As a result of these investments, we do not expect to be profitable in the near future. We expect our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers. Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. More recently, we have expanded our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, including partners building their practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. In addition, over time we expect professional services revenues and the cost of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to decline as we increasingly rely on third parties to deploy our applications and as the number of our existing customers continues to grow. Fiscal Year End We changed our fiscal year end from December 31 to January 31 effective for our fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. For the year-over-year discussions below, the year ended January 31, 2013 is compared to the year ended January 31, 2012, and the year ended January 31, 2012 is compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Components of Results of Operations Revenues We primarily derive our revenues from subscription fees and professional services fees. Subscription revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include routine customer support at no additional cost. Professional service fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training. Subscription revenues accounted for 70% of our revenues during the year ended January 31, 2013 and represented 92% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2013. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the number of applications subscribed to by each customer, the price of our applications, and to a lesser extent, renewal rates. To date, revenues from renewals have not been a substantial component of revenues. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Compared to our other offerings, our HCM application has been available for a longer period of time, is more established in the marketplace and has benefited from continued enhancements of the functionality over a longer period of time, all of which help us to improve our pricing for that application. However, new products or services offerings by competitors in the future could impact the mix and pricing of our offerings. Subscription fees are recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer, which is generally within one week of contract signing. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years and are non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue and are recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period. Amounts that have not been invoiced represent backlog and are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Our consulting engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed. We offer a number of training options intended to support our customers in configuring, using and administering our services. Our typical professional services and training 38 Table of Contents payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As Workday’s professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time. Approximately 9% of our revenues for the year ended January 31, 2013 were derived from multiple-deliverable arrangements that were accounted for as a single unit of accounting, because some of our professional services offerings did not have standalone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contracts. Additionally, in these situations, we defer the direct costs of the related professional services contract and those direct costs are amortized over the same period as the professional services revenues are recognized. As of January 31, 2013, 8% of our total unearned revenue balance represented multiple-deliverable arrangements accounted for as a single unit of accounting. For contracts executed during the current fiscal year, there was standalone value for all deliverables. Costs and Expenses Costs of Revenues. Costs of subscription revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses (including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation) related to hosting our applications and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of owned and leased computer equipment and software. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel costs. The percentage of revenues derived from professional services was 30% in the year ended January 31, 2013. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscriptions. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs and travel related expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. Commissions earned by our sales force that can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract are deferred and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable contract. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statement of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated: Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 (in thousands) Revenues: Subscription services $ 190,320 $ 88,634 $ 36,594 Professional services 83,337 45,793 31,461 Total revenues 273,657 134,427 68,055 Costs and expenses: Costs of revenues: Costs of subscription services 39,251 22,342 11,419 Costs of professional services 77,284 43,026 28,445 Total costs of revenues 116,535 65,368 39,864 Research and development 102,665 62,014 39,175 Sales and marketing 123,440 70,356 36,524 General and administrative 48,880 15,133 8,553 Total costs and expenses 391,520 212,871 124,116 Operating loss (117,863 ) (78,444 ) (56,061 ) Other expense, net (1,203 ) (1,018 ) (57 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (119,066 ) (79,462 ) (56,118 ) Provision for income taxes 124 167 97 Net loss $ (119,190 ) $ (79,629 ) $ (56,215 ) Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 Revenues: Subscription services 69.5 % 65.9 % 53.8 % Professional services 30.5 34.1 46.2 Total revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Costs and expenses: Costs of revenues: Costs of subscription services 14.3 16.6 16.8 Costs of professional services 28.3 32.0 41.8 Total costs of revenues 42.6 48.6 58.6 Research and development 37.5 46.1 57.6 Sales and marketing 45.1 52.3 53.7 General and administrative 17.9 11.3 12.6 Total costs and expenses 143.1 158.4 182.4 Operating loss (43.1 ) (58.4 ) (82.4 ) Other expense, net (0.4 ) (0.8 ) (0.1 ) Loss before provision for income taxes (43.6 ) (59.1 ) (82.5 ) Provision for income taxes 0.0 0.1 0.1 Net loss (43.6 %) (59.2 %) (82.6 %) 40 Table of Contents Revenues Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 2012 to 2013% Change 2010 to 2012% Change (in thousands) Subscription services $ 190,320 $ 88,634 $ 36,594 115 % 142 % Professional services 83,337 45,793 31,461 82 46 Total revenues $ 273,657 $ 134,427 $ 68,055 104 98 Year ended January 31, 2013 compared to Year ended January 31, 2012. Total revenues were $273.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $134.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $139.2 million, or 104%. Subscription services revenues were $190.3 million, or 70% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $88.6 million, or 66% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to the addition of new and larger customer contracts as compared to the prior year. We had more than 400 customers as of January 31, 2013 compared to more than 250 customers as of January 31, 2012. Professional services revenues were $83.3 million, or 30% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $45.8 million, or 34% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to a larger customer base requesting deployment and integration services. Year ended January 31, 2012 compared to Year ended December 31, 2010. Total revenues were $134.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $68.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $66.3 million, or 98%. Subscription services revenues were $88.6 million, or 66% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $36.6 million, or 54% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to the addition of new and larger customers as compared to the prior year. We had more than 250 customers as of January 31, 2012 and more than 150 customers as of December 31, 2010. Professional services revenues were $45.8 million, or 34% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $31.5 million, or 46% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to a larger customer base requesting deployment, integration and training services. Costs and Expenses Costs of Revenues Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 2012 to 2013% Change 2010 to 2012% Change (in thousands) Subscription services $ 39,251 $ 22,342 $ 11,419 76 % 96 % Professional services 77,284 43,026 28,445 80 51 Total costs of revenues $ 116,535 $ 65,368 $ 39,864 78 64 Year ended January 31, 2013 compared to Year ended January 31, 2012. Costs of revenues were $116.5 million for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $65.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $51.2 million or 78%. The increase in costs of subscription services was primarily due to an increase of $6.2 million in employee related costs driven by higher headcount and an increase of $4.8 million in depreciation and amortization expenses for additional data center equipment. In addition, we had an increase of $2.9 million in service delivery costs and $1.5 million in facilities costs due to our efforts to increase data center capacity. The increase in the costs of professional services revenues for the year ended January 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2012 was primarily due to additional costs of $31.6 million to staff our deployment 41 Table of Contents and integration engagements. Due to the large increase in demand for our professional services versus the year ended January 31, 2012, we have increased both our internal professional service staff as well as third party supplemental staff. We expect costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to decline as we increasingly rely on third parties to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. Year ended January 31, 2012 compared to Year ended December 31, 2010. Costs of revenues were $65.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $25.5 million or 64%. The increase in costs of subscription services was primarily due to an increase of $4.7 million in employee related costs driven by higher headcount, an increase of $2.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of $2.4 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity. The increase in the cost of professional services revenues for the year ended January 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to an $11.2 million increase in higher employee related costs driven by higher headcount. Research and Development Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 2012 to 2013% Change 2010 to 2012% Change (in thousands) Research and development $ 102,665 $ 62,014 $ 39,175 66 % 58 % Year ended January 31, 2013 compared to Year ended January 31, 2012. Research and development expenses were $102.7 million, or 38% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $62.0 million, or 46% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $40.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $30.4 million in employee related costs due to higher headcount and a $2.6 million increase in contractor costs as we supplemented our internal development professionals. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies. Year ended January 31, 2012 compared to Year ended December 31, 2010. Research and development expenses were $62.0 million, or 46% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $39.2 million, or 58% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $22.8 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $18.0 million in employee related costs due to higher headcount and an increase of $1.4 million in contractor costs. Sales and Marketing Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 2012 to 2013% Change 2010 to 2012% Change (in thousands) Sales and marketing $ 123,440 $ 70,356 $ 36,524 75 % 93 % Year ended January 31, 2013 compared to Year ended January 31, 2012. Sales and marketing expenses were $123.4 million, or 45% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $70.4 million, or 52% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $53.1 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $37.8 million in employee related costs driven by higher headcount, $5.0 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, and $3.2 million in travel expenses. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to invest in sales and marketing by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and attracting new customers. 42 Table of Contents Year ended January 31, 2012 compared to Year ended December 31, 2010. Sales and marketing expenses were $70.4 million, or 52% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $36.5 million, or 54% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $33.9 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $24.7 million in employee related costs driven by increased headcount, $3.6 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, and $2.5 million in travel expenses. General and Administrative Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 2012 to 2013% Change 2010 to 2012% Change (in thousands) General and administrative $ 48,880 $ 15,133 $ 8,553 223 % 77 % Year ended January 31, 2013 compared to Year ended January 31, 2012. General and administrative expenses were $48.9 million, or 18% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2013, compared to $15.1 million, or 11% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, an increase of $33.7 million. The increase was primarily due to $15.6 million in higher employee related costs driven by higher headcount, of which $5.6 million is related to share-based compensation charges, and a one-time $11.3 million non-cash charge related to the donation of 500,000 shares of common stock to the Workday Foundation in the third quarter. Also contributing to the change was a $4.9 million increase in professional services costs as we transitioned to being a public company. Excluding the charge related to the Workday Foundation stock grant, we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Year ended January 31, 2012 compared to Year ended December 31, 2010. General and administrative expenses were $15.1 million, or 11% of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2012, compared to $8.6 million, or 13% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $6.6 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $2.5 million in employee related costs driven by higher headcount and $2.2 million in professional and outside service costs. The growth in general and administrative expenses during the year ended January 31, 2012 was to support the overall growth of our company. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 31, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $790.3 million, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, money market funds, corporate securities, and certificates of deposit. Since our inception, we financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, customer prepayments and capital lease obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. 43 Table of Contents Our cash flows for the years ended January 31, 2013, January 31, 2012 and December 31, 2010 were as follows (in thousands): Year EndedJanuary 31,2013 Year EndedJanuary 31,2012 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Net cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 11,214 $ (13,774 ) $ (15,335 ) Investing activities (670,118 ) (56,195 ) 12,167 Financing activities 685,537 96,978 (326 ) Effect of exchange rate changes (4 ) 8 9 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 26,629 $ 27,017 $ (3,485 ) Operating Activities For the year ended January 31, 2013, cash flows provided by operating activities was $11.2 million. The positive cash flows resulted primarily from increased cash collections driven by growth in sales to our customers. This increase in collections was largely offset by increases in our operating expenses, which was primarily driven by increased headcount. For the year ended January 31, 2012, cash flows used in operating activities was $13.8 million. The cash used was primarily attributable to increases in our operating expenses, partially offset by the increase in cash collections driven by growth in sales to our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash flows used in operating activities was $15.3 million. The cash used was primarily attributable to increases in our operating expenses, partially offset by the increase in cash collections driven by growth in sales to our customers. Investing Activities Cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended January 31, 2013, January 31, 2012 and December 31, 2010 was $(670.1) million, $(56.2) million, and $12.2 million respectively, and was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and of capital expenditures of $15.9 million, $5.0 million and $3.7 million respectively. Following the initial public offering of our common stock in October 2012, we purchased a significant amount of marketable securities. We expect capital expenditures, some of which may be financed through capital leases, will be approximately $80 million for the year ended January 31, 2014. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. Financing Activities For the year ended January 31, 2013, financing activities provided $685.5 million, primarily as a result of $684.6 million net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in October 2012 and $10.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $9.5 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. For the year ended January 31, 2012, financing activities provided $97.0 million primarily as a result of $95.0 million net proceeds from issuance of the Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock and $6.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $4.3 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. 44 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash flows used in financing activities was $0.3 million, primarily as a result $1.0 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations, partially offset by $0.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Backlog We have generally signed multiple year subscription contracts for our applications. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, unearned revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent they are non-cancelable, they are considered by us to be backlog. The amount of subscription contract backlog was $434 million as of January 31, 2013. We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewal, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Backlog may also vary based on changes in the average non-cancelable term of our subscription agreements. During the year ended January 31, 2013, the quarterly average non-cancelable contract term of our subscription agreements trended down from nearly four years to just over three years in the fiscal fourth quarter. The change in backlog that results from changes in the average non-cancelable term of our subscription arrangements may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenues. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally. Commitments Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment. As of January 31, 2013, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations(1) $ 26,840 $ 13,202 $ 13,638 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 31,760 8,198 15,232 6,684 1,646 Contractual commitments 2,063 2,063 — — — Total $ 60,663 $ 23,463 $ 28,870 $ 6,684 $ 1,646 (1) Includes principal and imputed interest. During the year ended January 31, 2014, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In addition, our existing lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations will change as we enter into additional lease agreements as we expand our operations and renew existing lease agreements. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated 45 Table of Contents with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through January 31, 2013, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenues primarily from subscription fees and from professional services fees, including training. We sell subscriptions to our cloud applications through contracts that are generally three years in length. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. Our subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. We commence revenue recognition for our cloud applications and professional services when all of the following criteria are met: • There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; • The service has been or is being provided to the customer; • Collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and • The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Subscription Revenues Subscription revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services Revenues Professional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or when any milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The 46 Table of Contents majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements For arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting. Revenue for arrangements treated as a single unit of accounting is generally recognized over the period commencing upon delivery of the final deliverable and over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Subscription contracts have standalone value as we sell the subscriptions separately. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription services, we consider the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and whether we sell our applications to new customers without professional services. As of January 31, 2012, we did not have standalone value for the professional services related to the deployment of our financial management application. This was due to the fact that we had historically performed the majority of these services to support our customers’ deployments of this application. In the year ended January 31, 2013, we determined that we had established standalone value for the deployment services related to our financial management application. This was primarily due to the growing number of partners that were trained and certified to perform these deployment services, the successful completion of a significant deployment engagement by a firm in our professional services ecosystem and the sale of several financial management cloud application subscription arrangements to customers without our deployment services. Because we established standalone value for our deployment services related to our financial management application in the year ended January 31, 2013, such service arrangements entered into after February 1, 2012 are being accounted for separately from subscription services. When multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangement accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement fee to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any. We determine our best estimate of selling price for our deliverables based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. We evaluate our best estimate of selling price by reviewing historical data related to sales of our deliverables, including comparing the percentages of our contract prices to our list prices. We also consider several other data points in our evaluation, including the size of our arrangements, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within our arrangements. Deferred Costs Deferred costs include commissions earned by our sales force that can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable cloud application services contract and direct costs related to professional services contracts accounted for together with a related cloud application services contract as a single unit of accounting. 47 Table of Contents Direct sales commissions are deferred when earned and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable cloud application services contract. The commission payments are paid in full after the customer has paid for its first year of service. Direct professional services costs are deferred up until the commencement of revenue recognition of the single unit and then recognized when the related professional services revenues are recognized. We have a limited number of deferred professional services contracts which were consummated prior to the establishment of standalone value for our professional services. Amortization of deferred commissions and deferred professional services costs are included in sales and marketing and costs of professional services, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended January 31, 2013, we deferred $12.8 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $6.5 million to sales and marketing expense. During the year ended January 31, 2012, we deferred $10.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $3.2 million to sales and marketing expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $19.9 million at January 31, 2013, and $13.6 million at January 31, 2012. During the year ended January 31, 2013, we deferred $4.3 million of professional services costs and we amortized $4.8 million to costs of professional services. During the year ended January 31, 2012, we deferred $2.2 million of professional services costs and we amortized $4.1 million to costs of professional services. Deferred professional services costs on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $8.5 million at January 31, 2013 and $9.0 million at January 31, 2012. Share-Based Compensation Compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee, consultant, and non-employee director stock awards, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized using a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally five years. For restricted stock awards, fair value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Our option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. These assumptions are estimated as follows: • Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our initial public offering in October 2012, our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting at which awards were approved. The factors included, but were not limited to: (i) contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock; (ii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our Preferred Stock relative to those of our common stock; (iii) the lack of marketability of our common stock; (iv) our actual operating and financial results; (v) current business conditions and projections; and (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions. Since our initial public offering, we have used the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. 48 Table of Contents • Risk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation model on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term of the options for each option group. • Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We determined the expected term assumption based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual terms of the options. • Volatility. We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical volatilities of our peer group as we do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock. To determine our peer group of companies, we consider public enterprise cloud application providers and select those that are similar to us in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. For valuations prior to May 2012, we used the same group of peer companies. As a result of acquisitions of certain peer group companies, we removed those companies and added additional peer group companies for valuations beginning May 2012. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers’ common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. • Dividend Yield. We have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends. The following table summarizes the assumptions relating to our stock options as follows: Year Ended January 31,2013 January 31,2012 December 31,2010 Expected volatility 54.3% – 61.1% 58.1% – 59.1% 60.6% – 61.2% Expected term (in years) 5 – 6.4 5 – 6.4 5 – 6.4 Risk-free interest rate 0.8% – 1.0% 0.9% – 2.7% 1.0% – 2.9% Dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average grant date fair value per share $10.88 $1.78 $0.61 In addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation for our option awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover, and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income. The standard requires entities to have more detailed reporting of comprehensive income. The guidance is 49 Table of Contents effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied retrospectively. We adopted this new guidance on February 1, 2012. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement. The standard requires entities to change certain measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this new guidance on February 1, 2012. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Due to the relative size of our international operations to date, our foreign currency exposure has been fairly limited and thus we have not instituted a hedging program. We expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we are continually monitoring the foreign currency exposure to determine when we should begin a hedging program. The substantial majority of our agreements have been, and we expect will continue to be, denominated in U.S. dollars. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $790.3 million as of January 31, 2013. This amount was invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, money market funds, corporate securities, and certificates of deposit. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $2.2 million market value reduction as of January 31, 2013. Certain of our investments earn less than 100-basis points and as a result, an immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by less than $0.4 million as of January 31, 2013. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $111.2 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk; however, the risk was not material. 50 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:11.996269

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.” Overview Workday provides enterprise cloud applications for human capital management (HCM), payroll, financial management and analytics. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources. We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today – in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our Human Capital Management (HCM) application in 2006. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers, including our Financial Management application in 2007, our Procurement and Employee Expense Management applications in 2008, our Payroll and mobile applications in 2009, our Talent Management application in 2010, our native iPad application and Workday integration platform in 2011, Time Tracking and Grants Management applications in 2012 and Big Data Analytics in 2013. We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with three-year terms and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications primarily through our direct sales force. We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes large, global companies and our direct sales force targets organizations with more than 1,000 workers. As of January 31, 2014, we had more than 600 customers. A substantial majority of our growth comes from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to our significant growth in employees. We had more than 2,600 and more than 1,700 employees as of January 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our application development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations to sell our applications globally. We have made significant investments in our data center infrastructure in fiscal 2014. We expect to continue this effort in fiscal 2015 as we update our technology and plan for future customer growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growth in customers. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. As a result of these investments, we do not expect to be profitable in the near future. We expect our product 31 Table of Contents development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers. Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. In addition, over time we expect professional services revenues and the cost of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to decline as we increasingly rely on our partners to deploy Workday applications and as the number of our existing customers continues to grow. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the year ended January 31, 2014. Components of Results of Operations Revenues We primarily derive our revenues from subscription services fees and professional services fees. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include routine customer support at no additional cost. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training. Subscription services revenues accounted for over 75% of our total revenues during fiscal 2014 and represented over 90% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2014. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the number of applications subscribed to by each customer, the price of our applications, and to a lesser extent, renewal rates. To date, revenues from renewals have not been a substantial component of revenues. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Compared to our other offerings, our HCM application has been available for a longer period of time, is more established in the marketplace and has benefited from continued enhancements of the functionality over a longer period of time, all of which help us to improve our pricing for that application. However, new products or services offerings by competitors in the future could impact the mix and pricing of our offerings. Subscription services fees are recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer, which is generally within one week of contract signing. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years and are non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. Amounts that have not been invoiced represent backlog and are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Our consulting engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed. We offer a number of training options intended to support our customers in configuring, using and administering our services. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As Workday’s professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms 32 Table of Contents continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time. Approximately 2% of our total revenues for year ended January 31, 2014 were derived from multiple-deliverable arrangements that were accounted for as a single unit of accounting, because some of our professional services offerings did not have standalone value when the related contracts were executed. In these situations, all revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations, we defer the direct costs of the related professional services contract and those direct costs are amortized over the same period as the professional services revenues are recognized. As of January 31, 2014, less than 10% of our total unearned revenue balance represented multiple-deliverable arrangements accounted for as a single unit of accounting. For contracts executed subsequent to February 1, 2012, there was standalone value for all deliverables. Costs and Expenses Costs of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of owned and leased computer equipment and software. Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel costs. The percentage of total revenues derived from professional services was 24% in fiscal 2014. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscriptions. Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs and travel related expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. Commissions earned by our sales force that can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract are deferred and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable contract. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. Results of Operations Revenues Our total revenues for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014% Change 2012 to 2013% Change (in thousands) Subscription services $ 354,169 $ 190,320 $ 88,634 86 % 115 % Professional services 114,769 83,337 45,793 38 82 Total revenues $ 468,938 $ 273,657 $ 134,427 71 104 33 Table of Contents Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Total revenues were $468.9 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $273.7 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $195.2 million, or 71%. Subscription services revenues were $354.2 million for fiscal 2014, or 76% of total revenues, compared to $190.3 million, or 70% of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, an increase of $163.9 million or 86%. The increase in subscription services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers as compared to the prior year period. We had more than 600 customers as of January 31, 2014 compared to more than 400 customers as of January 31, 2013. Professional services revenues were $114.8 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $83.3 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $31.5 million, or 38%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers and a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services. Fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Total revenues were $273.7 million for fiscal 2013, compared to $134.4 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $139.2 million, or 104%. Subscription services revenues were $190.3 million, or 70% of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $88.6 million, or 66% of total revenues, for fiscal 2012. The increase in subscription services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new and larger customer contracts as compared to the prior year. We had more than 400 customers as of January 31, 2013 compared to more than 250 customers as of January 31, 2012. Professional services revenues were $83.3 million, or 30% of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $45.8 million, or 34% of total revenues, for fiscal 2012. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to a larger customer base requesting deployment and integration services. Core Operating Expenses Management uses the non-GAAP financial measure of core operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. Management believes that core operating expenses reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as it excludes expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. Management also believes that core operating expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. The following discussion of our core operating expenses and the components comprising our core operating expenses highlights the factors that our management focuses upon in evaluating our operating margin and operating expenses. The increases or decreases in operating expenses discussed in this section do not include changes relating to share-based compensation, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and an equity grant to the Workday Foundation. Information about our operating expenses is as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2014 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands) Costs of subscription services $ 66,770 $ 2,408 $ 17 $ 69,195 Costs of professional services 102,141 4,818 656 107,615 Product development 158,928 21,644 1,544 182,116 Sales and marketing 184,359 12,131 883 197,373 General and administrative 43,773 20,850 1,298 65,921 Total operating expenses $ 555,971 $ 61,851 $ 4,398 $ 622,220 Operating loss $ (87,033 ) $ (61,851 ) $ (4,398 ) $ (153,282 ) Operating margin (19 )% (13 )% (1 )% (33 )% 34 Table of Contents Year Ended January 31, 2013 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands) Costs of subscription services $ 38,650 $ 601 $ — $ 39,251 Costs of professional services 75,972 1,312 — 77,284 Product development 99,137 3,528 — 102,665 Sales and marketing 120,723 2,717 — 123,440 General and administrative 30,460 7,170 11,250 48,880 Total operating expenses $ 364,942 $ 15,328 $ 11,250 $ 391,520 Operating loss $ (91,285 ) $ (15,328 ) $ (11,250 ) $ (117,863 ) Operating margin (33 )% (6 )% (4 )% (43 )% Year Ended January 31, 2012 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands) Costs of subscription services $ 22,112 $ 230 $ 22,342 Costs of professional services 42,628 398 43,026 Product development 60,890 1,124 62,014 Sales and marketing 69,517 839 70,356 General and administrative 13,542 1,591 15,133 Total operating expenses $ 208,689 $ 4,182 $ 212,871 Operating loss $ (74,262 ) $ (4,182 ) $ (78,444 ) Operating margin (55 )% (3 )% (58 )% (1) Core operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes share-based compensation and certain other operating expenses from our total operating expenses calculated in accordance with GAAP. The other operating expenses excluded are employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions and an equity grant to the Workday Foundation. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information. Core operating margin Core operating margins, calculated using GAAP revenues and core operating expenses, improved from (33)% for fiscal 2013 to (19)% for fiscal 2014 and from (55)% for fiscal 2012 to (33)% for fiscal 2013. The improvement in our operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 compared to prior fiscal years. In evaluating our results, we generally focus on core operating expenses. We believe that our core operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Our core operating expenses are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure, “total operating expenses,” in the table above. Core operating expenses increased by $191.0 million, or 52% for fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013 and by $156.3 million or 75% for fiscal 2013, compared to fiscal 2012. As quantified below, these increases for both periods were primarily due to higher employee-related costs driven by higher headcount. Cost of subscription services Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $66.8 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $38.7 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $28.1 million, or 73%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10.4 million in depreciation expense related to our data 35 Table of Contents centers, an increase of $8.8 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and an increase of $6.6 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity. We expect that in the future, core operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our data center capacity and operations. Fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Core operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $38.7 million for fiscal 2013, compared to $22.1 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $16.6 million, or 75%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.8 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and an increase of $4.8 million in depreciation expenses for additional data center equipment. In addition, we had an increase of $2.9 million in service delivery costs and an increase of $1.5 million in facilities costs due to our increased data center capacity. Cost of professional services Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in costs of professional services were $102.1 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $76.0 million for fiscal 2013, a $26.1 million increase, or 34%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $21.3 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $1.6 million in facility and IT-related expense. Due to the large increase in demand for our professional services versus the prior year, we have increased both our internal professional service staff as well as third-party supplemental staff. Over time, we expect costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to decline as we increasingly rely on third parties to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. For fiscal 2015, we anticipate professional services margins to be lower than fiscal 2014 as we invest in deploying new customers in financial management applications, medium-size enterprise, and education and government categories, where the third party partner ecosystem is still maturing. Fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Core operating expenses in costs of professional services were $76.0 million for fiscal 2013, compared to $42.6 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $33.4 million, or 78%. The increase was primarily due to additional costs of $30.7 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements. Due to the large increase in demand for our professional services versus fiscal 2012, we increased both our internal professional service staff as well as third party supplemental staff. Product development Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in product development were $158.9 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $99.1 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $59.8 million, or 60%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $44.9 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $6.4 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $3.8 million in contracted costs for our development cloud data center. We expect that in the future, product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies. Fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Core operating expenses in product development were $99.1 million for fiscal 2013, compared to $60.9 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $38.2 million, or 63%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $28.0 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and a $2.6 million increase in contractor costs as we supplemented our internal development professionals. Sales and marketing Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in sales and marketing were $184.4 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $120.7 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $63.7 million, or 53%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $47.2 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $5.9 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $4.2 million in travel expenses and $4.2 million in facility and IT-related expenses. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to invest in sales and marketing by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and attracting new customers. 36 Table of Contents Fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Core operating expenses in sales and marketing were $120.7 million for fiscal 2013, compared to $69.5 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $51.2 million, or 74%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $35.9 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $5.0 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, and $3.2 million in travel expenses. General and administrative Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in general and administrative were $43.8 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $30.5 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $13.3 million, or 44%. The increase was primarily due to $10.6 million in higher compensation costs due to higher headcount and $2.1 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal and audit. We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and incur additional employee-related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Core operating expenses in general and administrative were $30.5 million for fiscal 2013, compared to $13.5 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $17.0 million, or 126%. The increase was primarily due to $10.0 million in higher employee-related costs driven by higher headcount. Also contributing to the change was a $4.9 million increase in professional services costs as we transitioned to being a public company. Share-Based Compensation Expenses Share-based compensation expenses were $61.9 million, $15.3 million and $4.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to grants of restricted stock units to existing and new employees during fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we realized $0.3 million excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation expenses. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to equity grants in fiscal 2013 when the market value of our common stock was significantly higher than when the fiscal 2012 grants were made. Many of the fiscal 2014 grants occurred in August 2014 and thus we expect share-based compensation expenses in fiscal 2015 to increase as we will have a full year of expense recognition related to these grants and we expect to make additional share grants in fiscal 2015. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions for fiscal 2014 and a one-time charge related to our contribution of 500,000 shares of common stock to the Workday Foundation in fiscal 2013, were $4.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively. Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions substantially increased beginning in April 2013 after the expiration of the lock-up period instituted for our initial public offering. Before fiscal 2014, the employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions was not included in other operating expenses as it was not material. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net, was $17.5 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $1.2 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $16.3 million. The increase was primarily due to the interest expense related to our 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018 (2018 Notes) and 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020 (2020 Notes, and together with the 2018 Notes, referred to as Notes), including the contractual cash interest expense of $4.0 million and non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs of $14.4 million. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of January 31, 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. corporate securities. We have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, customer payments, and issuance of debt. In July 2013, we issued Notes which provided us with net proceeds of $584.3 million. In January 2014, we sold 6.9 million shares of our Class A common stock in a follow-on offering which provided us with net proceeds of $592.2 million. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. Our cash flows for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 46,263 $ 11,214 $ (13,774 ) Investing activities (682,633 ) (670,118 ) (56,195 ) Financing activities 1,133,610 685,537 96,978 Effect of exchange rate changes (72 ) (4 ) 8 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 497,168 $ 26,629 $ 27,017 In evaluating our performance internally, we focus on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. We define free cash flows, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and purchase of other intangible assets. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information. Our free cash flows for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,263 $ 11,214 $ (13,774 ) Purchases of property and equipment (60,725 ) (15,898 ) (4,999 ) Property and equipment acquired under capital leases (115 ) (18,717 ) (15,983 ) Purchase of other intangible assets (15,000 ) — — Free cash flows $ (29,577 ) $ (23,401 ) $ (34,756 ) Operating Activities Management uses cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a key financial matric. For fiscal 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $46.3 million as compared to $11.2 million for fiscal 2013 and a use of cash in operating activities of $13.8 million for fiscal 2012. The increase in cash flows compared to prior fiscal years resulted primarily from increased cash collections driven by growth in sales to our customers. This increase in collections in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 was partially offset by increases in our operating expenses, which was primarily driven by increased headcount. 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $682.6 million, $670.1 million and $56.2 million respectively, and was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and of capital expenditures of $60.7 million, $15.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Following the initial public offering of our Class A common stock in October 2012, the issuance of our Notes in July 2013 and our follow-on offering of Class A common stock in January 2014, we purchased a significant amount of marketable securities. In addition, during fiscal 2014, we paid $10.0 million to purchase a leasehold interest and $5.0 million to acquire patents. We expect capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million for fiscal 2015. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. Financing Activities For fiscal 2014, financing activities provided $1.1 billion, primarily as a result of $584.3 million in net proceeds from issuance of the Notes, $592.2 million in net proceeds from our follow-on offering of Class A common stock, $92.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of warrants related to the Notes and $23.7 million in proceeds from issuance of our Class A common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). These proceeds were partially offset by $143.7 million to purchase convertible senior notes hedges and $12.1 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. We purchased the convertible senior notes hedges to offset potential economic dilution to our Class A Common Stock upon any conversion of the Notes. For fiscal 2013, financing activities provided $685.5 million, primarily as a result of $684.6 million of net proceeds from our initial public offering of Class A common stock in October 2012 and $10.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $9.5 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. For fiscal 2012, financing activities provided $97.0 million primarily as a result of $95.0 million of net proceeds from issuance of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock and $6.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $4.3 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. Free Cash Flows In addition to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, management uses free cash flows as a key financial matric. Free cash flows decreased by $6.2 million to $(29.6) million for fiscal 2014, compared to $(23.4) million for fiscal 2013, and improved by $11.4 million to $(23.4) million for fiscal 2013, compared to $(34.8) million for fiscal 2012. The reduction in free cash flows in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a significant increase in cash paid for property and equipment and payments made for a leasehold interest and patents, partially offset by increased sales and the related cash collections. The increase in free cash flows in 2013 was primarily due to increased sales and the related cash collections. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Core Operating Expenses We define core operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in 39 Table of Contents understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. • Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. For restricted share awards, the amount of share-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Moreover, determining the fair value of certain of the share-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards. Unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is an element of our ongoing share-based compensation expenses, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control. • Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses included employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions for fiscal 2014 and a one-time charge related to our contribution of equity to the Workday Foundation for fiscal 2013. The amount of employer payroll taxes on share-based compensation is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. During fiscal 2013, Workday granted 500,000 shares of common stock to the Workday Foundation. The Workday Foundation is a non-profit organization established to provide grants and humanitarian relief, employer matching contributions and to support volunteerism and social development projects. This grant resulted in a one-time charge of $11.3 million, which was recorded to the General and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of operations. Management does not expect to make future grants of shares to the Foundation and therefore considers this charge non-recurring. As such, management believes it is useful to exclude this one-time charge in order to better understand the ongoing expenses of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results across periods. Free cash flows We define free cash flows as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and purchase of other intangible assets. Management uses free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business, as it balances operating results, cash management and capital efficiency. When calculating free cash flows, we subtract the gross value of all equipment, even when acquired under capital leases, so we can evaluate our progress on free cash flows independent of our capital financing decisions. Management believes information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, to fund ongoing operations and to fund other capital expenditures. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of core operating expenses and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of core operating expenses and free cash flows should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. Further, the non-GAAP measure of core operating 40 Table of Contents expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP measure of total operating expenses. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling core operating expenses to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and reviewing these measures in conjunction with GAAP financial information. Management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. See “Results of Operations—Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of core operating expenses to the most comparable GAAP measure, “total operating expenses,” for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a reconciliation of free cash flows to the most comparable GAAP measure, “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Backlog We generally sign multiple-year subscription contracts for our applications. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and varies among our subscription contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, unearned revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent future invoicing is considered certain, we consider the contract to be non-cancelable backlog. Future invoicing is considered certain when we have a fully executed non-cancelable contract, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as customer funding or the delivery of a product. The amount of subscription contract backlog was $636.1 million as of January 31, 2014. We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Backlog may also vary based on changes in the average non-cancelable term of our subscription agreements. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of January 31, 2014: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018(1) $ 350,000 $ — $ — $ 350,000 $ — 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020(1) 250,000 — — — 250,000 Aggregate interest obligation(2) 35,904 6,375 12,750 11,321 5,458 Capital lease obligations(3) 13,574 9,901 3,673 — — Operating lease obligations: Facilities space(4) 59,109 12,894 13,578 7,554 25,083 Facilities space with related party 22,414 2,179 4,668 4,890 10,677 Contractual commitments 4,358 4,358 — — — Total $ 735,359 $ 35,707 $ 34,669 $ 373,765 $ 291,218 (1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts. 41 Table of Contents (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash. (3) Includes principal and imputed interest. (4) For the 95-year lease we entered in January 2013, the cash obligations exclude the potential annual rental increases based on the increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). (See more information under “commitments” below). We expect to make higher rent payments over the lease term due to increases in the CPI. Commitments Our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment. For fiscal 2015, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In January 2014, Workday acquired a 95-year lease for a 6.9 acre parcel of land adjacent to our existing Pleasanton, California leased facilities. The lease affords us the opportunity to develop office space for employees in Pleasanton, California. We paid $10.0 million to acquire the lease and $1.5 million in prepaid rent through December 31, 2020. If construction does not commence by June 30, 2015, we will be required to make additional payments to the lessor, ranging from $0.2 million to $1.0 million based on the length of the delay. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In addition, future obligations relating to the lease described above for construction costs and required extension payments, if any, are not included in the above table because the costs and payments are dependent on the timing and scope of construction, which is not yet known. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through January 31, 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees and from professional services fees, including training. We sell subscriptions to our cloud applications through contracts that are generally three years 42 Table of Contents in length. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. Our subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. We commence revenue recognition for our cloud applications and professional services when all of the following criteria are met: • There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; • The service has been or is being provided to the customer; • Collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and • The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Subscription Services Revenues Subscription services revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services Revenues Professional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements For arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting. Revenue for arrangements treated as a single unit of accounting is generally recognized over the period commencing upon delivery of the final deliverable and over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Subscription contracts have standalone value as we sell the subscriptions separately. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription services, we consider the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and whether we sell our applications to new customers without professional services. As of January 31, 2012, we did not have standalone value for the professional services related to the deployment of our financial management application. This was due to the fact that we had historically performed the majority of these services to support our customers’ deployments of this application. In fiscal 2013, we determined that we had established standalone value for the deployment services related to our financial management application. This was primarily due to the growing number of partners that were trained and certified to perform these deployment services, the successful completion of a significant deployment engagement by a firm in our professional services ecosystem and the sale of several financial management cloud application subscription arrangements to customers without our deployment services. Because we established standalone value for our deployment services related to our financial management application in fiscal 2013, such service arrangements entered into after February 1, 2012 are being accounted for separately from subscription services. 43 Table of Contents When multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangement accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement fee to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any. We determine our best estimate of selling price for our deliverables based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. We evaluate our best estimate of selling price by reviewing historical data related to sales of our deliverables, including comparing the percentages of our contract prices to our list prices. We also consider several other data points in our evaluation, including the size of our arrangements, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within our arrangements. Deferred Commissions Direct sales commissions are deferred when earned and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable cloud application services contract. The commission payments are paid in full after the customer has paid for its first year of service. During fiscal 2014, we deferred $19.4 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $10.0 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2013, we deferred $12.8 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $6.5 million to sales and marketing expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $29.3 million and $19.9 million at January 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Convertible Senior Notes In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized to expense over the respective terms of the Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid-in capital. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The standard requires entities to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements or footnotes. The guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012. We adopted this new guidance on February 1, 2013 and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Due to the relative size of our international operations to date and the fact that the majority of our international contracts are currently in U.S. dollars, our foreign currency exposure has been fairly limited. We expect our international operations to continue to grow in the near term and we expect to begin a hedging program in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015 and beyond, we expect the percentage of contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollars to increase. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion as of January 31, 2014. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, money market funds, and corporate securities. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our marketable securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in an $8.5 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2014. All of our investments earn less than 100-basis points and as a result, an immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $1.4 million as of January 31, 2014. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $790.3 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk; however, the risk was not material. 45 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:08.552289
1327811,WDAY,"Workday, Inc.",2015,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.”OverviewWorkday provides financial management, human capital management, and analytics applications designed for the world's largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources.We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today – in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our Human Capital Management (HCM) application in 2006. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers, including our Financial Management application in 2007, our Procurement and Employee Expense Management applications in 2008, our Payroll and mobile applications in 2009, our Talent Management application in 2010, our native iPad application and Workday integration platform in 2011, our Time Tracking and Grants Management applications in 2012, Big Data Analytics in 2013, Recruiting in 2014 and Insight Applications in 2015.We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with three-year terms and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications primarily through our direct sales force.We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes large, global companies and our direct sales force generally targets organizations with more than 1,000 workers. A substantial majority of our growth comes from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to our significant growth in employees. We had approximately 3,750 and approximately 2,600 employees as of January 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our application development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations to sell our applications globally. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center infrastructure in fiscal 2016 as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. In addition, over time we expect professional services revenues and the cost of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to decline as we increasingly rely on our partners to deploy Workday applications and as the number of our existing customers continues to grow.27Table of ContentsFiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2015, for example, refer to the year ended January 31, 2015.Components of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe primarily derive our revenues from subscription services fees and professional services fees. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include routine customer support at no additional cost. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenues accounted for over 78% of our total revenues during fiscal 2015 and represented over 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2015. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the number of applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Compared to our other offerings, our HCM application has been available for a longer period of time, is more established in the marketplace and has benefited from continued enhancements of the functionality over a longer period of time, all of which help us to improve our pricing for that application. However, new products or services offerings by competitors in the future could impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services fees are recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer, which is generally within one week of contract signing. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years and are non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. Amounts that have not been invoiced represent backlog and are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.The majority of our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed. We offer a number of training options intended to support our customers in configuring, using and administering our services. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As Workday’s professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing customer support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of owned and leased computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel. The percentage of total revenues derived from professional services was 22% in fiscal 2015. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscription services.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs and travel. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. Commissions earned by our sales force that can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract are deferred and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable contract.28Table of ContentsGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.Results of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015% Change 2013 to 2014% Change (in thousands) Subscription services$613,328 $354,169 $190,320 73% 86%Professional services174,532 114,769 83,337 52 38Total revenues$787,860 $468,938 $273,657 68 71Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Total revenues were $788 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $469 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $319 million, or 68%. Subscription services revenues were $613 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $354 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $259 million, or 73%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year period. Professional services revenues were $175 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $115 million for the prior year period, an increase of $60 million, or 52%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Total revenues were $469 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $274 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $195 million, or 71%. Subscription services revenues were $354 million for fiscal 2014, or 76% of total revenues, compared to $190 million, or 70% of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, an increase of $164 million or 86%. The increase in subscription services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers as compared to the prior year period. Professional services revenues were $115 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $83 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $32 million, or 38%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers and a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services.Core Operating ExpensesWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of core operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. We believe that core operating expenses reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as it excludes expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that core operating expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.The following discussion of our core operating expenses and the components comprising our core operating expenses highlights the factors that we focus upon in evaluating our operating margin and operating expenses. The increases or decreases in operating expenses discussed in this section do not include changes relating to share-based compensation, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and an equity grant to the Workday Foundation.Reconciliations of our core operating expenses to the nearest GAAP measure, total operating expenses, are as follows:29Table of Contents Year Ended January 31, 2015 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands)Costs of subscription services$96,219 $6,053 $204 $102,476Costs of professional services148,986 12,890 451 162,327Product development249,709 63,938 3,221 316,868Sales and marketing284,545 29,875 1,420 315,840General and administrative61,557 43,292 1,202 106,051Total $841,016 $156,048 $6,498 $1,003,562Operating loss(53,156) $(156,048) $(6,498) $(215,702)Operating margin(7)% (20)% —% (27)% Year Ended January 31, 2014 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands)Costs of subscription services$66,770 $2,408 $17 $69,195Costs of professional services102,141 4,818 656 $107,615Product development158,928 21,644 1,544 $182,116Sales and marketing184,359 12,131 883 $197,373General and administrative43,773 20,850 1,298 $65,921Total $555,971 $61,851 $4,398 $622,220Operating loss$(87,033) $(61,851) $(4,398) $(153,282)Operating margin(19)% (13)% (1)% (33)% Year Ended January 31, 2013 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands)Costs of subscription services$38,650 $601 $— $39,251Costs of professional services75,972 1,312 — $77,284Product development99,137 3,528 — $102,665Sales and marketing120,723 2,717 — $123,440General and administrative30,460 7,170 11,250 $48,880Total $364,942 $15,328 $11,250 $391,520Operating loss$(91,285) $(15,328) $(11,250) $(117,863)Operating margin(33)% (6)% (4)% (43)% (1)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.30Table of ContentsCore operating marginCore operating margins, calculated using GAAP revenues and core operating expenses, improved from (19)% for fiscal 2014 to (7)% for fiscal 2015 and from (33)% for fiscal 2013 to (19)% for fiscal 2014. The improvement in our operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 compared to prior fiscal years. The improvement in fiscal 2015 was also due to higher professional services revenues driven by improved utilization rates and increased demand for services, and improvements to operating leverage. In evaluating our results, we generally focus on core operating expenses. We believe that our core operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Our core operating expenses are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure, “total operating expenses,” in the table above.Core operating expenses increased by $285 million, or 51% for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and by $191 million, or 52% for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. As quantified below, these increases for both periods were primarily due to higher employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.Costs of subscription servicesFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $96 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $67 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $29 million, or 43%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, an increase of $9 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, an increase of $6 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity, and an increase of $3 million in facility and IT-related expense.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $67 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $39 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $28 million, or 72%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $10 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, an increase of $9 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and an increase of $7 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity. We expect that core operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our data center capacity and operations.Costs of professional servicesFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in costs of professional services were $149 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $102 million for fiscal 2014, a $47 million increase, or 46%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $36 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $4 million in facility and IT-related expenses. Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in costs of professional services were $102 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $76 million for fiscal 2013, a $26 million increase, or 34%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $21 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $2 million in facility and IT-related expense. Due to the large increase in demand for our professional services versus the prior year, we have increased both our internal professional service staff as well as third-party supplemental staff. Over time, we expect costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we increasingly rely on third parties to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. For fiscal 2016, we anticipate professional services margins to be lower than fiscal 2015 as we invest in deploying our financial management applications, and in building our partnership ecosystem in the education and government sectors, as well as internationally.Product developmentFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in product development were $250 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $159 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $91 million, or 57%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $66 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $9 million in facility and IT-related expenses, $6 million in depreciation expense for our development cloud data center and $5 million in third party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in product development were $159 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $99 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $60 million, or 61%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $45 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $4 million in contracted costs for our development cloud data center. 31Table of ContentsWe expect that product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and marketingFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in sales and marketing were $285 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $184 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $101 million, or 55%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $68 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $17 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $7 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $6 million in travel.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in sales and marketing were $184 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $121 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $63 million, or 52%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $47 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $6 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $4 million in travel and $4 million in facility and IT-related expenses. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the expansion of our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to build brand awareness and attract new customers.General and administrativeFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in general and administrative were $62 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $44 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $18 million, or 41%. The increase was primarily due to $12 million in higher employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $4 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal and audit and $2 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Core operating expenses in general and administrative were $44 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $30 million for fiscal 2013, an increase of $14 million, or 47%. The increase was primarily due to $11 million in higher compensation costs due to higher headcount and $2 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal and audit. We expect general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.Share-Based Compensation ExpensesShare-based compensation expenses were $156 million, $62 million and $15 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees, as well as a change in the timing of the cycle in which we grant additional equity awards to existing employees which resulted in grants that were made earlier in the fiscal year in fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees during fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the realized excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation were immaterial. The next grant to existing employees is planned for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Other Operating ExpensesOther operating expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions for fiscal 2015 and 2014, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for fiscal 2015 and a one-time charge related to our contribution of 500,000 shares of Class A common stock to the Workday Foundation in fiscal 2013, were $6 million, $4 million and $11 million, respectively. Employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions substantially increased beginning in April 2013 after the expiration of the lock-up period for our initial public offering. Before fiscal 2014, the employer payroll tax-related charges on employee stock transactions were not included in other operating expenses as they were not material.Other Expense, NetOther expense, net, was $30 million, $18 million and $1 million for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in other expense, net for fiscal 2015 and 2014 compared to prior periods was primarily due to the interest expense related to our June 2013 issuance of 0.75% convertible senior notes due October 15, 2018 (2018 Notes) and 1.50% convertible senior notes due October 15, 2020 (2020 Notes, and together with the 2018 Notes, the Notes), as we incurred a full period of interest expense in fiscal 2015.We issued the Notes in June 2013, and therefore incurred interest on the Notes for only a portion of fiscal 2014. We did not incur interest expense for the Notes in fiscal 2013 as they had not yet been issued. The contractual cash interest expense 32Table of Contentswas $6 million and $4 million, respectively, for fiscal 2015 and 2014. The non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs was $24 million and $14 million, respectively, for fiscal 2015 and 2014.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. corporate securities, commercial paper, and money market funds.We have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, customer payments, and issuance of debt. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing.Our cash flows for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$102,003 $46,263 $11,214Investing activities(404,167) (682,633) (670,118)Financing activities19,455 1,133,610 685,537Effect of exchange rate changes(425) (72) (4)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(283,134) $497,168 $26,629In evaluating our performance internally, we focus on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. We define free cash flows, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Our free cash flows for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities$102,003 $46,263 $11,214Purchases of property and equipment(103,646) (60,725) (15,898)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases— (115) (18,717)Purchase of other intangible assets— (15,000) —Free cash flows$(1,643) $(29,577) $(23,401)Operating ActivitiesWe use cash provided by operating activities as a key financial metric. Cash provided by operating activities was $102 million, $46 million and $11 million, respectively, for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. The increase in cash flows compared to prior fiscal years resulted primarily from increased cash collections driven by growth in customer demand for our services. This increase in collections in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 was partially offset by increases in our headcount related and other operational expenses. 33Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $404 million, $683 million and $670 million respectively, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures of $104 million, $61 million and $16 million, respectively. Following the initial public offering of our Class A common stock in October 2012, the issuance of our Notes in June 2013 and our follow-on offering of Class A common stock in January 2014, we purchased a significant amount of marketable securities. In addition, during fiscal 2015, we paid $10 million to purchase 1.4 million shares of series D preferred stock in a private company, and received proceeds of $53 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities. During fiscal 2014, we paid $10 million to purchase a leasehold interest in land in Pleasanton adjacent to our existing office space and $5 million to acquire patents. We expect capital expenditures will be approximately $150 million for fiscal 2016. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. We are actively evaluating construction alternatives for the leasehold land in Pleasanton and have not yet factored related development costs, if any, into our expected capital expenditures.Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $19 million, primarily as a result of $36 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by $10 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations and $8 million of Class A common share repurchases for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock.For fiscal 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $1 billion, primarily as a result of $584 million in net proceeds from issuance of the Notes, $592 million in net proceeds from our follow-on offering of Class A common stock, $93 million in proceeds from the issuance of warrants related to the Notes and $24 million in proceeds from employee equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by $144 million to purchase convertible senior notes hedges and $12 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. We purchased the convertible senior notes hedges to offset potential economic dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Notes.For fiscal 2013, financing activities provided $686 million, primarily as a result of $685 million of net proceeds from our initial public offering of Class A common stock in October 2012 and $10 million in proceeds from employee equity plans, partially offset by $9 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations.Free Cash FlowsIn addition to cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flows as a key financial metric. Free cash flows increased by $28 million to $(2) million for fiscal 2015, compared to $(30) million for fiscal 2014 and decreased by $7 million to $(30) million for fiscal 2014, compared to $(23) million for fiscal 2013. The improvement in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increased sales and related cash collections, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and higher operating expenses, driven primarily by increased headcount. The reduction in free cash flows in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a significant increase in cash paid for property and equipment and payments made for a leasehold interest and patents, partially offset by increased sales and related cash collections. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Core Operating ExpensesWe define core operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. •Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, we believe it is useful to exclude share-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. For restricted share awards, the amount of share-based compensation expenses 34Table of Contentsis not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Moreover, determining the fair value of certain of the share-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards. Unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options and shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is an element of our ongoing share-based compensation expenses, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control.•Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses included employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions for fiscal 2015, and 2014, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for fiscal 2015 and a one-time charge related to our contribution of equity to the Workday Foundation for fiscal 2013. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on share-based compensation is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations. During fiscal 2013, Workday granted 500,000 shares of common stock to the Workday Foundation. The Workday Foundation is a non-profit organization established to provide grants and humanitarian relief, employer matching contributions and to support volunteerism and social development projects. This grant resulted in a one-time charge of $11 million, which was recorded to the General and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of operations. We do not expect to make future grants of shares to the Workday Foundation and therefore consider this charge as non-recurring. As such, we believe it is useful to exclude this one-time charge in order to better understand the ongoing expenses of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results across periods.Free cash flowsWe define free cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets. We use free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business, as it balances operating results, cash management and capital efficiency. When calculating free cash flows, we subtract the gross value of all equipment acquired in the period, even when acquired under capital leases, so that we can evaluate our progress on free cash flows independent of our capital financing decisions. We believe information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, to fund ongoing operations and to fund other capital expenditures.Limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other peer companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. Further, the non-GAAP measure of core operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP measure of total operating expenses.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling core operating expenses to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and reviewing these measures in conjunction with GAAP financial information. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See “Results of Operations—Core Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of core operating expenses to the most comparable GAAP measure, “total operating expenses,” for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a reconciliation of free cash flows to the most comparable GAAP measure, “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.35Table of ContentsBacklogWe generally sign multiple-year subscription contracts for our applications. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and varies among our subscription contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, unearned revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider those future subscription invoices to be non-cancelable backlog. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have a fully executed non-cancelable contract and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as customer funding or the delivery of a product. The amount of non-cancelable subscription contract backlog was $965 million as of January 31, 2015.We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Backlog may also vary based on changes in the average non-cancelable term of our subscription agreements. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2015: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018(1)$350,000 $— $— $350,000 $—1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020(1)250,000 — — — 250,000Aggregate interest obligation(2)29,529 6,375 12,750 8,696 1,708Capital lease obligations(3)3,293 3,293 — — —Operating lease obligations: Facilities space(4)119,271 16,684 44,004 24,779 33,804Facilities space with related party50,990 4,868 10,969 11,455 23,698Contractual commitments6,896 6,896 — — —Total$809,979 $38,116 $67,723 $394,930 $309,210 (1)Represents aggregate principal amount of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts.(2)Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash.(3)Includes principal and imputed interest.(4)For the 95-year lease we entered in January 2013, the cash obligations exclude the potential annual rental increases based on the increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). (See more information under “commitments” below). We expect to make higher rent payments over the lease term due to increases in the CPI.CommitmentsOur principal commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment. For fiscal 2016, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth.In January 2014, Workday acquired a 95-year lease for a 6.9 acre parcel of land adjacent to our existing Pleasanton, California leased facilities. The lease affords us the opportunity to develop office space for employees in Pleasanton, California. We paid $10 million to acquire the lease and $2 million in prepaid rent through December 31, 2020. If construction does not commence by June 30, 2015, we will be required to make additional payments to the lessor, ranging from $0.2 million to $1 million based on the length of the delay.36Table of ContentsPurchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In addition, future obligations relating to the lease described above for construction costs and required extension payments, if any, are not included in the above table because the costs and payments are dependent on the timing and scope of construction, which is not yet known.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees and from professional services fees, including training. We sell subscriptions to our cloud applications through contracts that are generally three years in length. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. Our subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts.We commence revenue recognition for our cloud applications and professional services when all of the following criteria are met: •There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been or is being provided to the customer;•Collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Subscription Services RevenuesSubscription services revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable 37Table of Contentsseparately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered. If one or more of the deliverables does not have standalone value upon delivery, the deliverables that do not have standalone value are generally combined with the final deliverable within the arrangement and treated as a single unit of accounting. Revenue for arrangements treated as a single unit of accounting is generally recognized over the period commencing upon delivery of the final deliverable and over the remaining term of the subscription contract.Subscription contracts have standalone value as we sell the subscriptions separately. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription services, we consider the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and whether we sell our applications to new customers without professional services. All of our professional services have standalone value as of February 1, 2012. When multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangement accounting guidance provides a hierarchy to use when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement fee to the separate units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.We determine our best estimate of selling price for our deliverables based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. We evaluate our best estimate of selling price by reviewing historical data related to sales of our deliverables, including comparing the percentages of our contract prices to our list prices. We also consider several other data points in our evaluation, including the size of our arrangements, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within our arrangements.Deferred CommissionsDirect sales commissions are deferred when earned and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable cloud application services contract. The commission payments are paid in full after the customer has paid for its first year of service. During fiscal 2015, we deferred $23 million of commissions and we amortized $16 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2014, we deferred $19 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $10 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $37 million and $29 million at January 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Convertible Senior NotesIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized to expense over the respective terms of the Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid-in capital.Recent Accounting PronouncementsOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-9 regarding ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The standard provides principles for recognizing revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers with the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal year beginning February 1, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the accounting, transition and disclosure requirements of the standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption.38Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskForeign currency exchange riskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Due to the relative size of our international operations to date and the fact that the majority of our international contracts are currently in U.S. dollars, our foreign currency exposure has been fairly limited. We anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase over time, and we initiated a limited hedging program focused on certain currencies in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 and beyond, we expect the number of contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollars to increase.Interest rate sensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion as of January 31, 2015. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. corporate securities, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our marketable securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $2 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2015. All of our investments earn less than 100-basis points and as a result, an immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $2 million as of January 31, 2015. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk; however, the risk was not material.39Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:12.463888

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.”Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2016, for example, refer to the year ended January 31, 2016.OverviewWorkday provides financial management, human capital management, and analytics applications designed for the world's largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources.We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today – in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our Human Capital Management (HCM) application in 2006, and our Financial Management application in 2007. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers.We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with three-year terms and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications through our direct sales force.We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes large, global companies and our direct sales force generally targets organizations with more than 1,000 workers. A substantial amount of our growth comes from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to the significant growth of our employee population. We had approximately 5,200 and approximately 3,750 employees as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our application development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, through investments in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, building and leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of services partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center infrastructure as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our expanding partner ecosystem, we will not be ramping our professional services organization at the same growth rates as we have in the past, and we expect professional services revenues and the cost of professional services as a percentage of total revenues will continue to decline over time.26Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe primarily derive our revenues from subscription services fees and professional services fees. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include routine customer support at no additional cost. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenues accounted for 80% of our total revenues during fiscal 2016 and represented 97% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2016. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the number of applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Compared to our other offerings, our HCM application has been available for a longer period of time, is more established in the marketplace and has benefited from continued enhancements of the functionality over a longer period of time, all of which help us to improve our pricing for that application. However, new products or services offerings by competitors in the future could impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services fees are generally recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer, which is generally within one week of contract signing. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years and are non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. Amounts that have not yet been invoiced represent backlog and are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.The majority of our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed. We offer a number of training options intended to support our customers in configuring, using and administering our services. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As Workday’s professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing customer support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel. The percentage of total revenues derived from professional services was 20% in fiscal 2016. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscription services.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs and travel. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. Commissions earned by our sales force that can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract are generally deferred and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable contract.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.27Table of ContentsResults of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016% Change 2014 to 2015% Change (in thousands, except percentages)Subscription services$929,234 $613,328 $354,169 52% 73%Professional services233,112 174,532 114,769 34% 52%Total revenues$1,162,346 $787,860 $468,938 48% 68%Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Total revenues were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $788 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $374 million, or 48%. Subscription services revenues were $929 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $613 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $316 million, or 52%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year period. Professional services revenues were $233 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $175 million for the prior year period, an increase of $58 million, or 34%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Total revenues were $788 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $469 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $319 million, or 68%. Subscription services revenues were $613 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $354 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $259 million, or 73%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year period. Professional services revenues were $175 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $115 million for the prior year period, an increase of $60 million, or 52%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services.Core Operating ExpensesWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of core operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. We believe that core operating expenses reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as it excludes expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that core operating expenses provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.The following discussion of our core operating expenses and the components comprising our core operating expenses highlights the factors that we focus upon in evaluating our operating margin and operating expenses. The increases or decreases in operating expenses discussed in this section do not include changes relating to share-based compensation expenses, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.28Table of ContentsReconciliations of our core operating expenses to the nearest GAAP measure, total operating expenses, are as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2016 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands, except percentages)Costs of subscription services$137,395 $12,060 $414 $149,869Costs of professional services204,264 19,526 768 224,558Product development353,381 109,362 7,201 469,944Sales and marketing380,957 51,617 1,482 434,056General and administrative89,078 57,405 2,095 148,578Total $1,165,075 $249,970 $11,960 $1,427,005Operating loss$(2,729) $(249,970) $(11,960) $(264,659)Operating margin(0.2)% (21.6)% (1.0)% (22.8)% Year Ended January 31, 2015 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands, except percentages)Costs of subscription services$96,219 $6,053 $204 $102,476Costs of professional services148,986 12,890 451 162,327Product development249,709 63,938 3,221 316,868Sales and marketing284,545 29,875 1,420 315,840General and administrative61,557 43,292 1,202 106,051Total $841,016 $156,048 $6,498 $1,003,562Operating loss$(53,156) $(156,048) $(6,498) $(215,702)Operating margin(6.7)% (19.8)% (0.9)% (27.4)% Year Ended January 31, 2014 CoreOperatingExpenses(1) Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses TotalOperatingExpenses (in thousands, except percentages)Costs of subscription services$66,770 $2,408 $17 $69,195Costs of professional services102,141 4,818 656 107,615Product development158,928 21,644 1,544 182,116Sales and marketing184,359 12,131 883 197,373General and administrative43,773 20,850 1,298 65,921Total $555,971 $61,851 $4,398 $622,220Operating loss$(87,033) $(61,851) $(4,398) $(153,282)Operating margin(18.6)% (13.2)% (0.9)% (32.7)%(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Core Operating MarginCore operating margins, calculated using GAAP revenues and core operating expenses, improved from (6.7)% for fiscal 2015 to (0.2)% for fiscal 2016 and from (18.6)% for fiscal 2014 to (6.7)% for fiscal 2015. The improvement in our core operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues in both fiscal 2016 and 2015 compared to prior fiscal years. The improvement in fiscal 2016 was also due to higher professional services revenues driven by improved utilization rates and increased demand for services, and improvements in operating leverage. 29Table of ContentsIn evaluating our results, we generally focus on core operating expenses. We believe that our core operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Our core operating expenses are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure, “total operating expenses,” in the table above.Core operating expenses increased by $324 million, or 39% for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, and by $285 million, or 51% for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. As quantified below, these increases for both periods were primarily due to higher employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.Costs of Subscription ServicesFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Core operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $137 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $96 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $41 million, or 43%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $13 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $12 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, $7 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity, and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $96 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $67 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $29 million, or 43%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $10 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $9 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, $6 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity, and $3 million in facility and IT-related expenses.We expect that core operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our data center capacity and operations.Costs of Professional ServicesFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Core operating expenses in costs of professional services were $204 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $149 million for fiscal 2015, a $55 million increase, or 37%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $37 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses. Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in costs of professional services were $149 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $102 million for fiscal 2014, a $47 million increase, or 46%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $36 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $4 million in facility and IT-related expenses. Due to the large increase in demand for our professional services, we have increased both our internal professional service staff as well as third-party supplemental staff. Going forward, we expect costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we increasingly rely on third parties to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. For fiscal 2017, we anticipate professional services margins to be lower than fiscal 2016 as we invest in building our partnership ecosystem in the education and government sectors, as well as internationally.Product DevelopmentFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Core operating expenses in product development were $353 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $250 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $103 million, or 41%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $73 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $20 million in facility and IT-related expenses, $4 million in third party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $3 million in depreciation expense for our development cloud data center.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in product development were $250 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $159 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $91 million, or 57%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $66 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $9 million in facility and IT-related expenses, $6 million in depreciation expense for our development cloud data center and $5 million in third party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.We expect that product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and MarketingFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Core operating expenses in sales and marketing were $381 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $285 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $96 million, or 34%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $15 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $10 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $6 million in travel.30Table of ContentsFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in sales and marketing were $285 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $184 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $101 million, or 55%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $68 million in employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $17 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $7 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $6 million in travel.We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the expansion of our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to build brand awareness and attract new customers.General and AdministrativeFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Core operating expenses in general and administrative were $89 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $62 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $27 million, or 44%. The increase was primarily due to $13 million in higher employee compensation costs due to higher headcount and $10 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal and audit.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Core operating expenses in general and administrative were $62 million for fiscal 2015, compared to $44 million for fiscal 2014, an increase of $18 million, or 41%. The increase was primarily due to $12 million in higher employee compensation costs due to higher headcount, $4 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal and audit and $2 million in facility and IT-related expenses.We expect general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.Share-Based Compensation ExpensesShare-based compensation expenses were $250 million, $156 million and $62 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to grants of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units to existing and new employees. The increase in share-based compensation expenses for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees, as well as a change in the timing of the cycle in which we grant additional equity awards to existing employees which resulted in grants that were made earlier in the fiscal year in fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the realized excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation were immaterial. The next grant to existing employees is planned for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Other Operating ExpensesOther operating expenses include employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions of $9 million, $5 million and $4 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, other operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $3 million and $1 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was no amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in fiscal 2014. Other Expense, NetOther expense, net, was $24 million, $30 million, and $18 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in other expense, net for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the gain on sale of a cost method investment in fiscal 2016 of $3 million. The increase in other expense, net for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the interest expense related to our June 2013 issuance of 0.75% convertible senior notes due October 15, 2018 (2018 Notes) and 1.50% convertible senior notes due October 15, 2020 (2020 Notes, and together with the 2018 Notes, the Notes), as we incurred a full period of interest expense in fiscal 2015.We issued the Notes in June 2013, and therefore incurred interest on the Notes for only a portion of fiscal 2014.The contractual cash interest expense related to the Notes was $6 million, $6 million and $4 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The associated non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs was $26 million, $24 million and $14 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.0 billion, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. corporate securities, commercial paper, and money market funds.31Table of ContentsWe have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, customer payments, and issuance of debt. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing of construction of our new development center in Pleasanton, California, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our services, and acquisition activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing.Our cash flows for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in thousands)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$258,637 $102,003 $46,263Investing activities(300,147) (404,167) (682,633)Financing activities44,109 19,455 1,133,610Effect of exchange rate changes(704) (425) (72)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,895 $(283,134) $497,168In evaluating our performance internally, we focus on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. We define free cash flows, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Our free cash flows for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in thousands)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$258,637 $102,003 $46,263Purchases of property and equipment(133,667) (103,646) (60,725)Property and equipment acquired under capital leases— — (115)Purchase of other intangible assets— — (15,000)Free cash flows$124,970 $(1,643) $(29,577)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $259 million, $102 million and $46 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The improvements in cash flows provided by operating activities in both fiscal 2016 and 2015 compared to prior fiscal years resulted primarily from increased cash collections driven by growth in our customer sales contracts, partially offset by increases in our headcount related and other operational expenses. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $300 million, $404 million and $683 million, respectively, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures of $134 million, $104 million and $61 million, respectively. During fiscal 2016, we paid $31 million to acquire new businesses and $17 million to purchase cost method investments, and we received proceeds of $103 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and $4 million from the sale of a cost method investment. During fiscal 2015, we paid $26 million to acquire a new business and $10 million to purchase a cost method investment, and received proceeds of $53 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities. During fiscal 2014, we paid $10 million to purchase a leasehold interest in land in Pleasanton adjacent to our existing office space and $5 million to acquire patents. We expect capital expenditures, excluding our development center, will be approximately $175 million for fiscal 2017. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. We expect capital expenditures for the development center will be approximately $125 million for fiscal 2017.32Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $44 million, primarily as a result of $46 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by $3 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations.For fiscal 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $19 million, primarily as a result of $36 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by $10 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations and $8 million of Class A common share repurchases for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock.For fiscal 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $1 billion, primarily as a result of $584 million in net proceeds from issuance of the Notes, $592 million in net proceeds from our follow-on offering of Class A common stock, $93 million in proceeds from the issuance of warrants related to the Notes and $24 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by $144 million to purchase convertible senior notes hedges and $12 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations. We purchased the convertible senior notes hedges to offset potential economic dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Notes.Free Cash FlowsIn addition to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, management uses free cash flows as a key financial metric. Free cash flows increased by $127 million to $125 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $(2) million for fiscal 2015 and increased by $28 million to $(2) million for fiscal 2015, compared to $(30) million for fiscal 2014. The improvement in free cash flows in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to increased sales and related cash collections, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and higher operating expenses, driven primarily by increased headcount. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Core Operating ExpensesWe define core operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of share-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Moreover, determining the fair value of certain of the share-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards. Unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options and shares offered under the ESPP, which are elements of our ongoing share-based compensation expenses, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control.•Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.33Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowsWe define free cash flows as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment, property and equipment acquired under capital leases and purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets. We use free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business, as it balances operating results, cash management and capital efficiency. When calculating free cash flows, we subtract the gross value of all equipment paid for or acquired under capital leases, so that we can evaluate our progress on free cash flows independent of our capital financing decisions. We believe information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, to fund ongoing operations and to fund other capital expenditures.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of core operating expenses, core operating margin and free cash flows should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. Further, the non-GAAP measure of core operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP measure of total operating expenses. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling core operating expenses to the most comparable GAAP financial measure and reviewing these measures in conjunction with GAAP financial information. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See “Results of Operations—Core Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of core operating expenses to the most comparable GAAP measure, “total operating expenses,” for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a reconciliation of free cash flows to the most comparable GAAP measure, “net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.BacklogWe generally sign multiple-year subscription contracts for our applications. The timing of our invoices to each customer is a negotiated term and varies among our subscription contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, unearned revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider those future subscription invoices to be non-cancelable backlog. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have a fully executed non-cancelable contract and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as customer funding or the delivery of a specific product or feature. The amount of non-cancelable subscription contract backlog was $1.6 billion and $965 million as of January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the amount invoiced early in the contract term, the timing and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.34Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2016: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018(1)$350,000 $— $350,000 $— $—1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020(1)250,000 — — 250,000 —Aggregate interest obligation(2)23,154 6,375 11,321 5,458 —Operating lease obligations: Facilities space(3)177,165 44,370 56,437 37,177 39,181Facilities space with related party77,315 7,540 17,951 18,699 33,125Contractual commitments7,083 7,083 — — —Total$884,717 $65,368 $435,709 $311,334 $72,306(1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the notes, without the effect of associated discounts.(2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash.(3) For the 95-year lease we entered in January 2013, the cash obligations exclude the potential annual rental increases based on the increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). (See more information under “commitments” below). We believe it is likely we will make higher rent payments over the lease term due to future changes in the CPI.CommitmentsOur contractual commitments primarily consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity. For fiscal 2017, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In addition, our existing lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. We expect our future operating lease obligations will increase as we expand our operations.In January 2014, we entered into a 95-year lease for a 6.9 acre parcel of land in Pleasanton, California, under which we paid $2 million for base rent from commencement through December 31, 2020. Annual rent payments of $0.2 million plus increases based on increases in the consumer price index begin on January 1, 2021 and continue through the end of the lease. We expect to start construction of our new development center, consisting of approximately 410,000 square feet of office space, on this property during the first half of fiscal 2017. We have entered into an agreement with a contractor for the construction of the new development center, however it is not included in the table above because it allows for termination without significant penalty. As noted in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section above, we expect capital expenditures related to the development center will be approximately $125 million for fiscal 2017. We are not required to make principal payments under the Notes prior to maturity. If the Notes are not converted to Class A common stock prior to their maturity dates, we are required to repay $350 million in principal on July 15, 2018 and $250 million in principal on July 15, 2020. We are also required to make interest payments on a semi-annual basis at the interest rates described in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.35Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees and from professional services fees, including training. We sell subscriptions to our cloud applications through contracts that are generally three years in length. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. Our subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts.We commence revenue recognition for our cloud applications and professional services when all of the following criteria are met:•There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been or is being provided to the customer;•Collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Subscription Services RevenuesSubscription services revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered.Subscription contracts have standalone value as we sell the subscriptions separately. All of our professional services have standalone value and can be accounted for separately from subscription services, given the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and ongoing sales of our applications to new customers without professional services.When multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangement accounting guidance provides a hierarchy when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. If neither VSOE nor TPE exist for a deliverable, arrangements with multiple deliverables can be separated into discrete units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.36Table of ContentsWe determine the best estimate of selling price for our deliverables based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. We evaluate our best estimate of selling price by reviewing historical data related to sales of our deliverables, including comparing the percentages of our contract prices to our list prices. We also consider several other data points in our evaluation, including the size of our arrangements, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics and the numbers and types of users within our arrangements.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered to be direct sales commissions when they can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract. Direct sales commissions are deferred when earned and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable subscription contract. The commission payments are paid in full after the customer has paid for its first year of service. During fiscal 2016, we deferred $32 million of commissions and we amortized $20 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2015, we deferred $23 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $16 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $51 million and $37 million at January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Convertible Senior NotesIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized to expense over the respective terms of the Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid-in capital.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.37Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our most significant currency exposures are the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Canadian Dollar. Due to the relative size of our international operations to date and the fact that the majority of our contracts are currently in U.S. dollars, our foreign currency exposure has been fairly limited. We anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase over time, and, as a result, we have a hedging program focused on certain currencies. For fiscal 2017 and beyond, we expect the number of contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollars to increase.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.0 billion as of January 31, 2016. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. corporate securities, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our marketable securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $8 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2016. Each of our investments earn less than 100-basis points and as a result, an immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $5 million as of January 31, 2016. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In June 2013, we issued $350 million of 2018 Notes and $250 million of 2020 Notes. Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election. Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. Our Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 0.75% and 1.50% and, therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our Notes. However, the values of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the 2018 Notes and the 2020 Notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying values of our 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes were $307 million and $201 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2016. These represent the liability component of the principal balance of our Notes as of January 31, 2016. The total estimated fair values of the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes at January 31, 2016 were $362 million and $264 million, respectively, and the fair value was determined based on the quoted bid price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last day of trading for the fiscal period ended at January 31, 2016, which were $103.50 and $105.63, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.”OverviewWorkday provides financial management, human capital management, and analytics applications designed for the world's largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources.We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today – in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our Human Capital Management application in 2006, and our Financial Management application in 2007. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers.We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with three-year terms and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications through our direct sales force.We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global companies, and our direct sales force generally targets organizations with more than 1,000 workers. A substantial amount of our growth comes from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to the significant growth of our employee population. We had approximately 6,600 and approximately 5,200 employees as of January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our application development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring, building and/or leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of services partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center infrastructure as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect that the rate of professional services revenue growth will decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth. Components of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe primarily derive our revenues from subscription services fees and professional services fees. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include routine customer support. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training.26Table of ContentsSubscription services revenues accounted for 82% of our total revenues during fiscal 2017 and represented 97% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2017. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the maturity of the product and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services fees are generally recognized ratably as revenues over the contract term beginning on the date the application is made available to the customer, which is generally within one to two weeks of contract signature. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or more and are non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. Amounts that have not yet been invoiced represent backlog and are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements.The majority of our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed. We offer a number of training options intended to support our customers in configuring, using and administering our services. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As Workday’s professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing customer support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel. The percentage of total revenues derived from professional services was 18% in fiscal 2017. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscription services.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs and travel. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. Commissions earned by our sales force that can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract are generally deferred and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable contract.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems personnel, professional fees and other corporate expenses.Results of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017% Change 2015 to 2016% Change (in thousands, except percentages)Subscription services$1,287,104 $929,234 $613,328 39% 52%Professional services282,303 233,112 174,532 21% 34%Total revenues$1,569,407 $1,162,346 $787,860 35% 48%27Table of ContentsTotal revenues were $1.6 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $407 million, or 35%. Subscription services revenues were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $929 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $358 million, or 39%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenues were $282 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $233 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $49 million, or 21%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to our delivery of services to a greater number of customers.Total revenues were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $788 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $374 million, or 48%. Subscription services revenues were $929 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $613 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $316 million, or 52%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenues were $233 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $175 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $58 million, or 34%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to our delivery of services to a greater number of customers.Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 36%. The increases were primarily due to an increase of $0.4 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization and service contracts to expand data center capacity. GAAP operating expenses were $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 42%. The increases were primarily due to an increase of $0.3 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation and amortization.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP operating expenses are calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 32%, primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $0.8 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 39%. The increases were primarily due to an increase of $0.2 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation and amortization.Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2017 GAAP OperatingExpenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses (1) OtherOperatingExpenses (2) Non-GAAP OperatingExpenses(3)Costs of subscription services$213,389 $(20,773) $(730) $191,886Costs of professional services270,156 (26,833) (1,199) 242,124Product development680,531 (166,529) (18,533) 495,469Sales and marketing583,874 (86,229) (3,316) 494,329General and administrative198,122 (78,265) (3,302) 116,555Total costs and expenses$1,946,072 $(378,629) $(27,080) $1,540,36328Table of Contents Year Ended January 31, 2016 GAAP OperatingExpenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses (1) OtherOperatingExpenses (2) Non-GAAP OperatingExpenses(3)Costs of subscription services$149,869 $(12,060) $(414) $137,395Costs of professional services224,558 (19,526) (768) 204,264Product development469,944 (109,362) (7,201) 353,381Sales and marketing434,056 (51,617) (1,482) 380,957General and administrative148,578 (57,405) (2,095) 89,078Total costs and expenses$1,427,005 $(249,970) $(11,960) $1,165,075 Year Ended January 31, 2015 GAAP OperatingExpenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses (1) OtherOperatingExpenses (2) Non-GAAP OperatingExpenses(3)Costs of subscription services$102,476 $(6,053) $(204) $96,219Costs of professional services162,327 (12,890) (451) 148,986Product development316,868 (63,938) (3,221) 249,709Sales and marketing315,840 (29,875) (1,420) 284,545General and administrative106,051 (43,292) (1,202) 61,557Total costs and expenses$1,003,562 $(156,048) $(6,498) $841,016(1) Share-based compensation expenses were $379 million, $250 million and $156 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses was primarily due to grants of RSUs to existing and new employees. During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the realized excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation were immaterial.(2) Other operating expenses include employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions of $14 million, $9 million and $5 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, other operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $13 million, $3 million and $1 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is recorded as part of product development expenses and sales and marketing expenses.(3) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Costs of Subscription ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $213 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $150 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $63 million, or 42%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $30 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $12 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity, $12 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses.GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $150 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $102 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $48 million, or 47%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $20 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $12 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, $7 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $192 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $137 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $55 million, or 40%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $21 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $12 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity, and $12 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $137 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $96 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $41 million, or 43%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $13 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $12 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, $7 million in service contracts expense to expand data center capacity and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our data center capacity and operations.29Table of ContentsCosts of Professional ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $270 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $225 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $45 million, or 20%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $45 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements. GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $225 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $162 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $63 million, or 39%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $51 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $242 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $204 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $38 million, or 19%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $38 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements. Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $204 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $149 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $55 million, or 37%. This increase was primarily due to increases of $37 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements and $6 million in facility and IT-related expenses. Going forward, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we increasingly rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP professional services margins to be lower than fiscal 2017 as we invest in programs to ensure ongoing customer success.Product DevelopmentGAAP operating expenses in product development were $681 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $470 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $211 million, or 45%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $166 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount, $24 million in facility and IT-related expenses, $10 million in amortization expense for our acquisition-related intangible assets and $6 million in third party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.GAAP operating expenses in product development were $470 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $317 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $153 million, or 48%.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $73 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount, $20 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $4 million in third party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and MarketingGAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $584 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $434 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $150 million, or 35%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $119 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $12 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $10 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $7 million in travel.GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $434 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $316 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $118 million, or 37%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $87 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $15 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $10 million in facility and IT-related expenses and $6 million in travel.Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $494 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $381 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $113 million, or 30%.

The reductions in our GAAP operating margins were primarily due to higher share-based compensation and other operating expenses, including a one-time acquisition expense, offset by higher revenues.GAAP operating margins improved from (27.4)% for fiscal 2015 to (22.8)% for fiscal 2016. The improvements in our GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues and improvements in operating leverage. We use non-GAAP operating margins to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. We believe that non-GAAP operating margins reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that non-GAAP operating margins provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.Non-GAAP operating margins are calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.31Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating margins improved from (0.2)% for fiscal 2016 to 1.9% for fiscal 2017. The improvements in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues and improvements in operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating margins improved from (6.7)% for fiscal 2015 to (0.2)% for fiscal 2016. The improvements in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues and improvements in operating leverage. Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating margins were as follows: Year ended January 31, 2017 GAAPOperatingExpenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses Non-GAAPOperatingExpenses (1)Operating margin(24.0)% 24.1% 1.8% 1.9% Year ended January 31, 2016 GAAPOperatingExpenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses Non-GAAPOperatingExpenses (1)Operating margin(22.8)% 21.6% 1.0% (0.2)% Year ended January 31, 2015 GAAPOperatingExpenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses OtherOperatingExpenses Non-GAAPOperatingExpenses (1)Operating margin(27.4)% 19.8% 0.9% (6.7)%(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Other Expense, NetOther expense, net, was $32 million, $24 million, and $30 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in other expense, net for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impairment of a cost method investment in fiscal 2017 of $15 million offset by an increase in interest income of $6 million. The decrease in other expense, net for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the gain on sale of a cost method investment in fiscal 2016 of $3 million. The contractual cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes was $6 million per year for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. The associated non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount and amortization of debt issuance costs was $27 million, $26 million and $24 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.0 billion, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.We have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, customer payments, and issuance of debt. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing of construction of facilities in Pleasanton, California and acquisition of additional facilities, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our services, and acquisition activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing.32Table of ContentsOur cash flows for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in thousands)Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$348,655 $258,637 $102,003Investing activities(168,885) (300,147) (404,167)Financing activities59,681 44,109 19,455Effect of exchange rate changes385 (704) (425)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$239,836 $1,895 $(283,134)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $349 million, $259 million and $102 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The improvements in cash flows provided by operating activities in both fiscal 2017 and 2016 compared to prior fiscal years resulted primarily from increased cash collections driven by growth in our customer sales contracts, partially offset by increases in our headcount related and other operational expenses. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $169 million, which was primarily the result of timing of purchase and maturities of marketable securities, a net cash outflow of $148 million related to acquisitions, $73 million spent on acquisition of and renovations to office buildings and land in Pleasanton, California, capital expenditures for the development center of $34 million and capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $121 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $133 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and $5 million from the maturity of a cost method investment.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 was $300 million, which was primarily the result of timing of purchase and maturities of marketable securities, a net cash outflow of $31 million related to acquisitions, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $134 million and cash paid to purchase cost method investments of $17 million. These payments were offset by proceeds of $103 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and $4 million from the sale of a cost method investment.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2015 was $404 million, which was primarily the result of timing of purchase and maturities of marketable securities, a net cash outflow of $26 million related to acquisitions, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $104 million and cash paid to purchase cost method investments of $10 million. These payments were offset by proceeds of $53 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities.We expect capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects, will be approximately $160 million for fiscal 2018. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. We began construction of our development center, consisting of approximately 410,000 square feet of office space in Pleasanton, California, during fiscal 2017. We expect capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects will be approximately $175 million for fiscal 2018.Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $60 million, primarily as a result of $58 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.For fiscal 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $44 million, primarily as a result of $46 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by $3 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations.For fiscal 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $19 million, primarily as a result of $36 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by $10 million in principal payments on our capital lease obligations and $8 million of Class A common share repurchases for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock.33Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowsIn evaluating our performance internally, we focus on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. We define free cash flows, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures (excluding owned real estate projects). See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Free cash flows improved by $103 million to $228 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $125 million for fiscal 2016. The improvement was primarily due to increases in sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount.Free cash flows improved by $127 million to $125 million for fiscal 2016, compared to $(2) million for fiscal 2015. The improvement was primarily due to increases in sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by increases in capital expenditures (excluding owned real estate projects) and higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount.Reconciliations of Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flows were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$348,655 $258,637 $102,003Capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects(120,813) (133,667) (103,646)Free cash flows$227,842 $124,970 $(1,643)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses and non-GAAP Operating MarginsWe define non-GAAP operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. Similarly, the same components are also excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP operating margins. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of share-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Moreover, determining the fair value of certain of the share-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related share-based awards. Unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options and shares offered under the ESPP, which are elements of our ongoing share-based compensation expenses, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility and forfeiture rates, that are beyond our control.•Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.34Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowsWe define free cash flows as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures (excluding owned real estate projects). Capital expenditures deducted from cash flows from operations do not include purchases of land and buildings, and construction costs of our new development center and of other owned buildings. We exclude these owned real estate projects as they are infrequent, non-recurring in nature and distinctly separate from our ongoing business operations. We use free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business, as it balances operating results, cash management and capital efficiency. We believe information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, to fund ongoing operations and to fund other capital expenditures.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flows should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures and reviewing these measures in conjunction with GAAP financial information. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses and Results of Operations—Operating Margins for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating margins, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins, for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flows for a reconciliation from the most comparable GAAP financial measure, Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, to the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. BacklogWe generally sign multiple-year subscription contracts for our applications. The timing of our invoices to each customer is a negotiated term and varies among our subscription contracts. For multiple-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, unearned revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider those future subscription invoices to be non-cancelable backlog. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have a fully executed non-cancelable contract and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as customer funding or the delivery of a specific product or feature. The amount of non-cancelable subscription contract backlog was $2.5 billion and $1.6 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the amount invoiced early in the contract term, the timing and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.35Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2017 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018(1)$350,000 $— $350,000 $— $—1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020(1)250,000 — — 250,000 —Aggregate interest obligation(2)16,779 6,375 8,696 1,708 —Operating lease obligations: Facilities space, not including related party(3)155,188 42,686 52,148 28,671 31,683Facilities space with related party72,234 8,489 19,128 19,906 24,711Computing infrastructure platform obligations97,500 6,000 17,000 25,000 49,500Other contractual obligations7,252 7,252 — — —Total$948,953 $70,802 $446,972 $325,285 $105,894(1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the Notes, without the effect of associated discounts.(2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash.(3) For the 95-year lease we entered in January 2014, the cash obligations exclude the potential annual rental increases based on the increases to the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""). We believe it is likely we will make higher rent payments over the lease term due to future changes in the CPI.Our contractual obligations primarily consist of our convertible senior notes due in 2018 and 2020, as well as obligations under leases for office space, co-location facilities for data center capacity and computing infrastructure platforms for business operations. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In addition, our existing lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. We expect our future operating lease obligations will increase as we expand our operations.We are not required to make principal payments under the Notes prior to maturity. If the Notes are not converted to Class A common stock prior to their maturity dates, we are required to repay $350 million in principal on July 15, 2018 and $250 million in principal on July 15, 2020. We are also required to make interest payments on a semi-annual basis at the interest rates described in Note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.In January 2014, we entered into a 95-year lease for a 6.9 acre parcel of land in Pleasanton, California, under which we paid $2 million for base rent from commencement through December 31, 2020. Annual rent payments of $0.2 million plus increases based on increases in the consumer price index begin on January 1, 2021 and continue through the end of the lease. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we started construction of our new development center, consisting of approximately 410,000 square feet of office space, on this property. The agreement with the contractor for the construction of the development center is not included in the table above because it allows for termination without significant penalty. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.36Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees and from professional services fees, including training. We sell subscriptions to our cloud applications through contracts that are generally three years or more in length. Our arrangements are generally non-cancelable. Our subscription contracts do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts.We commence revenue recognition for our cloud applications and professional services when all of the following criteria are met:•There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been or is being provided to the customer;•Collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Subscription Services RevenuesSubscription services revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts. The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and materials basis. Training revenues are recognized as the services are rendered.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we evaluate whether the individual deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately and revenue is recognized for the respective deliverables as they are delivered.Subscription contracts have standalone value as we sell the subscriptions separately. All of our professional services have standalone value and can be accounted for separately from subscription services, given the availability of the professional services from other vendors, the nature of our professional services and ongoing sales of our applications to new customers without professional services.When multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price. Multiple deliverable arrangement accounting guidance provides a hierarchy when determining the relative selling price for each unit of accounting. Vendor-specific objective evidence (""VSOE"") of selling price, based on the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis, should be used if it exists. If VSOE of selling price is not available, third-party evidence (""TPE"") of selling price is used to establish the selling price if it exists. If neither VSOE nor TPE exist for a deliverable, arrangements with multiple deliverables can be separated into discrete units of accounting based on our best estimate of selling price. The amount of arrangement fee allocated is limited by contingent revenues, if any.37Table of ContentsWe determine the best estimate of selling price for our deliverables based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and entity-specific factors. We evaluate our best estimate of selling price by reviewing historical data related to sales of our deliverables, including comparing the percentages of our contract prices to our list prices. We also consider several other data points in our evaluation, including the size of our arrangements, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, and the numbers and types of users within our arrangements.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered to be direct sales commissions when they can be associated specifically with a non-cancelable subscription contract. Direct sales commissions are deferred when earned and amortized over the same period that revenues are recognized for the related non-cancelable subscription contract. The commission payments are paid in full after the customer has paid for its first year of service. During fiscal 2017, we deferred $44 million of commissions and we amortized $25 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal 2016, we deferred $32 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $20 million to sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $70 million and $51 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Convertible Senior NotesIn accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized to expense over the respective terms of the Notes, and issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted with the respective equity component in additional paid-in capital.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.38Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2017 and 2016, our most significant currency exposures were the Euro, British pound and Canadian dollar. We have a hedging program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts. For further information, see Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.0 billion as of January 31, 2017 and 2016. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our marketable securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $9 million and $8 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of our investments earn less than 100-basis points and as a result, an immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $8 million and $5 million as of January 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2013, we issued $350 million of 2018 Notes and $250 million of 2020 Notes. Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders of the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes will receive cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election.Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes.Our Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 0.75% and 1.50% and, therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our Notes. However, the values of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the 2018 Notes and the 2020 Notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying values of our 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes were $324 million and $211 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2017. These represent the liability component of the principal balance of our Notes as of January 31, 2017. The total estimated fair values of the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes at January 31, 2017 were $402 million and $310 million, respectively, and the fair value was determined based on the quoted bid price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2017, which were $114.93 and $124.19, respectively. For further information, see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.39Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:10.526826

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in ""Risk Factors.""OverviewWorkday provides financial management, human capital management, and analytics applications designed for the world's largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers highly adaptable, accessible, and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources.We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today—in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced, and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our HCM application in 2006, and our Financial Management application in 2007. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers.We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with contract terms of three years or longer and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications through our direct sales force.Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global companies. We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to the significant growth of our employee population. We had approximately 8,200 and approximately 6,600 employees as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring, building and/or leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center infrastructure as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and will make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.Since inception, we have invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional service partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect that the rate of professional services revenue growth will decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth. Components of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe primarily derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training.26Table of ContentsSubscription services revenues accounted for 83% of our total revenues during fiscal 2018 and represented 97% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2018. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services revenues are recognized over time as they are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. The majority of our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized over time as the services are performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As our professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing customer support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and travel.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and are deferred and amortized. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, human resources, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.Results of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended January 31, 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018% Change 2016 to 2017% Change *As Adjusted *As Adjusted Subscription services$1,787,833 $1,290,733 $920,196 39% 40%Professional services355,217 283,707 236,494 25% 20%Total revenues$2,143,050 $1,574,440 $1,156,690 36% 36%*See Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments.27Table of ContentsTotal revenues were $2.1 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 36%. Subscription services revenues were $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 39%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenues were $0.4 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $0.3 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.1 billion, or 25%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers and a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services. Total revenues were $1.6 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 36%. Subscription services revenues were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $0.9 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 40%.

Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 27%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.4 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity.GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 37%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.4 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP operating expenses are calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 27%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.3 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 33%.

The improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues, and improvements in operating leverage. GAAP operating margins declined from (21.6)% for fiscal 2016 to (22.4)% for fiscal 2017. The reduction in our GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher share-based compensation and other operating expenses, including a one-time acquisition expense, offset by higher revenues.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating margins to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance and the ability of operations to generate cash. We believe that non-GAAP operating margins reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results.

See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for further information.31Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating margins improved from 3.3% for fiscal 2017 to 10.1% for fiscal 2018. The improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues, and improvements in operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating margins improved from 1.0% for fiscal 2016 to 3.3% for fiscal 2017. The improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues, and improvements in operating leverage.

The decrease in other expense, net for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was caused by an increase in interest income of $14 million, a decrease in cost method investment impairment of $14 million, and an increase in other income of $6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $14 million.The increase in other expense, net for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the impairment of a cost method investment in fiscal 2017 of $15 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income of $6 million.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.3 billion, which were held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.We have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, customer payments, and issuance of debt. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing of construction of facilities in Pleasanton, California and the acquisition of additional facilities, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our services, and acquisition activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing.32Table of ContentsOur cash flows for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2018 2017 2016 *As Adjusted *As AdjustedNet cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$465,727 $350,626 $258,637Investing activities(978,980) (168,885) (300,147)Financing activities1,106,262 59,681 44,109Effect of exchange rate changes751 385 (704)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$593,760 $241,807 $1,895*See Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $466 million, $351 million, and $259 million for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The improvements in cash flows provided by operating activities in both fiscal 2018 and 2017 compared to prior fiscal years resulted primarily from increased sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 was $979 million, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures for owned real estate projects, including construction of our customer briefing and development center (""development center"") of $125 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $142 million, the purchase of cost method investments of $16 million, the purchase of other non-acquisition related intangible assets of $11 million, and a net cash outflow of $6 million related to an acquisition. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $244 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $169 million, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, a net cash outflow of $148 million related to acquisitions, purchases of office buildings and land in Pleasanton, California for $62 million, capital expenditures for owned real estate projects (including construction of our development center) of $45 million, and capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $121 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $133 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and $5 million from the sales and maturities of cost method investments.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 was $300 million, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, a net cash outflow of $31 million related to acquisitions, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $134 million, and the purchase of cost method investments of $17 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $103 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities and $4 million from the sales and maturities of cost method investments.We expect capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects, including development of our development center, will be approximately $200 million for fiscal 2019. We expect capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects, will be approximately $200 million for fiscal 2019. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion, which was primarily due to the issuance of $1.15 billion principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022, net of issuance costs of $18 million, and the related sale of warrants for $81 million and purchase of note hedges for $176 million. For further information, see Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. In addition, cash flows from financing activities included $69 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.For fiscal 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $60 million, primarily as a result of $58 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.For fiscal 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $44 million, primarily as a result of $46 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.33Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowsIn evaluating our performance internally, we focus on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. We define free cash flows, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures (excluding owned real estate projects). See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for further information.Free cash flows improved by $94 million to $324 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $230 million for fiscal 2017. The improvement was primarily due to increases in sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount.Free cash flows improved by $105 million to $230 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $125 million for fiscal 2016. The improvement was primarily due to increases in sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount.Reconciliations of Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flows were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2018 2017 2016 *As Adjusted *As AdjustedNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities$465,727 $350,626 $258,637Capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects(141,536) (120,813) (133,667)Free cash flows$324,191 $229,813 $124,970*See Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), ""Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,"" defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating MarginsWe define non-GAAP operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. Similarly, the same components are also excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP operating margins. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeitures rates, that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. •Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.34Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowsWe define free cash flows as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures (excluding owned real estate projects). Capital expenditures deducted from cash flows from operations do not include purchases of land and buildings, and construction costs of our new development center and of other owned buildings. We exclude these owned real estate projects as they are infrequent in nature. For fiscal 2018, these costs primarily represented the construction of our new development center, which is anticipated to be completed in fiscal 2020. We use free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business, as it balances operating results, cash management, and capital efficiency. We believe information regarding free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on the cash available to make strategic acquisitions and investments, to fund ongoing operations, and to fund other capital expenditures.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses and Results of Operations—Operating Margins for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating margins, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins, for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. See Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flows for a reconciliation from the most comparable GAAP financial measure, Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, to the non-GAAP financial measure, free cash flow, for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2018 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (1)$350,000 $350,000 $— $— $—1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (1)250,000 — 250,000 — —0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (1)1,150,000 — — 1,150,000 —Aggregate interest obligation (2)23,829 7,821 11,208 4,800 —Operating lease obligations: Facilities space, not including related party (3)204,220 59,204 76,728 39,337 28,951Facilities space with related party84,254 11,103 25,669 26,821 20,661Computing infrastructure platform obligations87,461 7,461 16,500 29,250 34,250Contractual commitments42,768 25,686 5,841 4,671 6,570Total$2,192,532 $461,275 $385,946 $1,254,879 $90,432(1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the Notes, without the effect of associated discounts.(2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash.35Table of Contents(3) For the 95-year lease we entered in January 2014, the cash obligations exclude the potential annual rental increases based on the increases to the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""). We believe it is likely we will make higher rent payments over the lease term due to future changes in the CPI.Our contractual obligations primarily consist of our convertible senior notes, as well as obligations under leases for office space, co-location facilities for data center capacity, and computing infrastructure platforms for business operations. For fiscal 2019, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In addition, our existing lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. We expect our future operating lease obligations will increase as we expand our operations.We are not required to make principal payments under the Notes prior to maturity. If the Notes are not converted to Class A common stock prior to their maturity dates, we are required to repay $350 million in principal on July 15, 2018, $250 million in principal on July 15, 2020, and $1.15 billion in principal on October 1, 2022. We are also required to make interest payments on a semi-annual basis at the interest rates described in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.In January 2014, we entered into a 95-year lease for a 6.9 acre parcel of land in Pleasanton, California, under which we paid $2 million for base rent from commencement through December 31, 2020. Annual rent payments of $0.2 million plus increases based on increases in the CPI begin on January 1, 2021 and continue through the end of the lease. Our new development center, consisting of approximately 410,000 square feet of office space, is being constructed on this property. The agreement with the contractor for the construction of the development center is not included in the table above because it allows for termination without significant penalty. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation36Table of ContentsSubscription Services RevenuesSubscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our cloud applications for finance, human resources, and analytics, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts are generally three years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. The majority of our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.Contracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Convertible Senior NotesIn June 2013, we issued the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. In September 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes. In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.37Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, our most significant currency exposures were the Euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Australian dollar. Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. For further information, see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.3 billion and $2.0 billion as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investment portfolios are managed to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our marketable securities as ""available for sale,"" no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.An immediate increase of 100-basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $10 million and $9 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. An immediate decrease of 100-basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $10 million and $8 million as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities before maturity.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2013, we issued the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. In September 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes. Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election.Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes.The 2018, 2020, and 2022 Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 0.75%, 1.50%, and 0.25%, respectively, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our Notes. However, the values of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the Notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying values of the 2018, 2020, and 2022 Notes were $342 million, $221 million, and $928 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2018. These represent the liability component of the principal balance of our Notes as of January 31, 2018. The total estimated fair values of the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, and 2022 Notes as of January 31, 2018 were $505 million, $386 million, and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values were determined based on the quoted bid prices of the 2018, 2020, and 2022 Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last day of trading for fiscal 2018, which were $144.28, $154.22, and $104.40, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.”OverviewWorkday provides financial management, human capital management, planning, and analytics applications designed for the world’s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We offer innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer internet experience and cloud delivery model. Our applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. We provide our customers with highly adaptable, accessible, and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources.We were founded in 2005 to deliver cloud applications to global enterprises. Our applications are designed around the way people work today—in an environment that is global, collaborative, fast-paced, and mobile. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our HCM application in 2006 and our Financial Management application in 2007. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers.We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with contract terms of three years or longer and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications primarily through our direct sales force.Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global companies, as well as smaller organizations that primarily use our planning product. We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to the significant growth of our employee population. We had approximately 10,500 and approximately 8,200 employees as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring, building and/or leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center capacity as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. We expect to continue to make such acquisitions and investments in the future, and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the industry. While we remain focused on improving operating margins, these acquisitions and investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and could make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs and by utilizing more of the capacity of our data centers.Since inception, we have also invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional service partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect that the rate of professional services revenue growth will decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth. 29Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe primarily derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenues accounted for 85% of our total revenues during fiscal 2019 and represented 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2019. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services revenues are recognized over time as they are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. The majority of our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis, and revenues are typically recognized over time as the services are performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As our professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect the partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing customer support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, and travel.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality, and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and are deferred and amortized. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, human resources, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.30Table of ContentsResults of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended January 31, 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019% Change 2017 to 2018% Change *As Adjusted Subscription services$2,385,769 $1,787,833 $1,290,733 33% 39%Professional services436,411 355,217 283,707 23% 25%Total revenues$2,822,180 $2,143,050 $1,574,440 32% 36%*See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.Total revenues were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $2.1 billion for fiscal 2018, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 32%. Subscription services revenues were $2.4 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 33%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenues were $436 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $355 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $81 million, or 23%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to Workday performing deployment and integration services for a greater number of customers than in the prior year period. Total revenues were $2.1 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 36%. Subscription services revenues were $1.8 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 39%. The increase in subscription revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenues were $0.4 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $0.3 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.1 billion, or 25%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to the addition of new customers and a greater number of customers requesting deployment and integration services. Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $3.3 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 34%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.6 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity. These increases are partially attributable to the acquisition of Adaptive Insights and include one-time transaction and integration-related costs.GAAP operating expenses were $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 27%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.4 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP operating expenses are calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.5 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2018, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 31%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.4 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity. These increases are partially attributable to the acquisition of Adaptive Insights and include one-time transaction and integration-related costs.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of $0.4 billion, or 27%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $0.3 billion in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $0.1 billion in expenses related to facilities, IT, depreciation, amortization, and service contracts to expand data center capacity.31Table of ContentsReconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2019 GAAP Operating Expenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses (1) OtherOperatingExpenses (2) Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (3)Costs of subscription services$379,877 $(36,754) $(31,395) $311,728Costs of professional services455,073 (55,535) (3,653) 395,885Product development1,211,832 (320,876) (21,230) 869,726Sales and marketing891,345 (132,810) (19,725) 738,810General and administrative347,337 (127,443) (5,120) 214,774Total costs and expenses$3,285,464 $(673,418) $(81,123) $2,530,923 Year Ended January 31, 2018 GAAP Operating Expenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses (1) OtherOperatingExpenses (2) Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (3)Costs of subscription services$273,461 $(26,280) $(7,043) $240,138Costs of professional services355,952 (37,592) (2,045) 316,315Product development910,584 (229,819) (23,128) 657,637Sales and marketing683,367 (100,762) (4,567) 578,038General and administrative222,909 (83,972) (3,614) 135,323Total costs and expenses$2,446,273 $(478,425) $(40,397) $1,927,451 Year Ended January 31, 2017 GAAP Operating Expenses Share-BasedCompensationExpenses (1) OtherOperatingExpenses (2) Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (3) *As Adjusted *As AdjustedCosts of subscription services$213,389 $(20,773) $(730) $191,886Costs of professional services270,156 (26,833) (1,199) 242,124Product development680,531 (166,529) (18,533) 495,469Sales and marketing565,328 (86,229) (3,316) 475,783General and administrative198,122 (78,265) (3,302) 116,555Total costs and expenses$1,927,526 $(378,629) $(27,080) $1,521,817(1) Share-based compensation expenses were $673 million, $478 million, and $379 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses was primarily due to assumed Adaptive Insights awards and grants of RSUs to existing and new employees.(2) Other operating expenses include employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions of $32 million, $21 million, and $14 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In addition, other operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $49 million, $19 million, and $13 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $33 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $24 million in amortization expense for our acquisition-related intangible assets, $22 million in third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $19 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers.32Table of ContentsGAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $273 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $213 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $60 million, or 28%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $23 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, $22 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, and $10 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $312 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $240 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $72 million, or 30%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $22 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $22 million in third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $19 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $240 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $192 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $48 million, or 25%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $17 million in depreciation expense related to our data centers, $16 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, and $10 million in facility and IT-related expenses.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our data center capacity and operations.Costs of Professional ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $455 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $356 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $99 million, or 28%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $86 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements.GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $356 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $270 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $86 million, or 32%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $70 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $396 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $316 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $80 million, or 25%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $66 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $316 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $242 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $74 million, or 31%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $59 million to staff our deployment and integration engagements. Going forward, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we continue to rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. For fiscal 2020, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP professional services margins to be lower than fiscal 2019 as we invest in programs to ensure ongoing customer success.Product DevelopmentGAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $911 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $301 million, or 33%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $267 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and $26 million in facility and IT-related expenses.GAAP operating expenses in product development were $911 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $681 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $230 million, or 34%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $180 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount, $34 million in facility and IT-related expenses, and $15 million in third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $870 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $658 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $212 million, or 32%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $170 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and $26 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $658 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $495 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $163 million, or 33%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $113 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount, $34 million in facility and IT-related expenses, and $15 million in third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.33Table of ContentsSales and MarketingGAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $891 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $683 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $208 million, or 30%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $147 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $20 million in advertising, marketing, and event costs, $13 million in travel, and $11 million in facility and IT-related expenses.GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $683 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $565 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $118 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $87 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $14 million in advertising, marketing, and event costs, and $11 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $739 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $578 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $161 million, or 28%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $114 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $20 million in advertising, marketing, and event costs, $13 million in travel, and $11 million in facility and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $578 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $476 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $102 million, or 21%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $71 million in employee-related costs due to higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume, $14 million in advertising, marketing, and event costs, and $11 million in facility and IT-related expenses.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the expansion of our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to build brand awareness and attract new customers.General and AdministrativeGAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $347 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $223 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $124 million, or 56%. The increase was primarily due to additional employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and one-time transaction and integration-related costs due to the acquisition of Adaptive Insights.GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $223 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $198 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $25 million, or 13%. The increase was primarily due to $20 million in higher employee-related costs due to higher headcount, and $3 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal, and audit.Non-GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $215 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $135 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $80 million, or 59%. The increase was primarily due to increases in outside services expenses, additional employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, and one-time transaction and integration-related costs due to the acquisition of Adaptive Insights.Non-GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $135 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $117 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $18 million, or 15%. The increase was primarily due to $14 million in higher employee-related costs due to higher headcount, and $3 million in higher professional services costs including consulting, legal, and audit.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.Operating MarginsGAAP operating margins declined from (14.1)% for fiscal 2018 to (16.4)% for fiscal 2019. The reduction in our GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher share-based compensation and other operating expenses related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition, including one-time transaction and integration-related costs, offset by higher revenues.GAAP operating margins improved from (22.4)% for fiscal 2017 to (14.1)% for fiscal 2018. The improvement in our GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues, and improvements in operating leverage. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating margins to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating margins reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. We also believe that non-GAAP operating margins provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.34Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating margins are calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Non-GAAP operating margins improved from 10.1% for fiscal 2018 to 10.3% for fiscal 2019. The improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher revenues, offset by higher operating expenses related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition, including one-time transaction and integration-related costs.Non-GAAP operating margins improved from 3.3% for fiscal 2017 to 10.1% for fiscal 2018. The improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription services revenues, higher professional services revenues, and improvements in operating leverage.

The increase in other income, net for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was caused by an increase in other income of $50 million primarily related to the net gain from our equity investments and an increase in interest income of $17 million. This was offset by an increase in interest expense of $16 million primarily related to the 0.25% convertible senior notes issued in September 2017.The decrease in other expense, net for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was caused by an increase in interest income of $14 million, a decrease in non-marketable equity investment impairment of $14 million, and an increase in other income of $6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $14 million.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, sales of equity securities, and issuance of debt. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing of construction of facilities in Pleasanton, California and the acquisition of additional facilities, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our services, and acquisition activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing.35Table of ContentsOur cash flows for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2019 2018 2017 *As AdjustedNet cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$606,658 $465,727 $350,626Investing activities(842,784) (978,980) (168,885)Financing activities(256,711) 1,106,262 59,681Effect of exchange rate changes(614) 751 385Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(493,451) $593,760 $241,807*See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $607 million, $466 million, and $351 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The improvements in cash flows provided by operating activities in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 compared to prior fiscal years resulted primarily from increased sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 was $843 million, which was primarily the result of a net cash outflow of $1.4 billion related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $203 million, capital expenditures related to the construction of our development center of $160 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $43 million. These payments were partially offset by the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds of $950 million from the sale of marketable securities, and proceeds of $18 million from the sales and maturities of non-marketable equity and other investments. The sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2019 was primarily to fund the Adaptive Insights acquisition.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 was $979 million, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, capital expenditures for owned real estate projects (including construction of our development center) of $125 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $142 million, purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $16 million, purchases of other non-acquisition related intangible assets of $11 million, and a net cash outflow of $6 million related to an acquisition. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $244 million from the sale of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was $169 million, which was primarily the result of the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, a net cash outflow of $148 million related to acquisitions, purchases of office buildings and land in Pleasanton, California for $62 million, capital expenditures for owned real estate projects (including construction of our development center) of $45 million, and capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $121 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $133 million from the sale of marketable securities and $5 million from the sales and maturities of non-marketable equity and other investments.We expect capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects, including construction of our development center, will be approximately $130 million for fiscal 2020. We expect capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects, will be approximately $280 million for fiscal 2020. We expect that these capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2019, cash used in financing activities was $257 million, which was primarily due to the principal payment of $350 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes, offset by $94 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.For fiscal 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion, which was primarily due to the issuance of $1.15 billion principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022, net of issuance costs of $18 million, and the related sale of warrants for $81 million and purchase of note hedges for $176 million. For further information, see Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. In addition, cash flows from financing activities included $69 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.36Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $60 million, primarily as a result of $58 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margin meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating MarginsWe define non-GAAP operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. Similarly, the same components are also excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP operating margins. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. •Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margin is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses and Results of Operations—Operating Margins for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating margins, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins, for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. 37Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2019 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (1)$250,000 $— $250,000 $— $—0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (1)1,150,000 — — 1,150,000 —Aggregate interest obligation (2)16,008 6,625 7,458 1,925 —Operating lease obligations: Facilities space, not including related party (3)273,906 64,364 95,916 60,173 53,453Facilities space with related party90,619 12,972 32,740 31,297 13,610Computing infrastructure platform obligations77,667 10,667 28,000 39,000 —Contractual commitments77,399 18,479 25,498 33,422 —Total$1,935,599 $113,107 $439,612 $1,315,817 $67,063(1) Represents aggregate principal amount of the Notes, without the effect of associated discounts.(2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash.(3) For the 95-year lease we entered in January 2014, the cash obligations exclude the potential annual rental increases based on the increases to the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). We believe it is likely we will make higher rent payments over the lease term due to future changes in the CPI.Our contractual obligations primarily consist of our convertible senior notes, as well as obligations under leases for office space, co-location facilities for data center capacity, and computing infrastructure platforms for business operations. For fiscal 2020, we anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In addition, our existing lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. We expect our future operating lease obligations will increase as we expand our operations.We are not required to make principal payments under the Notes prior to maturity. If the Notes are not converted to Class A common stock prior to their maturity dates, we are required to repay $250 million in principal on July 15, 2020 and $1.15 billion in principal on October 1, 2022. We are also required to make interest payments on a semi-annual basis at the interest rates described in Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.In January 2014, we entered into a 95-year lease for a 6.9 acre parcel of land in Pleasanton, California, under which we paid $2 million for base rent from commencement through December 31, 2020. Annual rent payments of $0.2 million plus increases based on increases in the CPI begin on January 1, 2021 and continue through the end of the lease. Our new development center, consisting of approximately 410,000 square feet of office space, is being constructed on this property. The agreement with the contractor for the construction of the development center is not included in the table above because it allows for termination without significant penalty. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.38Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligationSubscription Services RevenuesSubscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our cloud applications for finance, human resources, planning, and analytics, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts are generally three years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues primarily consist of fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. The majority of our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.Contracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.39Table of ContentsConvertible Senior NotesIn June 2013, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”) with a principal amount of $350 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Concurrently in June 2013, we issued 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020 (“2020 Notes”) with a principal amount of $250 million. In September 2017, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022 (“2022 Notes”) with a principal amount of $1.15 billion (together with the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes, referred to as the “Notes”). In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital.Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets. We test for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.40Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018, our most significant currency exposures were the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. For further information, see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion and $3.3 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held primarily for working capital purposes. Our investment portfolios are managed to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of debt securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized in income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.An immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $5 million and $10 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. An immediate decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would have increased the market value by $5 million and $10 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities before maturity.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2013, we completed an offering of $350 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. In June 2013, concurrent with the 2018 Notes offering, we issued $250 million of 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020. In September 2017, we completed an offering of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022. Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election.Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes.The 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 1.50% and 0.25%, respectively, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes. However, the values of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying values of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes were $233 million and $972 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2019. These represent the liability component of the principal balance of our 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes as of January 31, 2019. The total estimated fair values of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes as of January 31, 2019 were $557 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. The fair values were determined based on the quoted bid prices of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last trading day for fiscal 2019, which were $222.85 and $135.67, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors.”The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations covers fiscal 2020 and 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and 2019. Discussions of fiscal 2018 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019, that was filed with the SEC on March 18, 2019.OverviewFounded in 2005, Workday delivers financial management, human capital management, planning, and analytics applications designed for the world’s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. We help organizations better manage their financial and human capital resources with one system that helps enable them to plan, execute, analyze, and extend — all powered by machine learning. Our diverse customer base includes medium and large, global companies, as well as smaller organizations that primarily use our planning product. Our cycle of frequent updates has facilitated rapid innovation and the introduction of new applications throughout our history. We began offering our HCM application in 2006 and our Financial Management application in 2007. Since then we have continued to invest in innovation and have consistently introduced new services to our customers, including through the acquisition of Adaptive Insights in fiscal 2019, and Scout RFP in fiscal 2020.We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we are incurring losses today, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. We offer Workday applications to our customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis, typically with contract terms of three years or longer and with subscription fees largely based on the size of the customer’s workforce. We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. We currently derive a substantial majority of our subscription services revenues from subscriptions to our HCM application. We market our applications primarily through our direct sales force.Our operating expenses have increased significantly in absolute dollars in recent periods, primarily due to the significant growth of our employee population. We had approximately 12,200 and approximately 10,500 employees as of January 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decrease over time as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring, building and/or leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center capacity as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to service our growing customer base. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. We expect to continue making such acquisitions and investments in the future, and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the industry. While we remain focused on improving operating margins, these acquisitions and investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near-term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and could make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently. 29Table of ContentsSince inception, we have also invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional service partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect that the rate of professional services revenue growth will decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth. Components of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe primarily derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services fees include deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenues accounted for 85% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020, and represented 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2020. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications. The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services revenues are recognized over time as they are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue. Our consulting engagements are generally billed on a time and materials basis or fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As our professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect these partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect our professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses related to hosting our applications and providing customer support, the costs of data center capacity, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, the costs of subcontractors, and travel expenses.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing the functionality, and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and are deferred and amortized. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related costs for finance and accounting, legal, human resources, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.30Table of ContentsResults of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202020192018Subscription services$3,096,389 $2,385,769 $1,787,833 Professional services530,817 436,411 355,217 Total revenues$3,627,206 $2,822,180 $2,143,050 Total revenues were $3.6 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $2.8 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.8 billion, or 29%. Subscription services revenues were $3.1 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $2.4 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 30%. The increase in subscription services revenues was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenues were $531 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $436 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $95 million, or 22%. The increase in professional services revenues was due primarily to Workday performing deployment and integration services for a greater number of customers than in the prior year period. Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $3.3 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.8 billion, or 26%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP operating expenses are calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses, and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.1 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $2.5 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.6 billion, or 24%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2020 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpenses (1)OtherOperatingExpenses (2)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (3)Costs of subscription services$488,513 $(49,919) $(40,326) $398,268 Costs of professional services576,745 (80,401) (6,440) 489,904 Product development1,549,906 (434,188) (30,684) 1,085,034 Sales and marketing1,146,548 (176,758) (40,774) 929,016 General and administrative367,724 (118,614) (8,592) 240,518 Total costs and expenses$4,129,436 $(859,880) $(126,816) $3,142,740 31Table of Contents Year Ended January 31, 2019 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpenses (1)OtherOperatingExpenses (2)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (3)Costs of subscription services$379,877 $(36,754) $(31,395) $311,728 Costs of professional services455,073 (55,535) (3,653) 395,885 Product development1,211,832 (320,876) (21,230) 869,726 Sales and marketing891,345 (132,810) (19,725) 738,810 General and administrative347,337 (127,443) (5,120) 214,774 Total costs and expenses$3,285,464 $(673,418) $(81,123) $2,530,923 Year Ended January 31, 2018 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpenses (1)OtherOperatingExpenses (2)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (3)Costs of subscription services$273,461 $(26,280) $(7,043) $240,138 Costs of professional services355,952 (37,592) (2,045) 316,315 Product development910,584 (229,819) (23,128) 657,637 Sales and marketing683,367 (100,762) (4,567) 578,038 General and administrative222,909 (83,972) (3,614) 135,323 Total costs and expenses$2,446,273 $(478,425) $(40,397) $1,927,451 (1)Share-based compensation expenses were $860 million, $673 million, and $478 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in share-based compensation expenses includes the impact of restricted stock units granted to existing and new employees and assumed Adaptive Insights awards.(2)Other operating expenses include employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions of $55 million, $32 million, and $21 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In addition, other operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $72 million, $49 million, and $19 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. (3)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Costs of Subscription ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $489 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $380 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $109 million, or 29%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $34 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, $31 million in depreciation and amortization expense including amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and $25 million in third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $398 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $312 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $86 million, or 28%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $25 million in third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, $23 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, and $20 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our data center capacity and operations.Costs of Professional ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $577 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $455 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $122 million, or 27%. The increase was primarily due to additional costs to staff deployment and integration engagements.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $490 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $396 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $94 million, or 24%. The increase was primarily due to additional costs to staff deployment and integration engagements.Going forward, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we continue to rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate GAAP and non-GAAP professional services margins to be lower than fiscal 2020, as we invest in programs to ensure ongoing customer success.32Table of ContentsProduct DevelopmentGAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 28%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $0.9 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 25%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and MarketingGAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $0.9 billion for fiscal 2019, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 29%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume.Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $929 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $739 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $190 million, or 26%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and higher commissionable sales volume.We expect that GAAP and non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in the expansion of our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to build brand awareness and attract new customers.General and AdministrativeGAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $368 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $347 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $21 million, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $23 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $9 million in facility and IT-related expenses, partially offset by one-time transaction and integration-related costs related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition incurred in the prior year that did not recur in the current year.Non-GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $241 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $215 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $26 million, or 12%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $28 million in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount and $9 million in facility and IT-related expenses, partially offset by one-time transaction and integration-related costs related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition incurred in the prior year that did not recur in the current year.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.Operating MarginsGAAP operating margins improved from (16.4)% for fiscal 2019, to (13.8)% for fiscal 2020. The improvement in our GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription and professional services revenues and the absence of prior year costs attributable to the Adaptive Insights acquisition that did not recur in the current year.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating margins to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating margins reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating margins provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.Non-GAAP operating margins are calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.33Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating margins improved from 10.3% for fiscal 2019, to 13.4% for fiscal 2020. The improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin was primarily due to higher subscription and professional services revenues and the absence of prior year costs attributable to the Adaptive Insights acquisition that did not recur in the current year.Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating margins were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2020 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP Operating Expenses (1)Operating margin(13.8)%23.7 %3.5 %13.4 % Year Ended January 31, 2019 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP Operating Expenses (1)Operating margin(16.4)%23.8 %2.9 %10.3 % Year Ended January 31, 2018 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP Operating Expenses (1)Operating margin(14.1)%22.3 %1.9 %10.1 %(1)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetWe had other income, net of $20 million and $40 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $12 million of other expense, net in 2018. The decrease in other income, net for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency gains associated with our foreign currency forward contracts that was attributable to the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and the decrease in net gains from our equity investments of $8 million. Refer to Note 10, Derivatives for further information regarding the impact of adopting ASU No. 2017-12 and to Note 3, Investments for further information regarding equity investments.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating MarginsOur non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins exclude the components listed below. For the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. 34Table of Contents•Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See “Results of Operations—Operating Expenses and Results of Operations—Operating Margins” for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating margins, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins, for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds.We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, sales of equity investments, and issuance of debt. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our customer growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing of construction of facilities in Pleasanton, California and the acquisition of additional facilities, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our services, and acquisition and investment activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, employee teams, services, technologies, or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional equity or debt financing.Our cash flows for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202020192018Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$864,598 $606,658 $465,727 Investing activities(896,922) (842,784) (978,980) Financing activities125,124 (256,711) 1,106,262 Effect of exchange rate changes(282) (614) 751 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$92,518 $(493,451) $593,760 35Table of ContentsOperating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $865 million, $607 million, and $466 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The improvement in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020, compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily the result of increased sales and the related cash collections, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020, was $897 million, which was primarily the result of a net cash outflow related to acquisition activity of $474 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $244 million, capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects of $99 million, purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $25 million, and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $57 million from sales of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019, was $843 million, which was primarily the result of a net cash outflow of $1.4 billion related to acquisition activity, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $203 million, capital expenditures related to the construction of our development center of $160 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $43 million. These payments were partially offset by the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities, proceeds of $950 million from the sale of marketable securities, and proceeds of $18 million from the sales and maturities of non-marketable equity and other investments. The sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2019, was primarily to fund the Adaptive Insights acquisition. We expect capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects will be approximately $230 million for fiscal 2021. We expect capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects, will be approximately $350 million for fiscal 2021. These capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth. Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $125 million, which was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.For fiscal 2019, cash used in financing activities was $257 million, which was primarily due to the principal payment of $350 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes, offset by $94 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations as of January 31, 2020 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period TotalLess than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore than 5 Years1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (1)$249,945 $249,945 $— $— $— 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (1)1,150,000 — 1,150,000 — — Aggregate interest obligation (2)9,380 4,580 4,800 — — Operating leases (3)347,815 75,003 135,154 91,678 45,980 Third-party hosted infrastructure platform obligations472,459 40,375 80,000 80,000 272,084 Contractual commitments (4)145,669 87,814 32,045 25,810 — Total$2,375,268 $457,717 $1,401,999 $197,488 $318,064 (1)Represents the aggregate principal amount of these notes, without the effect of associated discounts.(2)Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding Notes that are payable in cash.(3)Represents total lease payments based on contractual terms, excluding total imputed interest of $40 million.(4)Includes a $50 million commitment as of January 31, 2020, to fund an ownership interest in a limited partnership, which was paid in February 2020.Our contractual obligations primarily consist of our convertible senior notes, as well as obligations under leases for office space, co-location facilities for data center capacity, and third-party hosted infrastructure platforms for business operations. 36Table of ContentsWe are not required to make principal payments under the Notes prior to maturity. If the Notes are not converted to Class A common stock prior to their maturity dates, we are required to repay $250 million in principal on July 15, 2020, and $1.15 billion in principal on October 1, 2022. We are also required to make interest payments on a semi-annual basis at the interest rates described in Note 11, Convertible Senior Notes, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We anticipate leasing additional office space near our headquarters and in various other locations around the world to support our growth. In addition, our existing lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. We expect our future operating lease obligations to increase as we expand our operations.Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and operating results.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligationSubscription Services RevenuesSubscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our cloud applications for finance, human resources, planning, and analytics, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts are generally three years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and non-cancelable.Professional Services RevenuesProfessional services revenues primarily consist of consulting fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. Our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed.37Table of ContentsContracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.Convertible Senior NotesIn June 2013, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with a principal amount of $350 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Concurrently in June 2013, we issued 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020 (“2020 Notes”), with a principal amount of $250 million. In September 2017, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022 (“2022 Notes”), with a principal amount of $1.15 billion (together with the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes, referred to as the “Notes”). In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital.Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets. We test for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.38Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2020, our most significant currency exposures were the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Australian dollar. Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. For further information, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held primarily for working capital purposes. Our investment portfolios are managed to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of debt securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized in income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary.An immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $7 million and $5 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities before maturity.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2013, we completed an offering of $350 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 (“2018 Notes”). In June 2013, concurrent with the 2018 Notes offering, we issued $250 million of 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020 (“2020 Notes”). In September 2017, we completed an offering of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022 (“2022 Notes”) (together with the 2020 Notes, referred to as the “Outstanding Notes,” and together with the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes, referred to as the “Notes”).Holders may convert the Outstanding Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, holders of the Outstanding Notes will receive cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at our election.Concurrently with the issuance of Notes, we entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of these Notes.The 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 1.50% and 0.25%, respectively, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Outstanding Notes. However, the values of the Outstanding Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of the Outstanding Notes are affected by our stock price. The carrying values of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes were $244 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, as of January 31, 2020. The carrying values represent the liability components of the principal balances of the Outstanding Notes as of January 31, 2020. The estimated fair values of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes were $571 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, as of January 31, 2020. The estimated fair values were determined based on the quoted bid prices of the 2020 Notes and 2022 Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last trading day for fiscal 2020, which were $228.47 and $138.09, respectively.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations covers fiscal 2021 and 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, that was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2020.OverviewWorkday delivers financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics and benchmarking applications designed for the world’s largest companies, educational institutions, and government agencies. With Workday, our customers have a unified system that can help them plan, execute, analyze, and extend to other applications and environments, thereby helping them continuously adapt how they manage their businesses and operations. Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global companies within numerous industry categories, including technology, financial services, business and professional services, healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, retail, and hospitality, as well as educational institutions, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations.We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time, with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding our customer base. While we have incurred net losses on a GAAP basis in each period since our inception in 2005, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease over the longer term as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs.We plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenues in future periods to grow our business. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring and leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center capacity and equipment as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to support our growing customer base.We regularly evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. For example, we acquired Adaptive Insights in fiscal 2019 and Scout in fiscal 2020, and we recently announced our intent to acquire Peakon in fiscal 2022. We expect to continue making such acquisitions and investments in the future. While we remain focused on improving operating margins, these acquisitions and investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and could make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.Since inception, we have also invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional service partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect the rate of professional services revenue growth to decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth.37Table of ContentsImpact of the COVID-19 PandemicIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease was reported, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. In response to COVID-19, we have temporarily closed the majority of our offices; required most of our employees to work remotely; implemented travel restrictions; and postponed certain of our customer, industry, implementation partner, analyst, investor, and employee events and converted others to virtual-only experiences. Despite the economic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are confident in the long-term overall health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy.The COVID-19 pandemic created uncertainty in most industries and impacted our ability to generate new business during fiscal 2021. Despite this, we achieved solid new subscription bookings as demand for our products remained strong. Our operating margins for fiscal 2021 have been favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing headcount growth as well as the moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not anticipate the extent of the favorable margin impact experienced during fiscal 2021 to continue long-term as we remain committed to investing in our business to drive top line growth and to support our customer base.Our near-term revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model. However, if the economic uncertainty persists, we may continue to experience a negative impact on new business, customer renewals, sales and marketing efforts, revenue growth rates, customer deployments, customer solvency, product development, or other financial metrics, any of which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Components of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services revenue includes fees for deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenue accounted for 88% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021, and represented 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2021. Subscription services revenue is driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications.The mix of the applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services revenue is recognized over time as services are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally noncancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue.Our consulting engagements are generally billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As our professional services organization and the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continue to develop, we expect these partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenue, we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenues to decline over time.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenue. Costs of subscription services revenue consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with hosting our applications and providing customer support, data center expenses, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.38Table of ContentsCosts of professional services revenue. Costs of professional services revenue consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, subcontractor expenses, and travel expenses.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing functionality, and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand awareness, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and are deferred and amortized. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.Results of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202120202019Subscription services$3,788,452 $3,096,389 $2,385,769 Professional services529,544 530,817 436,411 Total revenues$4,317,996 $3,627,206 $2,822,180 Total revenues were $4.3 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $3.6 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $691 million, or 19%. Subscription services revenue was $3.8 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $692 million, or 22%. The increase in subscription services revenue was due primarily to an increased number of customer contracts as compared to the prior year. Professional services revenue was $530 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $531 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $1 million, or 0.2%. The decrease in professional services revenue was primarily due to decreases in training revenue and reimbursable travel expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by increased professional services revenue due to Workday performing deployment and integration services for a greater number of customers.Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $4.6 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $4.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $437 million, or 11%. The increase in GAAP operating expenses included increases of $329 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $79 million related to a one-time cash bonus paid to non-executive employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to help accommodate unforeseen costs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19 one-time employee bonus”), $46 million in facilities and IT related expenses, $31 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $21 million in charitable donations, partially offset by a decrease of $92 million from reduced travel.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.Non-GAAP operating expenses are calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. 39Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating expenses were $3.5 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $308 million, or 10%. The increase in non-GAAP operating expenses included increases of $187 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $79 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, $46 million in facilities and IT related expenses, $31 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $21 million in charitable donations, partially offset by a decrease of $92 million from reduced travel.Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2021 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpenses (1)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (2)Costs of subscription services$611,912 $(63,253)$(34,799)$513,860 Costs of professional services586,220 (101,869)(6,486)477,865 Product development1,721,222 (505,376)(27,567)1,188,279 Sales and marketing1,233,173 (202,819)(35,797)994,557 General and administrative414,068 (131,537)(6,337)276,194 Total costs and expenses$4,566,595 $(1,004,854)$(110,986)$3,450,755 Year Ended January 31, 2020 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpenses (1)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (2)Costs of subscription services$488,513 $(49,919)$(40,326)$398,268 Costs of professional services576,745 (80,401)(6,440)489,904 Product development1,549,906 (434,188)(30,684)1,085,034 Sales and marketing1,146,548 (176,758)(40,774)929,016 General and administrative367,724 (118,614)(8,592)240,518 Total costs and expenses$4,129,436 $(859,880)$(126,816)$3,142,740 Year Ended January 31, 2019 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpenses (1)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (2)Costs of subscription services$379,877 $(36,754)$(31,395)$311,728 Costs of professional services455,073 (55,535)(3,653)395,885 Product development1,211,832 (320,876)(21,230)869,726 Sales and marketing891,345 (132,810)(19,725)738,810 General and administrative347,337 (127,443)(5,120)214,774 Total costs and expenses$3,285,464 $(673,418)$(81,123)$2,530,923 (1)Other operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $60 million, $72 million, and $49 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $54 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $26 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, $20 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $18 million in facilities and IT related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $514 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $398 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $116 million, or 29%. The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $41 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $26 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, $20 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $18 million in facilities and IT related expenses.40Table of ContentsWe expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our technical operations infrastructure, including our data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties.Costs of Professional ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $586 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $577 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $9 million, or 2%. The increase in costs of professional services included increases of $28 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount and $12 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, offset by decreases of $16 million from reduced travel and $14 million in reduced subcontractor expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $478 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $490 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $12 million, or 2%. The decrease in costs of professional services included decreases of $16 million from reduced travel and $14 million in reduced subcontractor expenses, offset by an increase of $12 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we continue to rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow.Product DevelopmentGAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $171 million, or 11%. The increase in product development expenses included increases of $134 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount and $31 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $15 million from reduced travel.Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $103 million, or 10%. The increase in product development expenses included increases of $64 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount and $31 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $15 million from reduced travel.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and MarketingGAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $1.2 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, an increase of $87 million, or 8%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses included increases of $88 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $25 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, and $14 million related to marketing programs, partially offset by a decrease of $54 million from reduced travel.Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $995 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $929 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $66 million, or 7%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses included increases of $62 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $25 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, and $14 million related to marketing programs, partially offset by a decrease of $54 million from reduced travel.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to expand brand awareness and attract new customers.General and AdministrativeGAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $414 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $368 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $46 million, or 13%. The increase in general and administrative expenses included increases of $24 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, $21 million in charitable donations, and $6 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million from reduced travel.Non-GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $276 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $241 million for fiscal 2020, an increase of $36 million, or 15%. The increase in general and administrative expenses included increases of $21 million in charitable donations, $13 million in employee-related expenses driven by higher average headcount, and $6 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million from reduced travel.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.41Table of ContentsOperating MarginsGAAP operating margins improved from (13.8)% for fiscal 2020 to (5.8)% for fiscal 2021. Our GAAP operating margins for fiscal 2021 have been favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing headcount growth as well as moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced travel.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating margins to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating margins reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating margins provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.Non-GAAP operating margins are calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Non-GAAP operating margins improved from 13.4% for fiscal 2020 to 20.1% for fiscal 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal 2021 have been favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing headcount growth as well as moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced travel.Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating margins were as follows: Year Ended January 31, 2021 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP Operating Expenses (1)Operating margin(5.8)%23.3%2.6%20.1% Year Ended January 31, 2020 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP Operating Expenses (1)Operating margin(13.8)%23.7%3.5%13.4% Year Ended January 31, 2019 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP Operating Expenses (1)Operating margin(16.4)%23.8%2.9%10.3%(1)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetWe had other expense, net of $27 million during fiscal 2021, as compared to other income, net of $20 million and $40 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.The decrease of $46 million in other income, net for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a decrease of $22 million in interest income on marketable securities from lower prevailing interest rates, a $20 million non-cash gain on our existing Scout investment recorded in prior year as part of the Scout acquisition, and an increase of $10 million in interest expense related to debt. The decrease was offset by an unrealized gain of $14 million on marketable equity investments in the current fiscal year.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.42Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Operating Expenses and Non-GAAP Operating MarginsOur non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins exclude the components listed below. For the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. •Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of our ongoing operations.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See “Results of Operations—Operating Expenses” and “Results of Operations—Operating Margins” for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP operating margins, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margins, for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.5 billion, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of, in order from largest to smallest, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. agency obligations, and corporate bonds. We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, issuance of debt, and sales of equity securities. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to the remaining term of contracted noncancelable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility that provides for $750 million of unsecured financing, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.43Table of ContentsOur long-term future capital requirements depend on many factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, customer growth rates, subscription renewal activity, timing and extent of development efforts, expansion of sales and marketing activities, introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, timing of construction or acquisition of additional facilities, investments, and acquisition activities. We may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, or intellectual property rights in the future. We also may choose to seek additional debt or equity financing.Our cash flows for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202120202019Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$1,268,441 $864,598 $606,658 Investing activities(1,241,624)(896,922)(842,784)Financing activities625,049 125,124 (256,711)Effect of exchange rate changes1,334 (282)(614)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$653,200 $92,518 $(493,451)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion, $865 million, and $607 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The improvement in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021, compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to increases in sales and related cash collections as well as moderation of operating expenses related to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher cash operating expenses driven by higher average headcount.We expect our business to continue to generate sufficient operating cash flows; however, if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or is prolonged, our customers may continue to request payment timing concessions, which could materially impact the timing and predictability of our operating cash flows in any given period.Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 was $1.2 billion, which was primarily comprised of a net cash outflow related to purchases and maturities of marketable securities of $930 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $253 million, and purchases of non-marketable investments of $67 million.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2020 was $897 million, which was primarily comprised of a net cash outflow related to acquisition activity of $474 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $244 million, capital expenditures related to owned real estate projects of $99 million, purchases of non-marketable investments of $25 million, and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $57 million from sales of marketable securities.We expect capital expenditures for owned real estate projects to be approximately $170 million for fiscal 2022. This capital outlay is related to the purchase of the leased properties discussed in Note 12, Leases, and Note 22, Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect capital expenditures, excluding owned real estate projects, to be approximately $270 million for fiscal 2022. These capital outlays will largely be used to expand the infrastructure of our data centers and to build out additional office space to support our growth.Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $625 million, which was primarily comprised of net proceeds of $748 million from borrowing on the Term Loan and $149 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by the principal payment of $250 million in connection with the conversion of the 2020 Notes.For fiscal 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $125 million, which was primarily comprised of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.44Table of ContentsOur 2022 Notes became convertible at the option of the holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, and they continue to be convertible in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 since the trigger for early conversion was met. Through the date of this filing, the amount of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes that has been converted or for which conversion has been requested was not material. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement during fiscal 2022. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations primarily consist of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, our convertible senior notes, leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity, and agreements for third-party hosted infrastructure platforms for business operations. As of January 31, 2021, our principal contractual cash obligations consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments Due by Period TotalLess than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore than 5 YearsTerm Loan (1)$768,608 $48,365 $167,631 $552,612 $— 0.25% Convertible senior notes due 2022 (2)1,154,734 2,875 1,151,859 — — Operating leases (3)482,439 100,678 170,599 115,484 95,678 Third-party hosted infrastructure platform obligations423,730 41,000 91,000 291,730 — Purchase obligations (4)323,144 194,892 86,284 41,968 — Total$3,152,655 $387,810 $1,667,373 $1,001,794 $95,678 (1)Consists of principal and interest payments on the Term Loan. The interest obligation on the Term Loan included in the table above assumes interest rates consistent with those in effect for our Term Loan as of January 31, 2021. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2)Consists of principal and interest payments on the 2022 Notes. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(3)We have entered into operating lease agreements for our office space, data centers, and other property and equipment with various expiration dates. These lease agreements often provide us with an option to renew. The amounts in the table above represent total lease payments based on contractual terms, excluding total imputed interest of $39 million.(4)The purchase obligations in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. Additionally, purchase orders are not included in the table above since they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and operating results.45Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for services rendered.We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•Determination of the transaction price;•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Subscription Services RevenueSubscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our cloud applications for financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics, with routine customer support. Revenue is generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts are generally three years or longer in length, billed annually in advance, and are generally noncancelable.Professional Services RevenueProfessional services revenue primarily consists of consulting fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. Our consulting contracts are billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenue is recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed.Contracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.46Table of ContentsConvertible Senior NotesIn June 2013, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2018 (“2018 Notes”), with a principal amount of $350 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Concurrently, in June 2013, we issued 1.50% convertible senior notes due July 15, 2020, with a principal amount of $250 million, which were subsequently converted by note holders during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In September 2017, we issued 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022, with a principal amount of $1.15 billion (together with the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes, referred to as the “Notes”). In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, we separated each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amounts of the liability components were calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option were determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Notes. These differences represent debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to the liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate method, to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in Additional paid-in capital.Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsAccounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. We allocate the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, expected asset useful lives, royalty rates, and discount rates. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assessing the recoverability of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets. We test for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.47Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in negative impacts on global economies and financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2021, our most significant currency exposures were the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Australian dollar. Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. For further information, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate Risk on our InvestmentsWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.5 billion and $1.9 billion as of January 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market funds. The cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held primarily for working capital purposes. Our investment portfolios are managed to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of debt securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. Our debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale.” When the fair value of the security declines below its amortized cost basis, any portion of that decline attributable to credit losses, to the extent expected to be nonrecoverable before the sale of the impaired security, is recognized on the consolidated statement of operations.An immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $10 million and $7 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Interest Rate Risk on our DebtIn April 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement pursuant to which the lenders would extend to Workday a senior unsecured Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million. The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.000% to 0.625%, or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the London interbank market plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.625%. The base rate is defined as the greatest of (i) Bank of America’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the London interbank market for a period of one month (but not less than zero) plus 1.00%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our consolidated leverage ratio.As of January 31, 2021, the Term Loan had a carrying value of $729 million and there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.38% as of January 31, 2021.Because the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement are variable, we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affect our cost of borrowing. A hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations.48Table of ContentsIn September 2017, we completed an offering of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022. The 2022 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 2022 Notes. However, the value of the 2022 Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of the 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2022 Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of the 2022 Notes was $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2021. The carrying value represents the liability component of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes as of January 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of the 2022 Notes was $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2021. The estimated fair value was determined based on the quoted bid price of the 2022 Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last trading day for fiscal 2021, which was $159.87.For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:05.965506

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations covers fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, that was filed with the SEC on March 2, 2021.OverviewWorkday delivers applications for financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics. With Workday, our customers have a unified system that can help them plan, execute, analyze, and extend to other applications and environments, thereby helping them continuously adapt how they manage their business and operations. Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global organizations within numerous industry categories, including professional and business services, financial services, healthcare, education, government, technology, media, retail, and hospitality.We have achieved significant growth since our inception in 2005, with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding both our customer base and our footprint within our existing customers. While we have a history of GAAP operating losses, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease over the longer term as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs.We plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenues in future periods to grow our business. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications, enhance existing applications, and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pacific, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of local markets, increasing our sales and marketing organizations, acquiring and leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center capacity and equipment and third-party hosted infrastructure platforms as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to support our growing customer base.We regularly evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. For example, we acquired Peakon, Zimit, and VNDLY in fiscal 2022, and Scout in fiscal 2020. We expect to continue making such acquisitions and investments in the future. While we remain focused on improving operating margin, these acquisitions and investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and could make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.Since inception, we have also invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect the rate of professional services revenue growth to decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth.37Table of ContentsImpact of the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic is having unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed the majority of our offices; required most of our employees to work remotely; implemented travel restrictions; and postponed certain of our customer, industry, implementation partner, analyst, investor, and employee events and converted others to virtual-only experiences. Most of these operational changes remain in effect and we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners. While the majority of our employees continue to work remotely, we began to reopen our offices in fiscal 2022 and are allowing employees to return to the office on a voluntary basis with enhanced safety protocols in place.Despite the continuing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to achieve solid new subscription bookings as demand for our products remains strong, and we are confident in the long-term overall health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy. Our operating margin in fiscal 2022 and 2021 was favorably impacted by the moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not anticipate the extent of the favorable margin impact to continue long-term as we remain committed to investing in our business to drive top line growth and to support our customer base.Our near-term revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model. However, if the economic uncertainty increases, we may experience a negative impact on new business, customer renewals, sales and marketing efforts, revenue growth rates, customer deployments, customer solvency, product development, or other financial metrics, similar to what we experienced at the onset of the pandemic. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Financial Results OverviewThe following table provides an overview of our key metrics (in thousands, except percentages and headcount data): As of and for the Years Ended January 31, 20222021$ Change% ChangeTotal revenues$5,138,798 $4,317,996 $820,802 19 %Subscription services revenues$4,546,313 $3,788,452 $757,861 20 %Total subscription revenue backlog$12,806,855 $10,088,634 $2,718,221 27 %24-month subscription revenue backlog$7,975,554 $6,526,074 $1,449,480 22 %GAAP operating income (loss)$(116,450)$(248,599)$132,149 (53)%Non-GAAP operating income (1)$1,149,704 $867,241 $282,463 33 %GAAP operating margin(2.3)%(5.8)%4 %Non-GAAP operating margin (1)22.4 %20.1 %2 %Operating cash flows$1,650,704 $1,268,441 $382,263 30 %Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$3,644,161 $3,535,653 $108,508 3 %Headcount15,204 12,524 2,680 21 %(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.38Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services revenues include fees for deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenues accounted for 88% of our total revenues during fiscal 2022, and represented 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2022. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications.The mix of applications to which a customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services revenues are recognized over time as services are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally noncancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue.Our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenues are recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenues are recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continues to develop, we expect these partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers. As a result of this trend, and the increase of our subscription services revenues, we expect our professional services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline over time.Subscription Revenue BacklogOur subscription revenue backlog, which is also referred to as remaining performance obligations for subscription contracts, represents contracted subscription services revenues that have not yet been recognized and includes billed and unbilled amounts. Subscription revenue backlog may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including the timing of renewals and overall renewal rates, new business growth, average contract duration, and seasonality.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with hosting our applications and providing customer support, expenses related to data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, subcontractor expenses, and travel expenses.Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and applications, increasing functionality, and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand awareness, brand ambassador campaigns, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, human resources, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.39Table of ContentsResults of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202220212020Subscription services$4,546,313 $3,788,452 $3,096,389 Professional services592,485 529,544 530,817 Total revenues$5,138,798 $4,317,996 $3,627,206 Total revenues were $5.1 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $821 million, or 19%. Subscription services revenues were $4.5 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $758 million, or 20%. The increase in subscription services revenues was primarily due to an increased number of customer contracts and strong customer renewals, with gross retention over 95%. Professional services revenues were $592 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $530 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $63 million, or 12%. The increase in professional services revenues was primarily due to Workday performing deployment and integration services for a greater number of customers.Subscription Revenue BacklogAs of January 31, 2022, our total subscription revenue backlog was $12.8 billion, with $8.0 billion expected to be recognized in revenues over the next 24 months. As of January 31, 2021, our total subscription revenue backlog was $10.1 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be recognized in revenues over the next 24 months. The increase in subscription revenue backlog during fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion of our product offerings with existing customers, and the timing of renewals.Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $5.3 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $4.6 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $689 million, or 15%, which was primarily related to an increase of $517 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, due to higher average headcount. The increase in employee-related expenses also included $32 million for a performance-based cash bonus program that was expanded to all employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Additionally, there were increases of $59 million related to marketing programs, $51 million in professional services and subcontractor expenses, $44 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $37 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, offset by a decrease of $79 million related to a one-time cash bonus that had been paid in fiscal 2021 to non-executive employees to help accommodate unforeseen costs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19 one-time employee bonus”).We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating expenses reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating expenses provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.Non-GAAP operating expenses were calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.0 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $3.5 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $538 million, or 16%, which was primarily related to an increase of $385 million in employee-related expenses due to higher average headcount. The increase in employee-related expenses also included $32 million for a performance-based cash bonus program that was expanded to all employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Additionally, there were increases of $59 million related to marketing programs, $51 million in professional services and subcontractor expenses, $44 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $37 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, offset by a decrease of $79 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.40Table of ContentsReconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating expenses were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 2022 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpenses (1)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (2)Costs of subscription services$795,854 $(85,713)$(54,551)$655,590 Costs of professional services632,241 (113,443)(11,181)507,617 Product development1,879,220 (543,135)(32,935)1,303,150 Sales and marketing1,461,921 (215,692)(47,457)1,198,772 General and administrative486,012 (154,422)(7,625)323,965 Total costs and expenses$5,255,248 $(1,112,405)$(153,749)$3,989,094 Year Ended January 31, 2021 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpenses (1)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (2)Costs of subscription services$611,912 $(63,253)$(34,799)$513,860 Costs of professional services586,220 (101,869)(6,486)477,865 Product development1,721,222 (505,376)(27,567)1,188,279 Sales and marketing1,233,173 (202,819)(35,797)994,557 General and administrative414,068 (131,537)(6,337)276,194 Total costs and expenses$4,566,595 $(1,004,854)$(110,986)$3,450,755 Year Ended January 31, 2020 GAAP Operating ExpensesShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpenses (1)Non-GAAP Operating Expenses (2)Costs of subscription services$488,513 $(49,919)$(40,326)$398,268 Costs of professional services576,745 (80,401)(6,440)489,904 Product development1,549,906 (434,188)(30,684)1,085,034 Sales and marketing1,146,548 (176,758)(40,774)929,016 General and administrative367,724 (118,614)(8,592)240,518 Total costs and expenses$4,129,436 $(859,880)$(126,816)$3,142,740 (1)Other operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $78 million, $60 million, and $72 million for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $91 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, due to higher average headcount, $37 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, and $28 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, offset by a decrease of $5 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $656 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $514 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $142 million, or 28%. The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $66 million in employee-related expenses due to higher average headcount, $37 million in depreciation expense related to equipment in our data centers, and $28 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, offset by a decrease of $5 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our technical operations infrastructure, including our data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties.41Table of ContentsCosts of Professional ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $632 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $586 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $46 million, or 8%. The increase in costs of professional services was primarily due to an increase of $54 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, due to higher average headcount, offset by a decrease of $12 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $508 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $478 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $30 million, or 6%. The increase in costs of professional services was primarily due to an increase of $38 million in employee-related expenses due to higher average headcount, offset by a decrease of $12 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we continue to rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow.Product DevelopmentGAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.9 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $158 million, or 9%. The increase in product development expenses was primarily due to an increase of $169 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, due to higher average headcount, offset by a decrease of $31 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.3 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $115 million, or 10%. The increase in product development expenses was primarily due to an increase of $122 million in employee-related expenses due to higher average headcount, offset by a decrease of $31 million related to the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and MarketingGAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2021, an increase of $229 million, or 19%.

Our GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2022 was favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing average headcount growth, moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the absence of the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus paid in the prior fiscal year.We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating margin to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP operating margin reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. We also believe that non-GAAP operating margin provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.Non-GAAP operating margin was calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Non-GAAP operating margin improved from 20.1% for fiscal 2021 to 22.4% for fiscal 2022. Our non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2022 was favorably impacted by our revenue growth outpacing average headcount growth, moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the absence of the COVID-19 one-time employee bonus paid in the prior fiscal year.Reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating income (loss) and operating margin were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended January 31, 2022 GAAPShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP (1)Operating income (loss)$(116,450)$1,112,405 $153,749 $1,149,704 Operating margin(2.3)%21.6 %3.1 %22.4 % Year Ended January 31, 2021 GAAPShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP (1)Operating income (loss)$(248,599)$1,004,854 $110,986 $867,241 Operating margin(5.8)%23.3 %2.6 %20.1 % Year Ended January 31, 2020 GAAPShare-BasedCompensationExpensesOtherOperatingExpensesNon-GAAP (1)Operating income (loss)$(502,230)$859,880 $126,816 $484,466 Operating margin(13.8)%23.7 %3.5 %13.4 %(1)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetWe had other income (expense), net of $133 million, $(27) million, and $20 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.The increase in other income, net for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily related to net gains of $124 million recognized on our equity investments, of which $83 million was due to an equity investment that completed its IPO during fiscal 2022. Additionally, there was a decrease in interest expense for our convertible senior notes of $52 million from the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-06 and the conversion of our 1.50% convertible senior notes (“2020 Notes”) in fiscal 2021, offset by a decrease of $13 million in interest income on marketable securities resulting from lower prevailing interest rates.43Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Operating MarginOur non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin exclude the components listed below. For the reasons set forth below, management believes that excluding the components provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. •Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of ongoing operations. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See “Results of Operations—Operating Expenses” and “Results of Operations—Operating Margin” for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, GAAP operating expenses, GAAP operating income (loss), and GAAP operating margin, to the non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin, for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.6 billion, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed primarily of, in order from largest to smallest, commercial paper, U.S. treasury securities, money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency obligations, and marketable equity investments. We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, issuance of debt, and sales of our common stock.44Table of ContentsWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to the remaining term of contracted noncancelable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility that provides for $750 million of unsecured financing, are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. As part of our strategy, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, or intellectual property rights in the future. We may also choose to seek additional debt or equity financing.Our long-term future capital requirements depend on many factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, customer growth rates, subscription renewal activity, headcount growth, timing and extent of development efforts, expansion of sales and marketing activities, introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, timing of construction or acquisition of additional facilities, investments, and acquisition activities.Our cash flows were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202220212020Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$1,650,704 $1,268,441 $864,598 Investing activities(1,607,426)(1,241,624)(896,922)Financing activities110,251 625,049 125,124 Effect of exchange rate changes(705)1,334 (282)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$152,824 $653,200 $92,518 Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The improvement in cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022, compared to the prior fiscal year, was primarily due to increases in sales and related cash collections and moderation of operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.We expect our business to continue to generate sufficient operating cash flows; however, if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or is prolonged, our customers may request payment timing concessions, which could materially impact the timing and predictability of our operating cash flows in any given period.Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 was $1.6 billion, which was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisitions of VNDLY, Zimit, and Peakon, net of cash acquired, of $1.2 billion. Cash used in investing activities also included capital expenditures of $264 million mainly for data center projects, the purchase of office space within our corporate headquarters of $171 million, purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $123 million, and the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $199 million from sales of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 was $1.2 billion, which was primarily comprised of a net cash outflow related to purchases and maturities of marketable securities of $930 million, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $253 million, and purchases of non-marketable investments of $67 million.We expect capital expenditures will be approximately $475 million in fiscal 2023. This includes investments in our office facilities, corporate IT infrastructure, and customer data centers to support our continued growth.Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $110 million, which was primarily due to proceeds of $148 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, offset by payments of $38 million on the Term Loan.For fiscal 2021, cash provided by financing activities was $625 million, which was primarily due to net proceeds of $748 million from borrowing on the Term Loan and $149 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, partially offset by the principal payment of $250 million in connection with the conversion of the 2020 Notes.45Table of ContentsOur 2022 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 since the trigger for early conversion was met. Through the date of this filing, the amount of the principal balance of the 2022 Notes that has been converted or for which conversion has been requested was not material. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations primarily consist of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, our convertible senior notes, leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity, agreements for third-party hosted infrastructure platforms for business operations, and other purchase obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. The table below includes our material contractual obligations, excluding imputed interest, as of January 31, 2022 (in thousands). For further information, see the associated Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report referenced in the table below.Payments Due by Period TotalShort-termLong-termReferenceTerm Loan (1)$716,489 $83,589 $632,900 Note 112022 Notes (1)1,152,700 1,152,700 — Note 11Operating leases288,598 85,578 203,020 Note 12Third-party hosted infrastructure platform obligations728,083 42,985 685,098 Note 13Other purchase obligations457,338 127,216 330,122 Note 13$3,343,208 $1,492,068 $1,851,140 (1)Consists of principal and interest payments on the Term Loan and 2022 Notes. The interest obligation on the Term Loan included in the table above assumes interest rates consistent with those in effect for our Term Loan as of January 31, 2022.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgements, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, judgements, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and operating results.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for services rendered.We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•Determination of the transaction price;•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•Recognition of revenues when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.46Table of ContentsWe believe the areas we apply the most critical judgements when determining revenue recognition relate to the identification of distinct performance obligations and the assessment of the standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation identified. Determination of Performance ObligationsA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Our contracts with customers may include multiple promises to transfer services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and the value delivered to the customer. Our primary performance obligations consist of subscription services and professional services. We satisfy these performance obligations over time as we transfer the promised services to our customers. Subscription services are made up of a daily requirement to deliver the service to the customer. Each day the delivery of the service provides value to the customer and each day represents a measure toward completion of the service. As such, subscription services meet the criteria to be a series of distinct services. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct as the professional services are not interrelated with subscription services nor do they result in significant customization of the subscription service. As such, we view professional services as a performance obligation to the customer. At contract inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We combine contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer if we determine that the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or the services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we assess each promise separately and allocate the transaction price on a relative standalone selling price basis. We apply significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition.Standalone Selling Price AssessmentWe determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the cloud applications sold, customer demographics, geographic locations, and the number and types of users within our contracts.We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for both subscription and professional services sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the performance obligations. Judgement is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. Our SSP ranges are reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Changes in SSP for our services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by market competition, changes in demand for our services, and other economic factors. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP and may therefore impact revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts are capitalized and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Periodically, we review whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. Any future changes in circumstances around the terms of our initial and renewal contracts, customer attrition, underlying technology life, and certain other factors may materially change the period of benefit and therefore the amortization amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no change to the period of benefit during the periods presented.47Table of ContentsBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsWe allocate the purchase consideration of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer contracts, expected life cycle and innovation timelines for acquired technologies, forecasted customer attrition rates and revenue growth, the fair value of pre-existing relationships, royalty rates for comparable market technologies, and discount rates. The amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We test goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment, by considering qualitative and quantitative factors. Significant qualitative inputs used in our impairment tests include, but are not limited to, consideration of general macroeconomic conditions, industry market conditions, overall Workday financial performance, and growth or declines in Workday’s share price. The primary quantitative input for our impairment test is Workday’s market capitalization as of the date of the analysis. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization at least annually, or more frequently if significant events or circumstances indicate a change in expected use.Non-Marketable Equity InvestmentsNon-marketable equity investments include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values in which we do not own a controlling interest or exercise significant influence. We adjust the carrying values of non-marketable equity investments based on observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Non-marketable equity investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market. Valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data, and require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and an inherent lack of liquidity. In addition, the rights and preferences related to the particular non-marketable equity investments, as compared to the rights and preferences of other securities within the company’s capital structure, may impact the magnitude of change in the fair value of our investment as compared to the change in total enterprise value of the company. We assess our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative and quantitative analysis of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, such as growth or decline in revenues and operating expenses, market acceptance of the investee’s product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. These factors require significant judgment. If impairment indicators are identified, we will assess the severity and duration of the impairment.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.48Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in negative impacts on global economies and financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2022, our most significant currency exposures were the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. For further information, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.Interest Rate Risk on our InvestmentsWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, money market funds, and marketable equity investments. The cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held primarily for working capital purposes. Our investment portfolios are managed to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of debt securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. Our debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale.” When the fair value of the security declines below its amortized cost basis, any portion of that decline attributable to credit losses, to the extent expected to be nonrecoverable before the sale of the impaired security, is recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.An immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have resulted in an $11 million and $10 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.Interest Rate Risk on our DebtIn April 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement pursuant to which the lenders extended to Workday a senior unsecured Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million and an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million. The Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.000% to 0.625%, or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the London interbank market plus a margin that ranges from 1.000% to 1.625%. The base rate is defined as the greatest of (i) Bank of America’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the London interbank market for a period of one month (but not less than zero) plus 1.00%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our consolidated leverage ratio.As of January 31, 2022, and 2021, the Term Loan had a carrying value of $692 million and $729 million, respectively, and there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.30% and 1.38% as of January 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.Because the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the Credit Agreement are variable, we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affect our cost of borrowing. A hypothetical immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations.49Table of ContentsIn September 2017, we completed an offering of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due October 1, 2022. The 2022 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 2022 Notes. However, the value of the 2022 Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of the 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2022 Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of the 2022 Notes was $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2022, and 2021, and the estimated fair value of the 2022 Notes was $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The estimated fair value was determined based on the quoted bid price of the 2022 Notes in an over-the-counter market as of the last trading day of each reporting period, which was $167.00 and $159.87, respectively.For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.50Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:04.728773

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations covers fiscal 2023 and 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and 2022. Discussions of fiscal 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, that was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022.OverviewWorkday delivers applications for financial management, spend management, human capital management, planning, and analytics. With Workday, our customers have a unified system that can help them plan, execute, analyze, and extend to other applications and environments, thereby helping them continuously adapt how they manage their business and operations. Our diverse customer base includes medium-sized and large, global organizations within numerous industry categories, including professional and business services, financial services, healthcare, education, government, technology, media, retail, and hospitality.We have achieved significant growth since our inception in 2005, with a substantial amount of our growth coming from new customers. Our current financial focus is on growing our revenues and expanding both our customer base and our footprint within our existing customers. While we have a history of GAAP operating losses, we strive to invest in a disciplined manner across all of our functional areas to sustain continued near-term revenue growth and support our long-term initiatives. We expect our product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will decrease over the longer term as we grow our revenues, and we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale by increasing our customer base without direct incremental development costs.We plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenues in future periods to grow our business. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications, enhance existing applications, and to address customers’ evolving needs. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our ability to sell our applications globally, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pacific, by investing in product development and customer support to address the business needs of targeted local markets, increasing our sales organization and marketing programs, acquiring and leasing additional office space, and expanding our ecosystem of service partners to support local deployments. We expect to make further significant investments in our data center capacity and equipment and third-party hosted infrastructure platforms as we plan for future growth. We are also investing in personnel to support our growing customer base.We regularly evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, employee teams, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product and service offerings. For example, in fiscal 2022, we acquired Peakon, a continuous listening platform that captures real-time employee sentiment, Zimit, a configure, price, quote solution built for services industries, and VNDLY, a cloud-based external workforce and vendor management technology. We expect to continue making such acquisitions and investments in the future. While we remain focused on improving operating margin, these acquisitions and investments will increase our costs on an absolute basis in the near term. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them and could make it difficult to determine if we are allocating our resources efficiently.Since inception, we have also invested heavily in our professional services organization to help ensure that customers successfully deploy and adopt our applications. Additionally, we continue to expand our professional services partner ecosystem to further support our customers. We believe our investment in professional services, as well as partners building consulting practices around Workday and helping to deliver additional innovation and solutions, will drive additional customer subscriptions and continued growth in revenues. Due to our ability to leverage the expanding partner ecosystem, we expect the rate of professional services revenue growth to decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth.36Table of ContentsImpact of Current Economic ConditionsRecent macroeconomic events including higher inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant uncertainty, volatility, and disruption of financial markets. Despite the continuing uncertainty associated with these events, we are confident in the long-term overall health of our business, the strength of our product offerings, and our ability to continue to execute on our strategy and help our customers on their HR and finance digital transformation journeys. Demand for our products remains strong, and we continue to achieve solid new subscription bookings.Our near-term revenues are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, the lengthening of certain sales cycles, particularly within net new opportunities. If the economic uncertainty continues, we may also experience a negative impact on customer renewals, sales and marketing efforts, revenue growth rates, customer deployments, customer collections, product development, or other financial metrics. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. For further discussion of the potential impacts of recent macroeconomic events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Financial Results OverviewThe following table provides an overview of our key metrics (in thousands, except percentages, basis points, and headcount data): As of and for the Years Ended January 31, 20232022ChangeTotal revenues$6,215,818 $5,138,798 21 %Subscription services revenues$5,567,206 $4,546,313 22 %GAAP operating income (loss)$(222,200)$(116,450)91 %Non-GAAP operating income (1)$1,209,636 $1,149,704 5 %GAAP operating margin(3.6)%(2.3)%(130 bps)Non-GAAP operating margin (1)19.5 %22.4 %(290 bps)Operating cash flows$1,657,195 $1,650,704 0 %Total subscription revenue backlog$16,448,155 $12,806,855 28 %24-month subscription revenue backlog$9,677,373 $7,975,554 21 %Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$6,121,394 $3,644,161 68 %Headcount17,744 15,204 17 %(1)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Components of Results of OperationsRevenuesWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Subscription services revenues primarily consist of fees that give our customers access to our cloud applications, which include related customer support. Professional services revenues include fees for deployment services, optimization services, and training.Subscription services revenues accounted for approximately 90% of our total revenues during fiscal 2023, and represented 96% of our total unearned revenue as of January 31, 2023. Subscription services revenues are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of workers at each customer, the specific applications subscribed to by each customer, and the price of our applications.37Table of ContentsThe mix of applications to which each customer subscribes can affect our financial performance due to price differentials in our applications. Pricing for our applications varies based on many factors, including the complexity and maturity of the application and its acceptance in the marketplace. New products or services offerings by competitors in the future could also impact the mix and pricing of our offerings.Subscription services revenues are recognized over time as services are delivered and consumed concurrently over the contractual term, beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically have a term of three years or longer and are generally noncancelable. We generally invoice our customers annually in advance. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as unearned revenue.Our consulting engagements are billed on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis. For contracts billed on a time and materials basis, revenues are recognized over time as the professional services are performed. For contracts billed on a fixed price basis, revenues are recognized over time based on the proportion of the professional services performed. In some cases, we supplement our consulting teams by subcontracting resources from our service partners and deploying them on customer engagements. As the Workday-related consulting practices of our partner firms continues to develop, we expect these partners to increasingly contract directly with our subscription customers.Subscription Revenue BacklogOur subscription revenue backlog, which is also referred to as remaining performance obligations for subscription contracts, represents contracted subscription services revenues that have not yet been recognized and includes billed and unbilled amounts. Subscription revenue backlog may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including the timing of renewals and overall renewal rates, new business growth, average contract duration, and seasonality.Costs and ExpensesCosts of subscription services revenues. Costs of subscription services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with hosting our applications and providing customer support, expenses related to data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties, and depreciation of computer equipment and software.Costs of professional services revenues. Costs of professional services revenues consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with these services, subcontractor expenses, and travel expenses.Product development expenses. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses associated with our efforts to add new features and applications, increase functionality, and enhance the ease of use of our cloud applications.Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, and travel expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand awareness, brand ambassador campaigns, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years.General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for finance and accounting, legal, HR, information systems personnel, professional fees, and other corporate expenses.Results of OperationsRevenuesOur total revenues for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202320222021Subscription services$5,567,206 $4,546,313 $3,788,452 Professional services648,612 592,485 529,544 Total revenues$6,215,818 $5,138,798 $4,317,996 38Table of ContentsTotal revenues were $6.2 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $5.1 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 21%. Subscription services revenues were $5.6 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $4.5 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 22%. The increase in subscription services revenues was primarily due to an increased number of customer contracts and strong customer renewals, with gross and net retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Professional services revenues were $649 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $592 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of $56 million, or 9%. The increase in professional services revenues was primarily due to Workday performing deployment and integration services for higher valued contracts.Subscription Revenue BacklogAs of January 31, 2023, our total subscription revenue backlog was $16.4 billion, with $9.7 billion expected to be recognized in revenues over the next 24 months. As of January 31, 2022, our total subscription revenue backlog was $12.8 billion, with $8.0 billion expected to be recognized in revenues over the next 24 months. The increase in subscription revenue backlog during fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the addition of new customers, expansion of our product offerings with existing customers, and the timing of renewals.Operating ExpensesGAAP operating expenses were $6.4 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 23%. The increase in GAAP operating expenses was primarily due to an increase of $845 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation. The main driver for the increase in employee-related expenses was higher headcount. We also recognized $40 million of expense from the workforce realignment announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Additionally, we incurred costs related to our performance-based cash bonus program that we introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 for all employees not covered under an existing cash incentive plan (“performance-based cash bonus program”). This program replaced our performance based restricted stock unit (“PRSU”) bonus program, resulting in a net increase of $36 million. Further, we changed the vesting dates of all unvested restricted stock units (“RSU”) from the 15th to the 5th of each month which resulted in an acceleration of share-based compensation expense of $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Additional increases within GAAP operating expenses included $94 million in facilities and IT-related expenses partly driven by our employees returning to our offices, $75 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity reflecting our continued investment in our technical operations infrastructure, and $54 million in travel expenses and $51 million related to marketing programs partly driven by a return to in-person events.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $4.0 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 25%. The increase in non-GAAP operating expenses included $686 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher headcount, of which $102 million was related to the new performance-based cash bonus program, and $34 million was related to the workforce realignment. Additionally, there were increases of $94 million in facilities and IT-related expenses partly driven by our employees returning to our offices, $75 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity reflecting our continued investment in our technical operations infrastructure, and $54 million in travel expenses and $51 million related to marketing programs partly driven by a return to in-person events. Non-GAAP operating expenses were calculated by excluding share-based compensation expenses and certain other expenses, which consist of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.

The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $100 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, primarily due to higher headcount, $60 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $23 million in facilities and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services were $846 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $656 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of $190 million, or 29%. The increase in costs of subscription services included increases of $81 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher headcount, $60 million in third-party expenses for hardware maintenance and data center capacity, and $23 million in facilities and IT-related expenses. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of subscription services will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and expand our technical operations infrastructure, including our data centers and computing infrastructure operated by third parties.Costs of Professional ServicesGAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $704 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $632 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of $71 million, or 11%. The increase in costs of professional services included an increase of $48 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, primarily due to higher headcount.Non-GAAP operating expenses in costs of professional services were $587 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $508 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of $79 million, or 16%. The increase in costs of professional services included an increase of $56 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher headcount.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP costs of professional services as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline as we continue to rely on our service partners to deploy our applications and as the number of our customers continues to grow.40Table of ContentsProduct DevelopmentGAAP operating expenses in product development were $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $391 million, or 21%. The increase in product development expenses included increases of $346 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, primarily due to higher headcount and $32 million in facilities and IT-related expenses.Non-GAAP operating expenses in product development were $1.6 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $325 million, or 25%. The increase in product development expenses included increases of $279 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher headcount, of which $62 million was related to the new performance-based cash bonus program, and $32 million in facilities and IT-related expenses.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our applications and develop new technologies.Sales and MarketingGAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $1.8 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $386 million, or 26%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses included increases of $255 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, primarily due to higher headcount and $48 million related to marketing programs and $33 million in travel expenses partly driven by a return to in-person events.Non-GAAP operating expenses in sales and marketing were $1.6 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2022, an increase of $358 million, or 30%. The increase in sales and marketing expenses included increases of $227 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher headcount and $48 million related to marketing programs and $33 million in travel expenses partly driven by a return to in-person events.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our domestic and international selling and marketing activities to expand brand awareness and attract new customers.General and AdministrativeGAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $604 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $486 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of $118 million, or 24%. The increase in general and administrative expenses included an increase of $96 million in employee-related expenses, including share-based compensation, primarily due to higher headcount.Non-GAAP operating expenses in general and administrative were $389 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $324 million for fiscal 2022, an increase of $65 million, or 20%. The increase in general and administrative expenses included an increase of $43 million in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher headcount.We expect GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we further invest in our infrastructure and support our global expansion.Operating MarginGAAP operating margin declined from (2.3)% for fiscal 2022 to (3.6)% for fiscal 2023, primarily related to increases in expenses due to higher headcount, a return to travel and in-person events, the workforce realignment, the rollout of the performance-based cash bonus program, an acceleration of share-based compensation expense caused by modifying the vesting dates of all unvested RSUs from the 15th to the 5th of each month, and other growth investments made across the business. These increases were offset in part by higher revenues.Non-GAAP operating margin declined from 22.4% for fiscal 2022 to 19.5% for fiscal 2023, primarily related to increases in expenses due to higher headcount, the rollout of the performance-based cash bonus program, a return to travel and in-person events, the workforce realignment, and other growth investments made across the business, offset in part by higher revenues. Non-GAAP operating margin was calculated using GAAP revenues and non-GAAP operating expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.41Table of ContentsReconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP operating income (loss) and operating margin were as follows (in thousands, except percentages): Year Ended January 31, 2023 GAAPShare-Based Compensation ExpensesOther Operating ExpensesNon-GAAP (1)Operating income (loss)$(222,200)$1,294,622 $137,214 $1,209,636 Operating margin(3.6)%20.8 %2.3 %19.5 % Year Ended January 31, 2022 GAAPShare-Based Compensation ExpensesOther Operating ExpensesNon-GAAP (1)Operating income (loss)$(116,450)$1,112,405 $153,749 $1,149,704 Operating margin(2.3)%21.6 %3.1 %22.4 % Year Ended January 31, 2021 GAAPShare-Based Compensation ExpensesOther Operating ExpensesNon-GAAP (1)Operating income (loss)$(248,599)$1,004,854 $110,986 $867,241 Operating margin(5.8)%23.3 %2.6 %20.1 %(1)See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetWe had other income (expense), net of $(38) million, $133 million, and $(27) million during fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Other expense, net in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to interest expense of $102 million on our debt primarily related to the Senior Notes and losses of $27 million on our equity investments. Expenses were offset by interest income of $98 million on our marketable securities from higher investment balances and rising interest rates. Other income, net in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to gains of $144 million on our equity investments, the majority of which related to an equity investment that completed its IPO during the period, offset by interest expense of $17 million on our debt.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of non-GAAP financial measures in Commission filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss), and Non-GAAP Operating MarginWe use the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. 42Table of ContentsOur non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin exclude the components listed below. For the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding these components provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and prospects in the same manner as management, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies, and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business.•Share-Based Compensation Expenses. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, we believe it is useful to exclude share-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Share-based compensation expenses are determined using a number of factors, including our stock price, volatility, and forfeiture rates that are beyond our control and generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Further, share-based compensation expenses are not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients.•Other Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses includes employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. For business combinations, we generally allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets. The amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization. The amount of purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus we do not believe it is reflective of ongoing operations. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from these non-GAAP measures, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.Limitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the GAAP financial measure of total operating expenses. In the case of share-based compensation, if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of share-based compensation and related employer payroll tax-related items, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.See “Results of Operations—Operating Expenses” and “Results of Operations—Operating Margin” for reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of GAAP operating expenses, GAAP operating income (loss), and GAAP operating margin, to the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), and non-GAAP operating margin, for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $6.1 billion, which were primarily held for working capital purposes. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are composed of, in order from largest to smallest, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. agency obligations, money market funds, and marketable equity investments. We have financed our operations primarily through customer payments, issuance of debt, and sales of our common stock.We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to the remaining term of contracted noncancelable subscription agreements, which are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our 2022 Credit Agreement that provides for $1.0 billion of unsecured financing, are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.43Table of ContentsOur long-term future capital requirements depend on many factors, including the effects of macroeconomic trends, customer growth rates, subscription renewal activity, headcount growth, the timing and extent of development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced services offerings, the timing and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of additional facilities, and our investment and acquisition activities. As part of our strategy, we may choose to seek additional debt or equity financing.Our cash flows fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended January 31, 202320222021Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$1,657,195 $1,650,704 $1,268,441 Investing activities(2,505,926)(1,607,426)(1,241,624)Financing activities1,203,821 110,251 625,049 Effect of exchange rate changes(595)(705)1,334 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$354,495 $152,824 $653,200 Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for both fiscal 2023 and 2022. In fiscal 2023, increased sales and related cash collections were offset by cash outlays related to higher headcount, return to travel and in-person events, a one-time intellectual property transfer tax payment, an interest payment on our Senior Notes, and other growth investments across the business.We expect our business to continue to generate sufficient operating cash flows; however, if the economic uncertainty caused by recent macroeconomic events worsens or is prolonged, our customers may request payment timing concessions, which could materially impact the timing and predictability of our operating cash flows in any given period.Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2023 was $2.5 billion, which primarily resulted from purchases of marketable securities, net of maturities, of $2.2 billion using the proceeds from the Senior Notes offering, capital expenditures for data center and office space projects of $360 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $23 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $116 million from sales of marketable and non-marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 was $1.6 billion, which was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisitions of VNDLY, Zimit, and Peakon, net of cash acquired, of $1.2 billion. Cash used in investing activities also included capital expenditures of $264 million mainly for data center projects, the purchase of leased office space within our corporate headquarters from an affiliate of our Co-Founder and CEO Emeritus, David Duffield, of $171 million, purchases of non-marketable equity and other investments of $123 million, and a cash outflow from the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities of $55 million. These payments were partially offset by proceeds of $199 million from sales of marketable securities.We expect capital expenditures will be approximately $340 million in fiscal 2024. This includes investments in our office facilities, corporate IT infrastructure, and customer data centers to support our continued growth.Financing ActivitiesFor fiscal 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion, which was primarily due to proceeds of $3.0 billion from borrowings on the Senior Notes, net of debt discount of $22 million, and $152 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, offset by the principal payment of $1.15 billion in connection with the conversion of our 0.25% convertible senior notes (“2022 Notes”), repayment of the term loan under the credit agreement entered into in April 2020 (“2020 Credit Agreement”) of $694 million, and repurchases of common stock under the Share Repurchase Program of $75 million.For fiscal 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $110 million, which was primarily due to proceeds of $148 million from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, offset by payments of $38 million on the term loan under the 2020 Credit Agreement.44Table of ContentsShare Repurchase ProgramIn November 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock. The Share Repurchase Program will have a term of 18 months, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate us to acquire any amount of Class A common stock. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of Class A common stock for approximately $75 million at an average price per share of $165.75. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of January 31, 2023, we were authorized to purchase a remaining $425 million of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock under the Share Repurchase Program.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations primarily consist of borrowings under our Senior Notes, leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity, agreements for third-party hosted infrastructure platforms for business operations, and other purchase obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business. The table below includes our material contractual obligations, excluding imputed interest, as of January 31, 2023 (in thousands). For further information, see the associated Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report referenced in the table below.Payments Due by Period TotalShort-termLong-termReferenceSenior Notes (1)$3,752,375 $110,250 $3,642,125 Note 11Operating leases300,821 97,387 203,434 Note 12Third-party hosted infrastructure platform obligations547,626 40,000 507,626 Note 13Other purchase obligations372,273 115,386 256,887 Note 13$4,973,095 $363,023 $4,610,072 (1)Consists of principal and interest payments on the Senior Notes.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgements, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, judgements, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and operating results.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for services rendered.We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•Determination of the transaction price;•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•Recognition of revenues when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.We believe the area we apply the most critical judgement when determining revenue recognition relates to the identification of distinct performance obligations. 45Table of ContentsIdentification of Performance ObligationsA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Our contracts with customers may include multiple promises to transfer services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and the value delivered to the customer. Our primary performance obligations consist of subscription services and professional services. We satisfy these performance obligations over time as we transfer the promised services to our customers. Subscription services are made up of a daily requirement to deliver the service to the customer. Each day the delivery of the service provides value to the customer and each day represents a measure toward completion of the service. As such, subscription services meet the criteria to be a series of distinct services. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date, and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct as the professional services are not interrelated with subscription services nor do they result in significant customization of the subscription service. As such, we view professional services as a performance obligation to the customer. At contract inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We combine contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same customer if we determine that the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or the services promised in the contracts are a single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we assess each promise separately and allocate the transaction price on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. We apply significant judgment in identifying and evaluating any terms and conditions in contracts which may impact revenue recognition.Deferred CommissionsSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new revenue contracts are capitalized and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Periodically, we review whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. Any future changes in circumstances around the terms of our initial and renewal contracts, customer attrition, underlying technology life, and certain other factors may materially change the period of benefit and therefore the amortization amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There was no change to the period of benefit during the periods presented.Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsWe allocate the purchase consideration of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. Critical estimates used in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customer contracts, expected life cycle and innovation timelines for acquired technologies, forecasted customer attrition rates and revenue growth, the fair value of pre-existing relationships, royalty rates for comparable market technologies, and discount rates. The amounts and estimated useful lives assigned to acquisition-related intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We test goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if a significant event or circumstance indicates impairment, by considering qualitative and quantitative factors. Significant qualitative inputs used in our impairment tests include, but are not limited to, consideration of general macroeconomic conditions, industry market conditions, overall Workday financial performance, and growth or declines in Workday’s share price. The primary quantitative input for our impairment test is Workday’s market capitalization as of the date of the analysis. We also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of acquisition-related intangible assets for changes in circumstances that warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization at least annually, or more frequently if significant events or circumstances indicate a change in expected use.46Table of ContentsNon-Marketable Equity InvestmentsNon-marketable equity investments include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values in which we do not own a controlling interest or exercise significant influence. We adjust the carrying values of non-marketable equity investments based on both observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market. Valuations of non-marketable equity investments are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data, and require our judgment due to the absence of market prices and an inherent lack of liquidity. In addition, the rights and preferences related to the particular non-marketable equity investments, as compared to the rights and preferences of other securities within the company’s capital structure, may impact the magnitude of change in the fair value of our investment as compared to the change in total enterprise value of the company. We assess our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative and quantitative analysis of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, such as growth or decline in revenues and operating expenses, market acceptance of the investee’s product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. These factors require significant judgment. If impairment indicators are identified, we will assess the severity and duration of the impairment.Change in Accounting EstimateIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our data center equipment, including servers, network equipment, and integrated complete server and network racks. Due to advances in technology, as well as investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our data center equipment, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of data center equipment from 3 years to 5 years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal 2024. Based on the carrying amount of data center equipment that were in-service as of January 31, 2023, it is estimated this change will decrease our fiscal 2024 depreciation expense by approximately $93 million. Inclusive of our forecasted capital expenditures in fiscal 2024, it is estimated the change will decrease fiscal 2024 depreciation expense by an additional $7 million, or approximately $100 million in total.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2, Accounting Standards and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.47Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKRecent macroeconomic events have resulted in negative impacts on global economies and financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts of these events on our business, financial condition, and operating results, see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of January 31, 2023, our most significant currency exposures were the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.Due to our exposure to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative hedging transactions to mitigate these risks. For further information, see Note 10, Derivative Instruments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.Interest Rate Risk on our InvestmentsWe had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $6.1 billion and $3.6 billion as of January 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, corporate bonds, commercial paper, money market funds, and marketable equity investments. The cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are held primarily for working capital purposes. Our investment portfolios are managed to preserve capital and meet liquidity needs. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of debt securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. Further, since our debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale,” if the fair value of the security declines below its amortized cost basis, then any portion of that decline attributable to credit losses, to the extent expected to be nonrecoverable before the sale of the impaired security, is recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.An immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have resulted in a $29 million and $11 million market value reduction in our investment portfolio as of January 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.Interest Rate Risk on our DebtThe Senior Notes have fixed annual interest rates, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on these debt obligations. However, the fair values of the Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of the Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.Borrowings under our 2022 Credit Agreement will bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a margin of 0.000% to 0.500% or a secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 10 basis points, plus a margin of 0.750% to 1.500%, with such margin being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio or debt rating. Because the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement are variable, we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affect our cost of borrowing.For further information, see Note 11, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:51:01.858990
