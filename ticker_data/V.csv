1403161,V,VISA INC.,2007,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview This management’s discussion and analysis covers fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, and provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and its subsidiaries and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Prior to the closing of the global reorganization in October 2007, Visa U.S.A. along with Visa International (comprising the operating regions of AP, LAC and CEMEA), Visa Canada and Visa Europe operated as one of five entities related by ownership and membership to Visa. After the reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. Visa U.S.A. is a leader in the electronic payments industry in the United States and is responsible for administering Visa payment programs in the United States. Visa U.S.A. provides products and services over a secure payments network to support payment programs offered by its member financial institutions to their consumer, commercial and merchant customers. Visa U.S.A.’s principal product platforms include consumer credit, consumer debit and cash access, prepaid and commercial programs. Visa U.S.A.’s primary customers are its member financial institutions participating in the payments network. Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. was a regional group member of Visa International and operated as a non-stock corporation with approximately 13,300 member financial institutions. Visa U.S.A. achieved 22% growth in operating revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. This growth reflects a 10% increase in payments volume (as defined below) on Visa U.S.A.’s products for the fiscal year, with double-digit payments volume growth in commercial and consumer debit products, and an 11% increase in the number of transactions. Payments volume, which is the basis for service fees, and transactions, which drive data processing fees, are key drivers for Visa U.S.A.’s business. Payments volume is defined as the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased with Visa products, including PIN-based debit volume, and excluding cash disbursements obtained with Visa-branded cards, balance transfers and convenience checks, which Visa U.S.A. refers to as cash volume. Operating revenues increased at a higher rate than underlying payments volume growth primarily due to two new acceptance fees, which are included in service fees, introduced in April 2007. The two new fees include a debit acceptance fee on debit payments volume and a credit/commercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. These changes are designed to simplify the fee structure and improve overall program efficiencies for Visa U.S.A. and its issuers while continuing to support Visa U.S.A.’s acceptance growth initiatives. While Visa U.S.A. believes that these fee changes will generate ongoing benefits, Visa U.S.A. does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact in 2007 of the new service fees introduced in the second half of fiscal 2007. Growth in operating revenues was also attributable to adjustments from Visa U.S.A.’s estimates of performance for volume and support incentive agreements as part of its regular quarterly review of these agreements. Visa U.S.A. incurred an operating loss in fiscal 2007 as a result of recording a litigation provision of $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was recorded in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into an agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007, to resolve all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and the related litigation between American Express and five co-defendant banks. Under the settlement agreement, an initial payment of $1.13 billion will be made on or before March 31, 2008, including $945 million from Visa Inc. and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning March 31, 2008, Visa Inc. will 72 Table of Contents pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million per quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. Total future payments discounted at 4.72% over the payment term, or $1.9 billion, are reflected in the litigation provision on Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and long-term accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. Visa U.S.A. intends to fund its payment obligations under the American Express settlement with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan. The remainder of the $2.7 billion litigation provision includes management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” related to the Discover litigation, and various other litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The effect of these litigation provisions on Visa U.S.A.’s earnings was partially offset by the impacts of the introduction of new service fees during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the absence of substantial charges incurred in the prior year related to customer reimbursement for costs associated with Visa U.S.A.’s holographic magnetic card, impairment charges related to Visa U.S.A.’s Mini Card license and business expenses related to a 2006 litigation settlement. See “Operating Revenues—Service Fees” and “Operating Expenses—Administrative and Other.” In November 2006, Visa U.S.A. announced plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions over the course of fiscal 2007. This action was intended to help Visa U.S.A. better align personnel and contract staffing levels with fluctuating project demand. As a result of this strategy, Visa U.S.A. reduced its total number of employees by approximately 5% of Visa U.S.A.’s total workforce at December 31, 2006. Visa U.S.A. incurred severance and related personnel costs of approximately $13 million during fiscal 2007 associated with this program. Approximately $1 million in additional charges are expected in fiscal 2008, based upon current assumptions for the timing of employee terminations. Although Visa U.S.A. believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of its plan, actual results may differ, thereby requiring Visa U.S.A. to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions. At September 30, 2007, the related liability in accrued compensation and benefits was $2 million. In August 2007, Visa U.S.A. completed the purchase of a parcel of land on the east coast of the United States and commenced construction of a new data center. The new data center is intended to support Visa U.S.A.’s technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and innovation. Visa U.S.A. anticipates that the data center will be completed in 2010 at an estimated total cost of $397 million. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Results of Operations Operating Revenues Visa U.S.A.’s operating revenues consist of gross operating revenues reduced by payments made to customers and merchants under volume and support incentive arrangements. Gross operating revenues consist of service fees, data processing fees, international transaction fees and other revenues. Visa U.S.A.’s operating revenues are based upon aggregate payments volume reported by its members and transactional information accumulated by its transaction processing systems. Visa U.S.A.’s operating revenues are primarily generated from fees calculated on the payments volume of activity on Visa-branded cards, which Visa U.S.A. refers to as service fees, and from the fees charged for providing transaction processing, which Visa U.S.A. refers to as data processing fees. Pricing varies and may be modified on a customer-by-customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. Service fees and data processing fees combined represent 82%, 81% and 81% of Visa U.S.A.’s gross operating revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Visa U.S.A. does not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining 73 Table of Contents interest rates and fees paid by consumers and commercial establishments, and most other competitive card features. Nor does Visa U.S.A. earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. Service Fees Service fees primarily reflect payments by customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Current quarter service fees are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to prior quarter payments volume as reported on customer quarterly operating certificates, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume. These payments volumes also do not include cash disbursements obtained with Visa-branded cards, balance transfers or convenience checks. Also included in service fees are acceptance fees which are used to support merchant acceptance and ongoing volume growth initiatives. Two new acceptance fees were introduced in April 2007, which apply to all consumer debit payments volume and all consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs. Prior period revenues associated with previously existing issuer fees have been reclassified from other revenues to this category for comparative purposes in Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Data Processing Fees Visa U.S.A. operates a proprietary network, VisaNet, a proprietary, secure, centralized processing platform which provides transaction processing and other payment services linking issuers and acquirers. Processing services are provided through Visa U.S.A.’s majority-owned subsidiary, Inovant, which operates VisaNet. Visa U.S.A. also provides processing services to Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe, in accordance with service agreements with these entities. Data processing fees are based on information Visa U.S.A. accumulates from VisaNet. Data processing fees are recognized as revenue in the same period the related transaction occurs or services are rendered. Data processing fees are primarily driven by the number and type of transactions and represent fees for processing transactions that facilitate the following services: • Authorization. Fees to route authorization requests to the issuer when a merchant, through its acquirer, requests approval of a cardholder’s transaction; • Clearing and settlement. Fees for determining and transferring transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers; • Single Message System, or SMS, switching. Fees for use of the SMS for determining and transferring debit transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers; • Member processing. Fees for use of the Debit Processing Service, which provides processing and support for Visa debit products and services; • Processing guarantee. Fees charged for network operations and maintenance necessary for ongoing system availability; and • Other products and services. Fees for miscellaneous services that facilitate transaction and information management among Visa U.S.A.’s customers. Volume and Support Incentives Volume and support incentives are contracts with financial institutions, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase card issuance and product acceptance 74 Table of Contents and increase Visa-branded transactions. These contracts, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide incentives based on payments volume growth or card issuance, or provide marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Visa U.S.A. provides cash and other incentives to certain customers in exchange for their commitment to generate certain payments volume using Visa-branded products for an agreed period of time. Pricing varies and may be modified on a customer-by-customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. In this regard, volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers. Accordingly, we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues. Certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections, resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives. Management regularly reviews volume and support incentives and estimates of performance. Estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than management’s original expectation or to reflect contract amendments. International Transaction Fees International transaction fees are assessed to customers on non-U.S. transactions of U.S.-based issuing financial institutions and U.S. transactions of non-U.S.-based issuing financial institutions. International transaction fees are generally driven by cross-border payments volume, which include the settlement of currency exchange activities in connection with the settlement of multi-currency transactions. International transaction fees are influenced by levels of travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes. These fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Other Revenues Other revenues represent optional card enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services, software development services and other services provided to Visa U.S.A.’s customers, Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe. Software development services are provided on a time and materials basis primarily to Visa International, Visa Europe and Visa Canada. Prior period revenues associated with previous issuer fees, which were superseded by new issuer acceptance fees discussed above, have been reclassified to service fees for comparative purposes in Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of personnel; network, electronic data processing (EDP) and communications; advertising, marketing and promotion; professional and consulting fees; administrative and other, and litigation provision. Personnel Personnel expense consists of salaries, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and Communications Network, EDP and communications represent expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, depreciation and fees for other data processing services. 75 Table of Contents Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Advertising, marketing and promotion include expenses associated with advertising and marketing programs, sponsorships, promotions and other related incentives to promote the Visa brand. In connection with certain sponsorship agreements, Visa U.S.A. has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the terms of the agreements. Visa International Fees Visa U.S.A. pays fees to Visa International based on payments volumes, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. The fees are calculated based on Visa U.S.A.’s relative percentage of these payments volumes compared to other Visa regions. Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal, and other professional services. Legal costs for third party services provided in connection with ongoing legal matters are expensed as incurred. Legal costs are included in professional and consulting fees on the consolidated statements of operations. Administrative and Other Administrative and other primarily consist of facilities’ costs, and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business, such as travel expenses. Litigation Provision Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” management records a charge to income for an estimated loss if such loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Visa U.S.A. will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future adjustments to the accrual will be made. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) primarily consists of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, interest expense, investment income, net and other non-operating income. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates relates to investments in Visa International and joint ventures that own, lease, develop and operate all facilities and properties used jointly by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International. Interest Expense Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. 76 Table of Contents Investment Income Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.6 billion, or 22%. The increase in operating revenues reflects increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, which increased 9%, and growth in transactions, which increased 11%. Growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees. While Visa U.S.A. believes that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits, Visa U.S.A. does not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 1,945 $ 1,610 $ 335 21 % Data processing fees 1,416 1,248 168 13 % Volume and support incentives (505 ) (588 ) 83 (14 )% International transaction fees 454 398 56 14 % Other revenues 280 280 — 0 % Total Operating Revenues $ 3,590 $ 2,948 $ 642 22 % Service Fees Payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, increased $105 billion, or 9%, to $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the April 2007 introduction of two new acceptance fees including a debit acceptance fee on all consumer debit payments volume and a credit/commercial acceptance fee on all consumer credit and commercial payments volume. The increase in service fees from these new acceptance fees were offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. The net impact of the new acceptance fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of $190 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data Processing Fees The increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees increased 13%, broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed. Incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from Visa U.S.A.’s debit processing services related to non-Visa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volume-based discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million, or 9%, was collectively earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. 77 Table of Contents Volume and Support Incentives The decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during management’s regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period. Performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of $73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $36 million in fiscal 2006. As the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year, estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly. We currently expect volume and support incentives to increase substantially during fiscal 2008 due to obligations assumed upon retirement of certain issuer programs during 2007. See Note 13—Restricted Assets and Liabilities and Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts, or new contracts entered into during 2008. The net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows: 2007 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, 2006, net liability(1) $ (65 ) Provision Current year provision (588 ) Performance adjustments(2) 73 Contractual amendments(3) 10 Subtotal volume and support incentives (505 ) Payments 523 Ending balance at September 30, 2007, net liability(1) $ (47 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented on the face of the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from management’s refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. International Transaction Fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by multi-currency payments volume, which increased by $10 billion, or 15%, during fiscal 2007, compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multi-currency payments volume, reflecting more cross-border transactions as overall global travel has increased. 78 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased by 127% to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase primarily reflects the $2.7 billion litigation provision, which represented 94% of that increase. Excluding the litigation provision, operating expenses increased $191 million, or 9%. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 721 $ 671 $ 50 7 % Network, EDP and communications 366 328 38 12 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 581 474 107 23 % Visa International fees 173 159 14 9 % Professional and consulting fees 334 291 43 15 % Administrative and other 211 272 (61 ) (22 )% Litigation provision 2,653 23 2,630 NM Total Operating Expenses $ 5,039 $ 2,218 $ 2,821 127 % Personnel Personnel expense increased 4% in fiscal 2007 due to a $26 million charge representing the first installment of a one-time special bonus program of $51 million associated with the establishment of Visa Inc. Half of the $51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007. The other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of an initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met. The remaining increase of 3% reflects severance expense for certain executives, annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with economic price increases, offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007. Network, EDP and Communications The increase in Network, EDP and Communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: • a $29 million in crease in fees paid for debit processing services for charges related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks, and • a $12 million increase in maintenance and equipment rental costs. Advertising, Marketing and Promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: • a $67 million increase in expenditures for certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers; and • a $23 million increase in expenditures associated with Visa Extras, Visa U.S.A.’s point-based rewards program that enables enrolled cardholders to earn reward points on qualifying purchases. The remaining increase is attributable to additional promotional activity related to Visa Signature, Visa Small Business, and Consumer Debit products. These increases were offset by the absence of initial launch expenditures for Visa U.S.A.’s new brand mark and card design which began in January 2006 and the “Life Takes Visa” advertising campaign, which began in February 2006. 79 Table of Contents Visa International Fees Although Visa U.S.A.’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy, fees paid to Visa International increased due to a one-time fee waiver of $13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007. Professional and Consulting Fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: • a $23 million increase in contractors and outsourcing expense in connection with the outsourcing of certain data processing and development functions as described in the overview above, and additional contractors in connection with the support of other development and maintenance projects; and • A $19 million increase in legal fees incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. See Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Administrative and Other Administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006: • a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; • a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States; and • an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. In addition, after a review of claims submitted, Visa U.S.A. reduced the accrual for reimbursement to customers for production costs related to the discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design by $11 million in fiscal 2007. Litigation Provision Litigation provision increased $2.6 billion reflecting a $1.9 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 4.72% over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision. The litigation provision also reflects management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” related to the Discover litigation. The American Express and Discover litigations are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with our retrospective responsibility plan. The remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. is a party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings. See Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. 80 Table of Contents Total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows: (in millions) Balance at September 30, 2006 $ 1,000 Provision for settled legal matters 1,941 Provision for unsettled legal matters 714 Bank co-defendants’ obligation to American Express(1) 185 Insurance recovery (2 ) Interest accretion on settled matters 75 Payments on settled matters (231 ) Balance at September 30, 2007 $ 3,682 (1) Visa Inc. will consolidate the initial payment to American Express (see discussion below) on behalf of the five co-defendant banks. Visa U.S.A. has recorded a corresponding receivable in prepaid and other current assets on the Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2007. Other Income (Expense) Other income was $62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of $8 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in other income primarily reflects an increase in Visa U.S.A.’s portion of equity earnings from Visa International as a result of an increase in net income for Visa International and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in Visa U.S.A.’s investment portfolio from tax-exempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities. The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for fiscal 2007 and 2006. Fiscal Year 2007 vs. 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 40 $ 13 $ 27 208 % Interest expense (81 ) (89 ) 8 (9 )% Investment income, net 103 68 35 51 % Other Income (Expense) $ 62 $ (8 ) $ 70 NM Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher Visa International net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the Retailers’ Litigation matter. Interest expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2008 as a result of the American Express Litigation, for which accretion will be recorded beginning in October 2008. See Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Investment Income, Net The increase in investment income, net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects an increase in interest income due to a shift in the Visa U.S.A.’s investment strategy from tax-exempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixed-income investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year. 81 Table of Contents Income Taxes Visa U.S.A.’s effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state statutory rates and allowable adjustments to taxable income. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23% represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35% for the prior year represented a tax expense. The 23% effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year. This benefit was less than would otherwise have been realized primarily as a result of an adjustment in a reserve related to litigation. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal Year 2007 2006 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) (Loss) income before income taxes and minority interest $ (1,387 ) $ 722 Minority interest expense 5 16 U.S. federal statutory tax (485 ) 35 % 253 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) 1 % (11 ) (2 )% Reserve for tax uncertainties related to litigation 180 (13 )% — — Non-deductible expenses and other differences 2 — % 15 3 % Minority interest—not subject to tax (2 ) — % (6 ) (1 )% Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (316 ) 23 % $ 251 35 % Visa U.S.A.’s fiscal 2007 statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of $2.7 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation. This provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the American Express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of $778 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect Visa U.S.A.’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Minority Interest The decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower Inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to Visa U.S.A.’s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions. See Note 16—Workforce Reduction to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.3 billion, or 11%. The increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increases in service fees and data processing fees due to growth in payments volume and transactions, both of which increased 17% during fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, growth in consumer credit volume continued to favorably impact operating revenues, driven largely by Visa Signature, Visa U.S.A.’s premium credit platform, which generates higher fees. Operating revenues were also impacted by growth in debit volumes and transactions processed, reflecting the ongoing impact of certain member conversions to the debit Interlink platform. 82 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 1,610 $ 1,447 $ 163 11 % Data processing fees 1,248 1,139 109 10 % Volume and support incentives (588 ) (524 ) (64 ) 12 % International transaction fees 398 360 38 11 % Other revenues 280 243 37 15 % Total Operating Revenues $ 2,948 $ 2,665 $ 283 11 % Service Fees The increase in service fees in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 of 11% was broadly in line with the growth in underlying payments volume exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, which increased $151.0 billion, or 15%, to $1.2 trillion in fiscal 2006, reflecting increased spending on all product platforms volumes. This increase was offset by a decrease in acceptance fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflecting lower revenues of $36 million related to a merchant incentive program. The program collects fees from customers and the funds are intended to support various merchant programs designed to build payments volume and increase product acceptance. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the program was modified, requiring specific use of related revenues. Revenues related to the merchant incentive program were therefore deferred and recognized only when expended as designated for specific acceptance programs. Data Processing Fees Data processing fees increased 10% primarily due to a 17% increase in the number of transactions processed in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in transactions processed outpaced the increase in data processing fees in fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher volume-based discounts resulting from consolidations among financial institution customers. Despite solid growth in the mix of debit transactions during fiscal 2006, reflecting conversion of various member financial institutions to Interlink, Visa U.S.A.’s PIN-based debit platform, the impact of volume-based discounts across all product lines outpaced the impact of growth of debit transactions. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million and $121 million was earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Volume and Support Incentives Growth of volume and support incentives in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the execution of new agreements in support of Visa U.S.A. partnership programs with existing customers, and co-branding programs with existing customers and new merchants. 83 Table of Contents The net asset (liability) of volume and support incentives changed as follows: 2006 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, 2005, net asset(1) $ 110 Provision Current year provision (635 ) Performance adjustments(2) 36 Contractual amendments(3) 11 Subtotal volume and support incentives (588 ) Payments 413 Ending balance at September 30, 2006, net liability(1) $ (65 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented on the face of the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from management’s refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. International Transaction Fees International transaction fees increased 11% while multi-currency payments volume increased 9% or $4.4 billion, in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in international transaction fees was higher than the growth in multi-currency payments volume due to the differential between foreign and domestic interchange rates. Other Revenues The increase in other revenues in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected: • revenue growth of $18 million for technology projects and services performed for Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe; and • revenue growth of $12 million from the Visa Extras loyalty program. Visa Extras is a platform for enrolled Visa cardholders to earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were unchanged at $2.2 billion for both fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Visa U.S.A. reduced its total operating expenses as a percentage of total operating revenues to 75% in fiscal 2006 compared to 83% in fiscal 2005 due to more effective expense management and the absence of certain charges associated with Visa U.S.A.’s litigation provision expense recorded in fiscal 2005. The charge to litigation provision expense in fiscal 2005 was primarily related to the multi-currency matter that was subsequently settled in fiscal 2006. See Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Fiscal Year 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 671 $ 619 $ 52 8 % Network, EDP and communications 328 338 (10 ) (3 )% Advertising, marketing and promotion 474 457 17 4 % Visa International fees 159 169 (10 ) (6 )% Professional and consulting fees 291 273 18 7 % Administrative and other 272 224 48 21 % Litigation provision 23 132 (109 ) (83 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 2,218 $ 2,212 $ 6 0 % 84 Table of Contents Personnel The increase in personnel expense in fiscal 2006 reflected annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with inflation, and a 4% increase in the number of employees in support of various corporate initiatives at Visa U.S.A. Network, EDP and Communications The decrease in network, EDP and communications expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected a decrease in software expense of $9 million due to Visa U.S.A. lowering its threshold for capitalizing software from a unit cost greater than $25,000 or an aggregate purchase cost greater than $250,000 to a unit cost or aggregate purchase cost greater than $10,000. Advertising, Marketing and Promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected higher expenditures for Visa U.S.A.’s new brand mark and card design launch which began in January 2006 and its “Life Takes Visa” advertising campaign, launched in February 2006. Visa International Fees The decrease in Visa International fees in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected reductions in Visa U.S.A.’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes, as global emerging markets experienced higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy. Professional and Consulting Fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2006 primarily due to professional contracting fees incurred to provide analysis and support for various programs and projects including product development and innovation, call center operations and global processing and system development. Additional expenses for accounting and auditing services were incurred in conjunction with Visa U.S.A.’s review of its internal controls over financial reporting, and additional legal fees were incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. Administrative and Other Administrative and other expense increased in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the following non-recurring expenses: • a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; • a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States; and • an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. 85 Table of Contents Litigation Provision The decrease in the litigation provision in fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year was driven by the following: • absence of the litigation provision for the multi-currency matter of $94 million, which was charged in fiscal 2005 and settled in fiscal 2006; • downward adjustment of $16 million to the litigation provision reflecting the settlement of two matters in July 2006; and • an $11 million insurance recovery related to one of the matters settled in July 2006. The insurance recovery was received during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006. Total liabilities for legal matters changed as follows: (in millions) Balance at September 30, 2005 $ 1,208 Provision for legal matters 34 Insurance recovery (11 ) Interest accretion on settled matters 92 Payments on settled matters (323 ) Balance at September 30, 2006 $ 1,000 Other Income (Expense) Other expense was $8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to other income of $3 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in other income primarily reflected the absence of a non-recurring gain-on-sale of a joint venture interest in Vital Processing Services LLC, a financial transaction processor for acquirers and merchants, which occurred in fiscal 2005 and lower equity in earnings related to Visa U.S.A.’s ownership in Visa International. Fiscal Year 2006 vs. 2005 2006 2005 $ Change % Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 13 $ 31 $ (18 ) (58 )% Interest expense (89 ) (109 ) 20 (18 )% Investment income, net 68 81 (13 ) (16 )% Other (Expense) Income $ (8 ) $ 3 $ (11 ) NM Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected lower Visa International net income and a decrease in Visa U.S.A.’s proportionate equity interest in Visa International earnings from the prior year, reflecting the fact that Visa U.S.A. comprised a lower percentage of total payments volume-based fees paid to Visa International. The decrease also reflected the absence of equity in earnings from Vital Processing Services LLC following the sale of Visa U.S.A.’s 50% equity interest in the joint venture during fiscal 2005. Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of accretion expense on litigation for certain merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff’s class in the Retailers’ Litigation matter. These litigation matters were settled in the first six months of fiscal 2005. See Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. 86 Table of Contents Investment Income, Net The decrease in investment income, net in fiscal 2006 primarily reflected the absence of a $42 million gain on the sale of Visa U.S.A.’s 50% equity interest in Vital Processing Services LLC in fiscal 2005. The decrease was offset by higher earnings on fixed-income investment securities, due to higher average investment balances and higher market interest rates for current year periods compared to the prior year. Income Taxes Visa U.S.A.’s effective tax rate decreased to 35% in fiscal 2006 from 40% in fiscal 2005. The lower effective tax rate is primarily attributable to additional tax benefits granted by the state related to Visa U.S.A.’s tax filing methodology in fiscal 2006. The decrease also reflects the absence of a one-time remeasurement of deferred tax assets related to the adoption of a new state tax filing methodology, which occurred in 2005. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal 2006 2005 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) Income before income taxes, cumulative effect of accounting change and minority interest $ 722 $ 606 Cumulative effect of accounting change, gross — (150 ) Income before income taxes and minority interest 722 456 Minority interest expense 16 8 U.S. federal statutory tax 253 35 % 160 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) (2 )% 21 5 % Non-deductible expenses and other differences 15 3 % 5 1 % Minority interest—not subject to tax (6 ) (1 )% (3 ) (1 )% Income Tax Expense $ 251 35 % $ 183 40 % Minority Interest In September 2005, Inovant, Inc. sold a 10% interest in Inovant to Visa Europe and a 6% interest to Visa International and its CEMEA region at a price equivalent to the founder’s cost, thereby reducing Visa U.S.A.’s ownership of Inovant from 85% to 69%. This increase in third party ownership had a full year impact in fiscal 2006 resulting in increased minority interest expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Visa U.S.A. maintains comprehensive cash flow forecasts to project Visa U.S.A.’s short-term and long-term liquidity needs, and maintains controls and governance over spending and investment decisions. Visa U.S.A.’s corporate investment policy was approved by its board of directors and Visa U.S.A.’s Asset and Liability Committee oversees Visa U.S.A.’s treasury activity. Visa U.S.A. requires capital resources and liquidity to: • enable uninterrupted settlement of debit transactions; • fund development of new technology, payment products and services; • fund payment obligations under volume and support incentives; 87 Table of Contents • finance capital expenditures and future investments; • service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness; and • pay the costs of litigation, including settlements. The objectives of Visa U.S.A.’s investment policy are to maintain integrity of principal, to provide adequate liquidity to cover settlement contingency scenarios and operating expenditures, including payments of principal and interest on its outstanding debt, inclusive of settled litigation, and to optimize investment income earned within acceptable risk criteria. Settlement of certain debit transactions due from customers participating in the Debit Processing Service and due to payment networks represents Visa U.S.A.’s most consistent liquidity requirement. These settlement receivables are generally collected on the business day following the day in which the transactions were processed, and settlement payables are typically satisfied two days following the processing day. Visa U.S.A. maintains a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net debit settlement. During fiscal 2007, Visa U.S.A. funded average daily net settlement payable balances of $62 million, with the highest daily balance being $188 million. During fiscal 2006, Visa U.S.A. funded average daily net settlement payable balances of $62 million, with the highest daily balance being $221 million. Visa International is Visa U.S.A.’s settlement agent for credit and all other debit transactions. Sources of Liquidity Visa U.S.A.’s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities and a fixed-income investment portfolio. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based on Visa U.S.A.’s estimates of when those funds will be needed. At September 30, 2007, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, Visa U.S.A.’s total liquid assets, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investment securities, and long-term investment securities, were $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as reflected in the following table: At September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 275 $ 270 $ 135 Short-term investments securities, available-for-sale 747 660 681 Total current assets 2,507 1,594 1,478 Long-term investments securities, available-for-sale 737 515 319 Total current liabilities 3,282 1,393 1,325 Current portion of long-term debt 41 32 32 Long-term debt — 41 74 Current portion of accrued litigation 2,236 216 197 Long-term portion of accrued litigation 1,446 784 1,010 Total (deficit) equity (501 ) 583 126 Working capital (775 ) 201 153 On November 1, 2007, Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International entered into an agreement with American Express to resolve all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and the related litigation between American Express and five co-defendant banks. Under the settlement agreement, an initial payment of $1.13 billion will be made on or before March 31, 2008, including $945 million from Visa Inc. and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning March 31, 2008, Visa Inc. will pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million per quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion. Total future payments discounted at 4.72% over the payment term, or 88 Table of Contents $1.9 billion, are reflected in the litigation provision on Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2007 and in current and long-term accrued litigation on its consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. Visa Inc. expects to fund future payments under the American Express settlement under its retrospective responsibility plan. The plan includes an escrow arrangement in which Visa Inc. will deposit a portion of the expected proceeds from an initial public offering, as determined by the Visa Inc. litigation committee (a committee established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among Visa Inc., Visa International, Visa U.S.A. and the members of the committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or acting for, certain Visa U.S.A. members), into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be payable. The plan also includes a loss sharing agreement in which Visa U.S.A. members that are parties to the agreement are responsible for covered litigation in proportion to the member’s ownership percentage, as calculated in accordance with Visa U.S.A.’s certificate of incorporation. This plan includes multi-step mechanisms to fund financial obligations of Visa U.S.A. and Visa International related to certain litigation, including the American Express litigation covered by this settlement agreement. See “Business—Retrospective Responsibility Plan.” Visa U.S.A. has an uncommitted credit facility with Visa International whereby Visa U.S.A. or Visa International may provide each other short-term financing with a maximum term of five business days. Neither Visa U.S.A. nor Visa International has the obligation to lend to or to borrow from the other company. There were no outstanding balances at September 30, 2007 or September 30, 2006 under this arrangement. In July 2006, Visa U.S.A.’s board of directors approved a plan to build a new data center on the east coast of the United States at an estimated cost of $397 million, which Visa U.S.A. plans to fund with its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows. Visa U.S.A. completed the land purchase and began construction in fiscal 2007; construction is expected to continue through fiscal 2010. Upon completion, Visa U.S.A. will migrate its current east coast data center to this new facility. Visa U.S.A. assesses the estimated cost to build the new data center on a regular basis and the corresponding liquidity required during each stage of the building process. In March 2007, Visa U.S.A. executed two performance bond agreements with the county in which the east coast data center will be constructed to provide assurance that land development and construction will be completed as planned. The bonds have a total value of $2 million and become due in the event that land development and construction are not completed as planned. At September 30, 2007, Visa U.S.A. had remaining committed obligations of $186 million related to the new data center. Visa U.S.A. had negative working capital at September 30, 2007, primarily due to the financial statement impact of the American Express litigation. See Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. believes its existing liquid assets and projected cash flows will be sufficient to fund its business operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future strategic developments and other commitments during fiscal 2008. Visa U.S.A. anticipates that future increases in its operating cash flows from new acceptance fees initiated in April 2007 will be offset by obligations assumed in connection with the retirement of two restricted liability programs. See Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A.’s ability to maintain these levels of liquidity could be adversely affected by several factors described under “Risk Factors,” including the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which Visa U.S.A. is a party. As part of Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of its operating performance and other relevant circumstances. Visa U.S.A. has certain off-balance sheet commitments and contingencies that may have significant future cash requirements. See “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations” and Note 12—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 14—Debt, Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. 89 Table of Contents Cash Flow Data Fiscal 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 505 $ 434 $ 481 Net cash used in investing activities (463 ) (263 ) (473 ) Net cash used in financing activities (37 ) (36 ) (46 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 5 $ 135 $ (38 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased $71 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with Visa U.S.A.’s Visa Check card program in the prior year. See Note 13—Restricted Assets and Liabilities to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The increase also reflects higher non-cash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $47 million during fiscal 2006, primarily due to payments on litigation matters largely accrued for in fiscal 2005 but settled and paid for in fiscal 2006. In addition, lower levels of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities. These decreases were offset by increases in the liability position of volume and support incentives and higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items. Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above. In addition, investment securities purchasing activity, net of sales and maturities, was higher during fiscal 2007. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 primarily reflects fewer funds available for the purchase of investment securities as a result of one-time litigation settlements, including the multi-currency matter. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on Visa U.S.A.’s series A senior secured notes due December 2007 and series B senior secured notes due December 2012. See Note 14 – Debt to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Cash requirements remained stable as the outstanding debt decreased during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Under Visa U.S.A.’s bylaws in effect prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. indemnified issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with its operating regulations. Visa International is Visa U.S.A.’s settlement agent. Visa U.S.A. partially indemnifies Visa International from losses due to the failure of a member. The term and the amount of the indemnity is not limited. Visa U.S.A. is responsible for losses up to $1.0 million plus .003% of Visa U.S.A.’s payments volume, excluding Interlink, for the year preceding the loss, or approximately $40 million in fiscal 2007. Currently settlement is guaranteed by members through the indemnification provisions in the bylaws of Visa U.S.A. and Visa 90 Table of Contents International and through separate member agreements with the individual members. Upon the closing of an initial public offering, members will no longer indemnify Visa for settlement obligations other than their own settlement obligations and those of certain other participants in the system sponsored by the member. In conjunction with Visa U.S.A.’s purchase of Inovant, Inc. from Visa International on January 1, 2003, Visa U.S.A. agreed to indemnify Visa International in the event of future tax liability in connection with an adverse determination by a taxing authority resulting from the sale of stock of Inovant, Inc. The indemnification is effective for 10 years and extends through 30 years or the statute of limitation in the event of a tax extension for the year of the stock repurchase. The maximum probability-weighted liability is considered immaterial and no liability has been accrued for this obligation. Visa U.S.A. has no special purpose entities or off-balance sheet debt, other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business and reflected in the contractual obligations table below. Contractual Obligations Visa U.S.A.’s contractual commitments will have an impact on its future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on-and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations at the end of fiscal 2007. Visa U.S.A. believes that it will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and its existing cash balances.

(2) Visa U.S.A. leases certain premises such as its data centers, certain regional offices and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Visa U.S.A. entered into a capital lease for certain computer equipment in fiscal 2005. Visa U.S.A. is financing the acquisition of the underlying assets through the leases and accordingly they are recorded on Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated financial statements. (4) Visa U.S.A. generally has non-cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build payments volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. (5) Visa U.S.A. is a party to long-term contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately 3 to 6 years. These contracts are designed to help Visa U.S.A. increase Visa-branded card usage and payments volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa U.S.A. is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa U.S.A. has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. Visa U.S.A.’s maximum advertising and marketing commitment through June 2013 is $85.9 million. (6) Represents amounts due in accordance with settlement agreements in the Retailers’ Litigation, American Express Litigation and other litigation settlements. (7) Represents payments on Visa U.S.A.’s series A and series B senior secured notes. 91 Table of Contents See Note 14—Debt, Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. also has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, and other incentive plans. See Note 12—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. Related Parties Prior to the closing of the reorganization during October 2007, Visa U.S.A. conducted business as a non-stock, non-assessable membership corporation. The principal members of Visa U.S.A. were approximately 1,600 financial institutions that participated directly in Visa U.S.A.’s payment programs. In addition, there were approximately 11,700 associate and participant members that participated in Visa U.S.A.’s payment programs through one or more principal members. At September 30, 2007, Visa U.S.A.’s board of directors was comprised of ex-officio directors, individuals who were also officers of various member financial institutions that are also Visa U.S.A.’s customers and independent directors. Visa U.S.A. generated total operating revenues of approximately $903 million, $808 million and $884 million from financial institutions with officers that also served on its board of directors in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, a significant portion of Visa U.S.A.’s operating revenues were generated from one customer with an officer that also served on the board of directors. Operating revenues from this customer were $454 million or 13%, $408 million or 14%, and $345 million or 13% of Visa U.S.A.’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, operating revenues generated from a customer which did not have an officer on the board were $384 million, or 11% in fiscal 2007. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Visa U.S.A.’s total operating revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. See Note 18—Related Parties to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements. The loss of these customers could adversely impact Visa U.S.A.’s operating revenues and operating income. Critical Accounting Estimates Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated financial statements. Visa U.S.A. has established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of Visa U.S.A.’s current accounting policies involving significant management judgment. 92 Table of Contents Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate Visa U.S.A.’s reported financial results, as they require management’s most subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Visa U.S.A. enters into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and increase product acceptance. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are fixed payments and are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit. Volume and support incentives require significant management estimates. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and conversion. Performance is estimated by using financial institution customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with Visa U.S.A.’s customers. If the customers’ actual performance is not consistent with Visa U.S.A.’s estimates, revenue discounts and incentives which are recorded as a reduction of revenue, including volume and support incentives, may be materially different than initially recorded. For fiscal 2007, performance adjustments to Visa U.S.A.’s volume and support accruals increased operating revenues by 2.0% due to slower growth in payments volume by Visa U.S.A. customers. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, performance adjustments increased operating revenues by 1.2% and 0.2%, respectively. Pension Pension assumptions are significant inputs to actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations and related effects on operations. Two critical assumptions—discount rate and expected return on assets—are important elements of plan expense and asset/liability measurements. These critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually on a plan basis. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the impact of these differences are accumulated and amortized over future periods. Visa U.S.A.’s discount rate is based To reflect market interest rate conditions in calculating the projected benefit obligation, the pension discount rate was decreased from 6.2% at June 30, 2006 to 6.0% at September 30, 2007. An expected rate of return of 7.5% was utilized at both June 30, 2007 and 2006. A 25 basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate would increase or decrease annual pension expense, respectively, by $4.3 million. A 25 basis point decrease or increase in the expected return on assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense, respectively, by $1.2 million. 93 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions on matching the duration of corporate bond pools to the expected pension payment stream. The discount rate enables Visa U.S.A. to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on current and expected asset allocation, as well as the long-term historical risks and returns associated with each asset class within the plan portfolio. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets increases pension cost. Legal Matters Visa U.S.A. is a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Except as described in Note 20—Legal Matters to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements, Visa U.S.A. does not believe that any legal proceeding to which Visa U.S.A. is a party would have a material adverse impact on Visa U.S.A.’s business. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Visa U.S.A. evaluates the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings to which Visa U.S.A. is party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (SFAS 5). Visa U.S.A. records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for claims and legal and regulatory proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Visa U.S.A.’s judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of Visa U.S.A.’s defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which Visa U.S.A. operates, its judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse affects on Visa U.S.A.’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 94 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Credit and Debit Settlement Guarantee Subject to Visa U.S.A.’s bylaws and operating regulations, Visa U.S.A. indemnifies issuing and acquiring members for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other member to honor credit and debit drafts, travelers cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with Visa U.S.A.’s operating regulations. The fair value of the associated settlement risk guarantee is based on estimates. Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies to the Visa U.S.A. fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements describes the methodology Visa U.S.A. uses to estimate Visa U.S.A.’s liability for this guarantee. Management estimates on a quarterly basis the value of the guarantee by applying the following formula: Settlement Risk Guarantee = Total Exposure multiplied by Failure Probability multiplied by Loss upon Failure Total exposure represents the average number of days to settle multiplied by the average daily transaction volume. Failure probability represents the probability of failure by individual financial institution customers based on assessed credit ratings. Loss upon failure represents the actual loss expected to be incurred in the event that a financial institution fails. For fiscal 2007, management’s internal estimates used in the above calculation were: Total Exposure = $14.8 billion Weighted Average Failure Probability = 0.006% Loss upon Failure = 45% The most critical assumption in estimating the settlement risk guarantee liability is the weighted average failure probability. Visa U.S.A. establishes this estimate by using actual loss history for the previous ten-year period and third party ratings of creditworthiness for Visa U.S.A. members. Visa U.S.A.’s estimate of total exposure changes period to period as a result of movement in overall volume of settlement transactions. Visa U.S.A.’s estimate of the weighted average failure probability changes as a result of changes in its assessment of the creditworthiness of Visa U.S.A. financial institution customers. Visa U.S.A.’s estimate of loss upon failure changes based on the U.S. bank standard for losses on commercial lending. A 25% increase in any of the assumptions used in the calculation of the settlement risk guarantee will have an immaterial impact on the liability recorded. However, if Visa U.S.A. experiences a significant increase in loss occurrences or significant actual losses occur in the future under this guarantee the impact to the estimated loss upon failure assumption could result in an increase to the obligation under the settlement risk guarantee that could be material to the consolidated financial statements. If the weighted average failure probability doubled, Visa U.S.A.’s estimated liability would increase by less than $1 million at September 30, 2007. 95 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Income Taxes In calculating its effective tax rate Visa U.S.A. makes judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Visa U.S.A. has various tax filing positions, with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Visa U.S.A. has procedures to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although Visa U.S.A. believes that its estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including Visa U.S.A.’s tax benefit of $778 million associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the recognition of a liability under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Seasonality Visa U.S.A. does not experience a pronounced seasonality in its business. No individual quarter of fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005 has historically accounted for more than 30% of annual revenue. Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For the benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Visa U.S.A. expects the adoption of FIN 48 on October 1, 2007 will result in an increase to accumulated net income of approximately $6.3 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157), which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Visa U.S.A. is in the process of determining the effect, if any, of adopting SFAS 157 on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (SFAS 158), which amends FASB issued Statement No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87) and FASB issued Statement No. 106, “Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” (SFAS 106) to require recognition of the over-funded or under-funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet. Under SFAS 158, 96 Table of Contents gains and losses, prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost. In addition, SFAS 158 requires that the measurement date, the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured, be the company’s fiscal year end. Visa U.S.A. adopted the recognition provision of SFAS 158 at September 30, 2007. Visa U.S.A. adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 at October 1, 2006, using the 15-month approach. Under this approach, Visa U.S.A. recorded an additional 3 months of net periodic benefit cost covering the period between the previous measurement date of June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006. The benefit expense of $8.7 million, net of tax, was recorded as a reduction to beginning accumulated net (loss) income at October 1, 2006. The effects to Visa U.S.A. of applying the recognition and measurement-date provision of SFAS 158 on individual line items in Visa U.S.A.’s consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007 are as follows: Prior toapplicationof SFAS 158 SFAS 158applicationadjustments Afterapplicationof SFAS 158 (in thousands) Current portion of deferred tax assets $ 794,925 $ 88 $ 795,013 Deferred tax assets 464,286 6,340 470,626 Total assets 4,383,689 6,428 4,390,117 Accrued compensation and benefits 240,079 4,235 244,314 Other liabilities 107,512 17,516 125,028 Total liabilities 4,831,083 21,751 4,852,834 Minority interest 42,928 (4,318 ) 38,610 Accumulated net loss (492,323 ) (8,676 ) (500,999 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 2,001 (2,329 ) (328 ) Total deficit (490,322 ) (11,005 ) (501,327 ) Total liabilities, minority interest, and equity 4,383,689 6,428 4,390,117 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to SFAS 115” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis under a fair value option. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2007. Visa U.S.A. is in the process of determining the effect, if any, of adopting SFAS 159 on its consolidated financial statements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices. Visa U.S.A. is exposed to two significant market risks that could affect its business including: changes in interest rates and equity prices. Visa U.S.A. does not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 97 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk A significant portion of Visa U.S.A.’s investment portfolio assets is held in fixed-income securities. These assets are reflected as cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Visa U.S.A. does not consider its cash and cash equivalents or its auction rate securities to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective, as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities or repricing characteristics of three months or less. The fair value balances of Visa U.S.A.’s short-term and long-term available-for-sale investments at September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006 include: September 30, 2007 2006 (in millions, exceptpercentages) Government-sponsored entities 1,274 895 Tax-exempt municipal bonds 9 249 Total $ 1,283 $ 1,144 Percentage of Total Assets 29 % 39 % Visa U.S.A. manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing primarily in rate-adjustable, or short-term securities, and a modest amount of fixed rate government agency securities to support longer term obligations. However, Visa U.S.A.’s efforts do not provide complete assurance that it will be protected from interest rate fluctuations. A sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of Visa U.S.A.’s investment portfolio. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the fair value of the investment portfolio by approximately $7 million or $2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007 and approximately $12 million and $6 million, respectively, at September 30, 2006. Equity Price Risk Visa U.S.A. owns equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with Visa U.S.A.’s long-term incentive and deferred compensation plans. Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Gains and losses experienced on these equity investments are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense, respectively. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense, respectively, by $5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. 98 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:09.015679
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2008,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Historical and Pro Forma Financial Condition and Results of Operations Transparency and clarity are integral to successful financial reporting and we continually strive to provide informative financial disclosures with an accurate view of our operating results and financial position. Our management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa”, “we”, “our”, and the “Company”) on a historical and pro forma basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. Our MD&A is presented in nine sections: • Overview • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements • Contractual Obligations • Related Parties • Critical Accounting Estimates • Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements • Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Visa Inc.’s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview Visa operates the world’s largest retail electronic payments network and manages the world’s most recognized global financial services brand. We provide financial institutions with platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation will continue to yield significant growth opportunities. We will continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visa’s ability to compete, Visa consummated a reorganization in October 2007 in which Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Visa Canada and Inovant became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc., a Delaware stock corporation. Visa Europe remained an independent company owned by its financial institutions. To further enhance our competitive position, we successfully completed an IPO in March 2008. Further details of our reorganization and IPO are discussed below in “The Reorganization and IPO.” We believe that successful completion of the reorganization and IPO position us to best execute our business strategy. The global alignment of various functions and best practices subsequent to the IPO provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies in the near term and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments in the long term. The alignment of our global sales and new product development functions will also help to deliver consistent and superior client services that meet local market needs. 51 Table of Contents New product development is a critical business priority for Visa. It enables us to maintain our industry leader position by capitalizing on the payment industry’s growth opportunities and to execute our business strategy in the long term. More broadly, new product development encourages economic growth and enhances the trust and integrity of electronic payments. The following business initiatives expand the scope of payment solutions to benefit existing customers and position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Although the short term volume expected from these initiatives is relatively small in comparison to total Visa volume today, we believe they are the foundation which will fuel incremental volume on our payments network in the long term. • Prepaid. By offering consumers an option to “pay ahead”, we are able to reach new demographics, particularly the unbanked or underbanked consumers in the United States and globally. Prepaid products allow us to expand our business relationships with new clients such as those in the government and healthcare sectors, while increasing our brand presence across different market segments. We continue to identify opportunities to deliver prepaid products to meet the needs of specific local and regional markets. • Mobile and eCommerce. As the internet and mobile phones become increasingly accessible around the world, they provide ideal platforms for us to expand our network capabilities to deliver not only payment solutions but also related information services – such as cardholder account activity, targeted merchant offers, or instant ATM locator. We have launched a suite of pilot consumer and commercial programs and intend to continually invest in related technologies, either through strategic investments or other partnerships, to help enhance Visa’s brand position as global commerce and information sharing are increasingly conducted over internet and mobile platforms. • Money Transfer. Individual and business consumers across the globe transfer money daily to conduct day-to-day business. Our Money Transfer product provides a secure, convenient and person-to-person platform to transfer money between Visa cardholders around the world. Money Transfer is a relevant product that meets current market needs particularly in countries outside the United States. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending patterns. Many of our financial institution customers are facing increased financial strain due to current turbulence in the financial and credit markets. Should financial institutions face limited access to credit, this may in turn constrain their ability to extend credit, ultimately impacting overall economic spending. Current economic conditions have also led to consolidation in the financial sector. Should the trend toward consolidation in the financial sector continue, this may have the effect of slowing our rate of revenue growth in the future, should one of our customers be acquired by a financial institution which is aligned with one of our competitors. Our rate of revenue growth may also be impacted by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged business. We expect that continued turbulence in overall economic conditions will moderate consumer and commercial discretionary spending, and our rate of credit payments volume growth, in the near term. However, we believe that the continued secular shift to debit payment products for non-discretionary spending will buffer the near term impact to our overall payments volume growth. There is no historical combined statement of operations of Visa Inc. prior to October 1, 2007, because Visa Inc. did not have any operations prior to the reorganization. In order to provide insight into our operating results and trends affecting our business, this management’s discussion and analysis of our operating results includes a comparison of the results of operations for fiscal 2008 to the pro forma results of operations for fiscal 2007, as if the reorganization had occurred on October 1, 2006. This pro forma information is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, and 52 Table of Contents presented in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”). See Note 3—The Reorganization to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, this management’s discussion and analysis includes a comparison of our operating results for fiscal 2008 to the operating results of Visa U.S.A., deemed the accounting acquirer in the reorganization, for fiscal 2007 and 2006. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service fees and processed transactions are the basis for data processing fees. Current period service fees are generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume. Payments volume and revenues are impacted by changes in currency rates. Payments volume and revenues increased, reflecting in part the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, during fiscal 2008 compared to pro forma fiscal 2007. Payments volume increased 17%, to $2.7 trillion during fiscal 2008, with double-digit growth in all product categories. Growth in the United States continues to reflect increases in non-discretionary spending and growth in debit. Growth outside the U.S. reflects continued penetration into emerging markets. Payments volume does not impact the operating revenues we earn from Visa Europe. The following tables set forth product payments volumes for the periods presented: U.S.A. Rest of World(3) Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2008(4) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2007(4) %Change (in billions, except percentages) Payments Volume Consumer credit $ 661 $ 624 6 % $ 802 $ 634 27 % $ 1,463 $ 1,258 16 % Consumer debit(1) 733 637 15 % 133 93 43 % 866 730 19 % Commercial and other 217 188 16 % 108 90 20 % 325 278 17 % Total Payments Volume $ 1,611 $ 1,449 11 % $ 1,043 $ 817 28 % $ 2,654 $ 2,266 17 % Cash volume 406 382 6 % 1,127 834 35 % 1,533 1,216 26 % Total Volume(2) $ 2,017 $ 1,831 10 % $ 2,170 $ 1,651 31 % $ 4,187 $ 3,482 20 % (1) Includes prepaid volume. (2) Total volume is the sum of total payments volume and cash volume. Total payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (3) Includes Bulgaria and Romania through March 31, 2007, after which time such countries became part of Visa Europe. (4) Service fee revenue in a given quarter is assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter, excluding PIN-based debit volume. Therefore, service fees reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007 were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Processed transactions increased by 4.2 billion, or 13%, to 37.0 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to prior year. Growth in transactions processed in the United States accounted for the majority of growth in transactions processed. We continue to identify opportunities to expand our processing role outside of the United States through the penetration of our core products and the delivery of new and innovative products that meet the needs of regional markets. The following table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the periods presented: Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 2007ProForma % Change (in millions) Total transactions 36,956 32,720 13 % Operating income as a percentage of operating revenues, or operating margin, was 20% for fiscal 2008 compared with pro forma operating margin of (21%) in fiscal 2007. Our fiscal 2008 operating income includes a litigation provision of $1.5 billion, which contains an additional litigation provision of $1.1 billion in connection with an agreement reached with Discover Financial Services, to settle pending litigation. Since the Discover litigation is covered by the Company’s Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Company’s class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the plan. Refer to Note 23—Legal Matters and Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information. The increase in our operating margin during 2008 is primarily attributable to growth in operating revenues resulting from pricing changes and new fees. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes occur. Revenue growth attributable to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2008 was approximately 2% compared to the prior year and primarily impacts service fees and international transaction fees. Should the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar continue, this would have the opposite impact on our revenues. The Reorganization and IPO Our reorganization in October 2007 and subsequent IPO in March 2008 generated certain unique and non-recurring business events and transactions. Visa Europe did not become a subsidiary of Visa Inc., but rather remained owned by its member financial institutions and entered into a set of contractual arrangements with Visa Inc. In connection with the reorganization, we issued different classes and series of shares reflecting the different rights and obligations of Visa financial institution members and Visa Europe based on the geographic region in which they are located. In March 2008, we successfully completed an IPO, selling 446.6 million shares of class A common stock to the public, which raised $19.1 billion in net proceeds. We used $13.4 billion of the net proceeds from the IPO to redeem a portion of the class B and class C (series I) shares of Visa’s financial institution members and as a result Visa is now majority owned by the public. Pursuant to our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, we established an escrow account with $3.0 billion of the net proceeds of the IPO. Our Retrospective Responsibility Plan is a central component of the 54 Table of Contents reorganization and is designed to address potential liabilities arising from certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. Future settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable from the escrow account. Our capital structure was designed to implement a key principle of the Retrospective Responsibility Plan, which is that liability for the covered litigation would remain with the holders of our class B common stock, all of which are members or affiliates of members of Visa U.S.A. See Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The remaining net proceeds of $2.7 billion were retained and have been used, in October 2008, to fund the redemption of all of the class C (series II) shares and a portion of the class C (series III) shares held by Visa Europe. See Note 16—Stockholders Equity and Redeemable Shares to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. The reorganization and IPO impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition currently and in future periods in a number of significant ways: • Charges. We incurred charges related to severance and other termination benefits totaling $93 million during 2008. We continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional charges, which may be significant, into fiscal 2009. In connection with the IPO, we granted equity compensation awards to employees and non-employee directors. We incurred $74 million in share-based compensation cost during fiscal 2008. • Visa Europe put option. We granted Visa Europe the option to cause the sale of Visa Europe to us. We will record any change in the fair market value of this option in our consolidated statement of operations. Changes in the value of the put option will result in fluctuations in our reported net income. The exercise of the Visa Europe put option would also result in a significant liquidity event. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time after March 25, 2009. • Income taxes. As a result of completing the IPO and consequent ownership by parties other than our financial institution customers, we are no longer eligible to claim the California special deduction previously available to Visa U.S.A. and Visa International Service Association on the basis that both operated on a cooperative or mutual basis. Our tax provision was updated to reflect the loss of the special deduction during the last six months of fiscal 2008, resulting in an increase in taxes of $29 million in fiscal 2008. We are evaluating our global corporate tax structure as a newly formed global company and are considering various tax alternatives and strategies to assist in managing our effective tax rate in the future. We expect to see a gradual decline in our effective tax rate beginning in fiscal 2009. • One time tax benefit. As anticipated, following our IPO, our earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 increased by $107 million as a result of a one-time estimated tax benefit due to a change in our state tax apportionment methodology. 55 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues and Expenses Operating Revenues Our operating revenues consist of gross operating revenues reduced by payments made to customers and merchants under volume and support incentive arrangements. Gross operating revenues consist of service fees, data processing fees, international transaction fees and other revenues. Our operating revenues are primarily generated from fees calculated on the payments volume of activity on Visa-branded cards, which we refer to as service fees, and from the fees charged for providing transaction processing, which we refer to as data processing fees. Payments volume is reported by our customers and transactional information is accumulated by our transaction processing systems. Historically, pricing has varied among our different geographies because geographies outside the United States had operated under an association business model with distinct, autonomous strategies, boards of directors and management teams. In 2007, geographies outside the United States began the transition to a business model seeking to increase profitability and made competitive increases in their pricing structure. Further competitive pricing changes were made during fiscal 2008 and we will continue to assess opportunities for competitive adjustments that align with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. Nor do we earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service fees Service fees reflect payments by customers for their participation in card programs carrying our brands. Service fees are primarily calculated on the payments volume of products carrying the Visa brand. We rely on our customers to report payments volume to us. Service fees in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter, excluding PIN-based debit volume. Therefore, service fees reported with respect to the 12 months ended September 30, 2008, were based on payments volumes reported by our customers for the 12 months ended June 30, 2008. Furthermore, pro forma service fees for the twelve months ended September 30, 2007 were based on payments volumes reported by our customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007. These actual and pro forma payments volumes also do not include cash disbursements obtained with Visa-branded cards, balance transfers or convenience checks, which we refer to as cash volume. New service fees were introduced in April 2007, which apply to U.S. consumer debit, consumer credit and commercial payments volume. These fees supersede previously existing issuer programs. Data processing fees Data processing fees consist of fees charged to customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services, including processing services provided under our bilateral services agreement with Visa Europe. Data processing fees are based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transaction occurs or services are rendered. 56 Table of Contents Data processing fees are primarily driven by the number, size and type of transactions processed and represent fees for processing transactions that facilitate the following services: • Authorization. Fees to route authorization requests to the issuer when a merchant, through its acquirer, requests approval of a cardholder’s transaction. • Clearing and settlement. Fees for determining and transferring transaction amounts due between acquirers and issuers. • Single Message System, or SMS, switching. Fees for use of the SMS for determining and transferring transaction amounts between acquirers and issuers. • Member processing. Fees for use of the debit processing service, which provides processing and support for Visa debit products and services. • Processing guarantee. Fees charged for network operations and maintenance necessary for ongoing system availability. • Other products and services. Fees for miscellaneous services that facilitate transaction and information management among Visa members. International transaction fees International transaction fees are assessed to customers on transactions where an issuer is domiciled in one country and a merchant’s acquirer is located in another country. International transaction fees are generally driven by cross-border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. International transaction fees are influenced in large part by levels of travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes. These fees are recognized as revenues in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Other revenues Other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification. Other revenues also include licensing and other service related fees from Visa Europe under the framework agreement entered into as part of the reorganization. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Volume and support incentives Volume and support incentives are contracts with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase card issuance and product acceptance and increase Visa-branded transactions. These contracts, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide incentives based on payments volume growth or card issuance, or provide marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. We provide cash and other incentives to certain customers in exchange for their commitment to generate certain payments volume using Visa-branded products for an agreed period of time. Pricing varies among our different geographies and may be modified on a customer-by-customer basis through volume and support incentive arrangements. In this regard, volume and support incentives represent a form of price reduction to these customers. Accordingly, we record these arrangements as a reduction to operating revenues. Certain incentives are estimated based on projected performance criteria and may change when actual performance varies from projections, resulting in adjustments to volume and support incentives. Management regularly reviews volume and 57 Table of Contents support incentives and estimates of performance. Estimated costs associated with these contracts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect payments volume performance and projections that are higher or lower than management’s original expectation or to reflect contract amendments. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of: personnel; network, electronic data processing (EDP) and communications; advertising, marketing and promotion; professional and consulting fees; depreciation and amortization; administrative and other; and litigation provision. Personnel Personnel expense consists of salaries, stock-based compensation, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and communications Network, EDP and communications represent expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion Advertising, marketing and promotion include expenses associated with advertising and marketing programs, sponsorships, promotions and other related incentives to promote the Visa brand. In connection with certain sponsorship agreements, we have an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the terms of the agreements. Visa International Fees Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. paid fees to Visa International based on payments volumes, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. These fees ceased as a result of the reorganization as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International became subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal and other professional services. Legal costs for third party services provided in connection with ongoing legal matters are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization include depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in the reorganization. Administrative and other Administrative and other primarily consist of facilities costs and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business, such as travel expenses. 58 Table of Contents Litigation provision Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” (“SFAS 5”) management records a charge to income for an estimated loss if such loss is probable and reasonably estimable. We will continue to review the litigation accrual and, if necessary, future adjustments to the accrual will be made. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) primarily consists of interest expense, investment income, net and other non-operating income. Interest expense Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments. Other non-operating income Other non-operating income relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the framework agreement with Visa Europe. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 compared to Visa Inc. Pro Forma Results for Fiscal 2007 Operating Revenues In fiscal 2008, operating revenues were $6.3 billion compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2007. The increase in operating revenues reflects an increase in payments volume, which increased 17%, as well as an increase in transactions processed, which increased by 13%. Revenue growth was also impacted by increases in the monetary value and the number of cross-border transactions. Current economic conditions have led to consolidation in the financial sector. Should the trend toward consolidation in the financial sector continue, this may have the effect of slowing our rate of revenue growth in the future, should one of our customers be acquired by a financial institution which is aligned with one of our competitors. Our rate of revenue growth may also be impacted by price compression should one of our financial institution customers absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume-based discounts on the combined volumes of the merged business. We expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. 59 Table of Contents The following table sets forth our actual and pro forma operating revenues earned in the U.S., throughout the rest of the world, and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the framework agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 4—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 3,664 $ 3,312 $ 352 11 % Rest of world operating revenues 2,378 1,688 690 41 % EU fee operating revenues 221 193 28 15 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 5,193 $ 1,070 21 % Operating revenues earned throughout the rest of the world for the twelve month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 represented 38% and 33% of total operating revenues, respectively. Growth in operating revenues earned throughout the rest of the world accounted for 64% of the increase in total operating revenues for the twelve month periods. The increase in operating revenues throughout the rest of the world reflects the impact of pricing modifications made on various services during the second half of fiscal 2007 as those geographies transitioned to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe that these pricing changes will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that this rate of revenue growth is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impact of these pricing modifications. We expect future price increases to correlate more closely with innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States result from cross-border business and leisure travel. Revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. We expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross-border business and leisure travel, in the near term. The following table sets forth the components of our actual and pro forma total operating revenues. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 3,061 $ 2,582 $ 479 19 % Data processing fees 2,073 1,659 414 25 % International transaction fees 1,721 1,193 528 44 % Other revenues 569 473 96 20 % Volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (714 ) (447 ) 63 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 5,193 $ 1,070 21 % 60 Table of Contents Service fees Payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume increased $388.3 billion, or 17%, to $2.7 trillion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. Growth in service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to new service fees introduced in April 2007 which superseded previously existing arrangements with issuers. The new fees increased service fee revenue by $131 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2008. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees reflects 13% growth in the number of transactions processed. We processed 37.0 billion transactions during fiscal 2008, compared to 32.8 billion in fiscal 2007. Growth in data processing fees outpaced the growth in underlying transaction volumes primarily due to new services and various pricing modifications both inside and outside the United States which collectively increased data processing fees by 7%. Certain of the data processing pricing modifications took place following the beginning of the third quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in revenues which continued to grow at a faster rate than transactions. The pricing increases outside the United States reflect transition to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe these pricing changes will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in data processing fees is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts of these changes in pricing. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by cross-border payments volume, which experienced double digit growth, reflecting more cross-border transactions and the continued expansion in the use of electronic payments for travel purposes. During fiscal 2008, growth in international transaction fees outpaced the increase in cross-border payments volume primarily due to modifications to pricing structures for certain international transactions in the United States in April 2008, as well as pricing increases outside the United States which took place in all geographical regions during the first half of fiscal 2007 as our businesses outside the United States transitioned to a business model seeking to increase profitability. While we believe the pricing modifications will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in international transaction fees is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts of these changes in pricing. Growth in international transaction fees also reflects the positive impact of the weak U.S. dollar throughout most of fiscal 2008. As noted above, we expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross-border business and leisure travel, in the near term. The impact of this trend on our revenues could be amplified should the current strengthening of the U.S. dollar continue. Other revenues The increase in other revenues was primarily driven by growth in fees related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform in which enrolled Visa cardholders earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Visa earns revenues from its financial service institution customers for administrative and rewards 61 Table of Contents fulfillment services performed in support of the Visa Extras platform. Visa Extras contributed to an increase in other revenue of 9%. Growth in other revenues was also impacted by increases in fines associated with our Cardholder Information Security Program for acquirers whose merchants have not yet met compliance standards. Volume and support incentives The increase in volume and support incentives in the current period was primarily attributable to unusually lower levels of contra revenue recorded in fiscal 2007. The lower volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by significant performance adjustments recorded in the prior year. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies of the acquired regions to that of the accounting acquirer; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in the prior year. Further detail of these and other factors are provided below. • We recorded downward adjustments of $81 million related to U.S. based volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 compared to $15 million in fiscal 2008, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $66 million. • As anticipated, volume and support incentives increased during fiscal 2008 due to a non-recurring charge in the second fiscal quarter related to a customer agreement executed in the period, which increased volume and support incentives by $70 million. • As further anticipated, the accounting impact of volume and support incentives assumed upon the restructuring of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007 increased volume and support incentives by $188 million. Additional increases in volume and support incentives reflect the impact of new contracts and higher payments volumes and number of transactions processed. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts or new contracts. The net liability of volume and support incentives changed as follows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 (in millions) (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, net liability(1) $ (87 ) $ (274 ) Provision Current year provision (1,167 ) (805 ) Performance adjustments(2) 15 81 Contractual amendments(3) (9 ) 10 Subtotal volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (714 ) Payments 1,378 901 Ending balance at September 30, net asset (liability)(4) $ 130 $ (87 ) (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives of Visa Inc. at October 1, 2007 and October 1, 2006 on a pro forma basis, respectively. (2) Amount represents adjustments resulting from management’s refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. (4) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented in the consolidated balance sheet of Visa Inc. at September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. 62 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses decreased 20% for fiscal 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. The change primarily reflects decreases in the litigation provision and professional and consulting fees. The following table sets forth the components of our actual and pro forma operating expenses. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,199 $ 1,159 $ 40 3 % Network, EDP and communications 339 308 31 10 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,016 1,075 (59 ) (5 )% Professional and consulting fees 438 552 (114 ) (21 )% Depreciation and amortization 237 228 9 4 % Administrative and other 332 334 (2 ) (1 )% Litigation provision 1,470 2,653 (1,183 ) (45 )% Total Operating Expenses $ 5,031 $ 6,309 $ (1,278 ) (20 )% Personnel The increase in personnel expense for fiscal 2008 reflects the offsetting impacts of charges incurred with the reorganization and IPO and reduction of certain pension and incentive expenses. Personnel expense increased due to the combined impacts of: (i) severance and other charges incurred during the period associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions; (ii) compensation expenses related to stock-based awards granted to employees in connection with our IPO and (iii) a pension settlement charge of $27 million related to early recognition of actuarial losses related to employee attrition during fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $93 million in severance and other charges related to workforce consolidation, an increase of $80 million over similar charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. In connection with our IPO in March 2008, employees were granted stock-based awards and as a result, we recognized $74 million in compensation expense during fiscal 2008. Charges incurred related to workforce consolidation and equity awards were offset by reductions in pension expense of $34 million due to conversion of our defined benefit pension plan to a cash-balance plan in fiscal 2008 and due to the absence of a special $53 million IPO incentive granted to employees in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Due to the deterioration in market conditions and the resulting impact on the fair value of our pension plan assets upon remeasurement at September 30, 2008, we expect that our pension plan expense will increase in fiscal 2009. Also, we continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional severance charges, which may be significant, in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense during fiscal 2008 reflects a 6% increase in maintenance, equipment rental and other costs related to outsourcing certain development activities to remote locations compared to the prior year. Maintenance and equipment rental costs may 63 Table of Contents continue to increase over time as we continue to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects an increase in fees for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks. Advertising, marketing and promotion The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by the absence of certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that did not recur during fiscal 2008. The absence of these joint promotional campaigns reduced advertising, marketing and promotion expense by $104 million. This decrease was offset by higher advertising and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics coupled with increased promotional activity related to our Visa Extras reward program. Professional and consulting fees The reduction in professional fees during fiscal 2008 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in the prior year in connection with our reorganization. During the first half of fiscal 2008, consulting and legal fees incurred to support the IPO in fiscal 2008 were offset against the net proceeds from our IPO, reducing professional and consulting fees by $24 million versus the prior year comparable period. During 2007, professional fees incurred to support the reorganization were expensed. The reduction in consulting and legal fees attributable to the absence of prior year reorganization expenses was $94 million. Additionally, legal fees decreased in fiscal 2008 reflecting settlement of the American Express litigation in fiscal 2007. Litigation provision The decrease in litigation provision primarily reflects (i) the absence of a $1.9 billion provision related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, offset by (ii) an increase during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.1 billion to our litigation provision in connection with settlement of litigation with Discover Financial Services. Since both of these matters are covered by our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to our class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the plan. The increase also reflects additional accruals made in fiscal 2008 under the provisions of SFAS 5, related to other covered litigation. See Note 23—Legal Matters and Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for fiscal 2008 compared to our other income (expense) on a pro forma basis for fiscal 2007. Fiscal Year ended September 30, Visa Inc.2008 ProForma2007 $Change %Change (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ — $ 1 NM Interest expense (143 ) (96 ) (47 ) 49 % Investment income, net 211 197 14 7 % Other 35 8 27 NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 104 $ 109 $ (5 ) (5 )% 64 Table of Contents Interest expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest accretion attributed to the American Express settlement. See Note 23—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest earned of approximately $70 million on both the litigation escrow, and the portion of the IPO proceeds retained to redeem the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock. See Note 4—Visa Europe and Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This increase was offset by net realized losses and other-than-temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and a money market fund. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 6— Investments and Note 7—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We expect that the level of interest income will decrease following the redemption of shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock which took place in October 2008. Other non-operating income Other non-operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe due to changes in the LIBOR interest rate. See Note 4—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate is a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective income tax rate increased to 40% during the year ended September 30, 2008 from the pro forma 15% during the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of the California special deduction after the IPO, the change in state tax apportionment and a one-time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. Included in accrued litigation on our consolidated balance sheet on September 30, 2008 is approximately $3 billion associated with the American Express settlement, the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters is deferred until the payments are made and thus, as of September 30, 2008, we have a deferred tax asset of $857 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect management’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Prior to our IPO, the State of California, where we are headquartered, historically did not tax a substantial portion of our reported income on the basis that we operated on a cooperative or mutual basis and therefore were eligible for a special deduction. As a result of the IPO and consequent ownership by parties other than our financial institution customers, we are no longer eligible to claim the special deduction, resulting in a tax increase. The tax increase was partially offset by a tax decrease resulting from a change in our state tax apportionment. The change in state tax apportionment resulted in a $115 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. In July 2008, we settled with the California Franchise Tax Board with respect to certain audit issues from 1990 to 2003, which include the eligibility to claim certain items as special deductions, apportionment computation, and research and development credits. As a result of the settlement, 65 Table of Contents unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $46 million, of which $30 million were disallowed and will not be recognized and $16 million were received in cash as a tax refund. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2008 compared to Visa U.S.A. Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 The following discussion of results of operations compares Visa Inc. consolidated results for fiscal 2008, to Visa U.S.A. results for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Visa U.S.A. was deemed the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on October 1, 2007, and therefore Visa U.S.A. results are considered the historical predecessor for those of Visa Inc. Operating Revenues The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Service fees $ 3,061 $ 1,945 $ 1,610 $ 1,116 $ 335 57 % 21 % Data processing fees 2,073 1,416 1,248 657 168 46 % 13 % International transaction fees 1,721 454 398 1,267 56 279 % 14 % Other revenues 569 280 280 289 — 103 % — Volume and support incentives (1,161 ) (505 ) (588 ) (656 ) 83 130 % (14 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 2,948 $ 2,673 $ 642 74 % 22 % Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 The increase in operating revenues during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the inclusion of $2.4 billion of operating revenues from other regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, offset by the absence of data processing and other revenues previously earned from Visa International and Visa Canada. Service fees The increase in service fees during fiscal 2008, is primarily driven by the inclusion of service fees from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $877 million, or 45%. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects U.S. payments volume growth of 11%. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees during fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the inclusion of data processing fees from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $463 million, or 33%. The increase also reflects growth in transaction volumes in the United States, which increased by 12%. Competitive pricing increases primarily related to the Interlink Network also increased data processing fees by 4%. 66 Table of Contents These increases are offset by the absence of data processing revenues previously earned from Visa International regions and Visa Canada. Upon the reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada became direct or indirect subsidiaries of Visa Inc. and these fees are eliminated in consolidation. As noted above, our rate of future revenue growth may be impacted by ongoing consolidation in the financial sector. We also expect that current turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of payments volume and transaction growth, in the near term. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees during fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the inclusion of international transaction fees of acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $1.1 billion, or 233%. Further increases were due to double digit growth in cross-border payments volume reflecting more cross-border transactions and continued expansion in the use of electronic payments for travel purposes. In addition, growth in international transaction fees reflects modifications to pricing structures for certain international transactions in April 2008. As noted above, we expect that current worldwide turbulence in the financial and credit markets will moderate discretionary spending, and the rate of cross-border business and leisure travel, in the near term. Other revenues The increase in other revenues during fiscal 2008 reflects inclusion of other revenues from acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007, which represents an increase of $217 million, or 78%. License fees and fees for other services provided under the framework agreement with Visa Europe, which became effective at the time of the reorganization, represented an increase of $176 million. Growth in other revenues also reflects increased fees related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform in which enrolled Visa cardholders earn reward points toward qualifying purchases. Visa earns revenues from its financial institution customers for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the Visa Extras platform. Growth in other revenues was also impacted by increases in fines associated with our Cardholder Information Security Program for acquirers whose merchants have not yet met compliance standards. During fiscal 2008, these increases were offset by the absence of $160 million in project revenues previously earned for services provided to Visa International regions and Visa Canada in fiscal 2007. Volume and support incentives The inclusion of volume and support incentives from the acquired regions upon the reorganization on October 1, 2007 contributed to the increase in volume and support incentives by $236 million, or 47%. The remainder of the increase in volume and support incentives in the current period was primarily attributable to unusually lower levels of contra revenue recorded in fiscal 2007. The lower volume and support incentives in fiscal 2007 were primarily driven by significant performance adjustments recorded in the period. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies of the acquired regions to that of the accounting acquirer; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in the prior fiscal year. Further detail of these and other factors are provided below. • We recorded downward adjustments of $81 million related to U.S. based volume and support in fiscal 2007 as compared to $15 million in fiscal 2008, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $66 million. 67 Table of Contents • As anticipated, volume and support incentives increased during fiscal 2008 due to a non-recurring charge in the second fiscal quarter related to a customer agreement executed in the period, which increased volume and support incentives by $70 million. • As further anticipated, the accounting impact of volume and support incentives assumed upon the restructuring of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007 increased volume and support incentives by $188 million. • Additional increases in volume and support incentives reflect the impact of new contracts and higher payments volumes and number of transactions processed. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to contracts or new contracts. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The increase in operating revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 primarily reflects a 9% increase in payments volume (exclusive of PIN-based debit volume), and an 11% increase in transactions. Growth in operating revenues exceeded growth in payments and transactions volumes primarily due to newly introduced service fees. While we believe that these changes in fee structure will generate ongoing benefits, we do not believe that the rate of growth in operating revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth because it includes the impacts in fiscal 2007 of the new service fees. Service fees Payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services in the preceding quarter, exclusive of PIN-based debit volume, is the basis for service fees. Payments volume increased $105 billion, or 9%, to $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2007. Service fees outpaced the growth in underlying payments volume due primarily to the April 2007 introduction of new service fees. The increase in service fees from these new fees was offset by the corresponding elimination of previously existing issuer fees used to support merchant acceptance and volume growth initiatives. The net impact of the new service fees and the elimination of the existing issuer fees resulted in an increase to service fees of $190 million, or 12%, in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees The increase in data processing fees is primarily due to the growth in the number of transactions processed during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Data processing fees increased 13%, broadly consistent with the growth in underlying transactions processed. Incremental revenues during fiscal 2007 from the introduction of an updated fraud detection product and additional revenues from Visa U.S.A.’s debit processing services related to non-Visa network transactions offset the continued impact of higher volume-based discounts resulting from consolidation and transaction growth among customers. Of the total data processing fees, $122 million, or 9%, was collectively earned from Visa International, Visa Canada and Visa Europe in each of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. International transaction fees The increase in international transaction fees was primarily driven by cross-border payments volume, which increased by 15%, during fiscal 2007, compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in international transaction fees was broadly in line with the growth in multi-currency payments volume, reflecting more cross-border transactions as overall global travel has increased. 68 Table of Contents Volume and support incentives The decrease in volume and support incentives was primarily due to the impact of lower revised estimates of performance under these agreements during management’s regular quarterly review of customer performance and due to amendments to volume and support incentives during the period. Performance adjustments reduced volume and support incentives cost by a total of $73 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $36 million in fiscal 2006. As the rate of payments volume growth has softened compared to the prior year, estimates of performance under volume and support incentives have been adjusted accordingly. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. Fiscal Year ended September 30, $ Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 Visa U.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,199 $ 721 $ 671 $ 478 $ 50 66 % 7 % Network, EDP and communications 339 249 213 90 36 36 % 17 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,016 581 474 435 107 75 % 23 % Visa International fees — 173 159 (173 ) 14 NM 9 % Professional and consulting fees 438 334 291 104 43 31 % 15 % Depreciation and amortization 237 126 138 111 (12 ) 88 % (9 )% Administrative and other 332 202 249 130 (47 ) 64 % (19 )% Litigation provision 1,470 2,653 23 (1,183 ) 2,630 (45 )% NM Total Operating Expenses $ 5,031 $ 5,039 $ 2,218 $ (8 ) $ 2,821 — % 127 % Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Operating expenses remained flat during fiscal 2008, compared to the prior year comparable period. The increase in our operating expenses due to inclusion of operating expenses attributed to the acquired regions of $1.3 billion was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of $1.2 billion. Personnel The increase in personnel expense during fiscal 2008 over the prior year comparable period was primarily due to: • $376 million in personnel expense attributed to the acquired regions; • $93 million in severance charges related to workforce consolidation due to the elimination of overlapping functions directly connected to the reorganization; and • $74 million in stock based compensation expense reflecting stock-based incentives awarded to our employees in connection with our IPO. These increases were offset by reductions in personnel and other incentive expense primarily due to changes in our defined benefit pension plan since the prior year comparable period and the absence of a special IPO incentive incurred during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. 69 Table of Contents Due to the deterioration in market conditions and the resulting impact on the fair value of our pension plan assets upon remeasurement at September 30, 2008, we expect that our pension plan expense will increase in fiscal 2009. Also, we continue to evaluate various alternatives for achieving synergies in the global organization and expect to incur additional severance charges, which may be significant, in fiscal 2009. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense during fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $71 million attributed to the acquired regions. The remainder of the increase reflects higher software maintenance and hardware rental expense following the outsourcing of certain development functions during fiscal 2007. Maintenance and equipment rental costs may continue to increase over time as we continue to evaluate outsourcing alternatives for certain support functions. Advertising, marketing and promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion during fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $486 million in advertising, marketing and promotion expense attributed to the acquired regions and higher advertising and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics coupled with increased promotional activity related to our Visa Extras reward program. These increases were offset by the absence of $67 million of costs incurred during fiscal 2007 to support certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers which did not recur during fiscal 2008. Visa International fees Visa International fees ceased as a result of the reorganization, as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International both became direct subsidiaries of Visa Inc. Professional and consulting fees The increase in professional and consulting fees primarily reflects increases of $72 million attributed to the acquired regions during fiscal 2008. Depreciation and amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization primarily reflects increases of $118 million attributed to the acquired regions during fiscal 2008. Software amortization expense would be expected to increase over time as we are committed to maintaining and enhancing our networks as well as to developing new payment products. Administrative and other The increase in administrative and other expense during fiscal 2008, primarily reflects increases of $177 million, attributed to the acquired regions, offset by the absence of $63 million in facilities expense paid to the real estate joint ventures owned by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, which were consolidated as part of Visa Inc. following the reorganization. Litigation provision The decrease in litigation provision primarily reflects (i) the absence of a $1.9 billion provision related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, offset by (ii) an increase during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2008 of $1.1 billion to our 70 Table of Contents litigation provision in connection with settlement of litigation with Discover Financial Services. Since both of these matters are covered by the Company’s Retrospective Responsibility Plan, responsibility for the settlement is allocated to the Company’s class B shareholders via an escrow account and other mechanisms previously established under the Plan. The increase also reflects additional accruals made in fiscal 2008 under the provisions of SFAS 5, related to the covered litigation. See Note 23—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Total operating expenses increased by 127% to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase primarily reflects the $2.7 billion litigation provision recorded during the year, which represented 94% of that increase. Excluding the litigation provision, operating expenses increased $191 million, or 9%. Personnel Personnel expense increased 4% in fiscal 2007 due to a $26 million charge representing the first installment of a one-time special bonus program of $51 million associated with the establishment of Visa Inc. Half of the $51 million special bonus program vested during fiscal 2007. The other half is payable in stock or cash one year after the completion of the initial public offering if certain vesting requirements are met. The remaining increase of 3% reflects severance expense for certain executives, annual salary adjustments, which were broadly in line with economic price increases, offset by the impact of lower average headcount during fiscal 2007. Network, EDP and communications The increase in network, EDP and communications expense for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: • a $29 million increase in fees paid for debit processing services for charges related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks; and • a $12 million increase in maintenance and equipment rental costs. Fees for data processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks would be expected to grow over time as the worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic payments continues. Advertising, marketing and promotion The increase in advertising, marketing and promotion expense in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the following: • a $67 million increase in expenditures for certain joint promotional campaigns with financial institution customers; and • a $23 million increase in expenditures associated with Visa Extras, Visa U.S.A.’s point-based rewards program that enables enrolled cardholders to earn reward points on qualifying purchases. Visa International fees Although Visa U.S.A.’s percentage of worldwide payments volumes decreased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to global emerging markets experiencing higher payments volume growth rates than the more mature U.S. economy, fees paid to Visa International increased due to a one-time fee waiver of $13 million in fiscal 2006 that was not repeated in fiscal 2007. 71 Table of Contents Professional and consulting fees Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following: • a $23 million increase in contractors and outsourcing expense in connection with the outsourcing of certain data processing and development functions over the course of fiscal 2007, and additional contractors in connection with the support of other development and maintenance projects; and • a $19 million increase in legal fees incurred to support ongoing litigation matters. Depreciation and amortization The decrease in depreciation and amortization during fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the absence of a $13 million impairment charge for the net carrying value of an intangible asset associated with the patent and rights to market and distribute Mini Cards in the United States incurred during fiscal 2006. Administrative and other Administrative and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the absence of the following expenses incurred in fiscal 2006: • a $24 million charge to reimburse customers for production and issuance costs related to discontinued use of Visa-branded cards with the holographic magnetic stripe design; and • an $11 million charge to reflect expenses for business objectives related to a litigation settlement in fiscal 2006. The settlement required Visa U.S.A. to either meet certain joint business objectives or make cash payments in lieu of the business objectives over five years. Because Visa U.S.A. expects to make these related cash payments without receiving future benefits, Visa U.S.A. charged the present value of the total payments to its consolidated statements of operations in fiscal 2006. Litigation provision Litigation provision increased $2.6 billion reflecting a $1.9 billion provision related to settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express. Future payments under the settlement agreement were discounted at 4.72% over the payment term to determine the amount of the provision. The litigation provision also reflects management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS 5 related to the Discover litigation. The American Express and Discover litigations are covered by our Retrospective Responsibility Plan and we intend to fund any payment obligations with amounts in the escrow account, in accordance with our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. The remainder of the increase in litigation provision includes various litigation provisions for both settled and unsettled matters. 72 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $Change % Change Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 VisaU.S.A.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ 1 $ 40 $ 13 $ (39 ) $ 27 (98 )% 208 % Interest expense (143 ) (81 ) (89 ) (62 ) 8 77 % (9 )% Investment income, net 211 103 68 108 35 105 % 51 % Other 35 — — 35 — NM NA Total Other Income (Expense) $ 104 $ 62 $ (8 ) $ 42 $ 70 68 % NM Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates The decrease in other non-operating income is primarily due to the absence of equity in earnings of Visa International which was acquired in the reorganization. Interest expense The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to interest accretion attributed to the American Express settlement. See Note 23—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net primarily reflects income attributed to the acquired regions, as well as interest income on a portion of the IPO proceeds to be used for redemption of the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock and interest income on the litigation escrow account. See Note 4—Visa Europe and Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This increase was offset by realized losses and other-than-temporary impairment of $68 million on investments and a money market fund. See Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 6—Investments and Note 7—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. We expect that the level of interest income will decrease following the redemption of the shares of class C (series II) and class C (series III) common stock which took place in October 2008. Other non-operating income Other non-operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects a change in the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe due to changes in the LIBOR interest rate. See Note 4—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 Other income was $62 million in fiscal 2007 compared to other expense of $8 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in other income primarily reflected an increase in Visa U.S.A.’s portion of equity 73 Table of Contents earnings from Visa International as a result of an increase in net income for Visa International and an increase in interest income as the result of a shift in Visa U.S.A.’s investment portfolio from tax-exempt securities to higher yielding money market and auction rate securities. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected higher Visa International net income during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year. Interest expense The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected lower accretion expense on the declining litigation balance in the Retailers’ Litigation matter. See Note 23—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Investment income, net The increase in investment income, net in fiscal 2007 primarily reflected an increase in interest income due to a shift in the Visa U.S.A.’s investment strategy from tax-exempt municipal bonds to higher yield fixed-income investment securities and to higher average investment balances during the year. Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007 Visa Inc.’s effective tax rate is a combination of federal, state and foreign statutory rates and certain required adjustments to taxable income. The effective tax rate was 40% for the year ended September 30, 2008, compared to Visa U.S.A.’s 23% for the year ended September 30, 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of the California special deduction after the IPO, the change in state tax apportionment, and a one-time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. Fiscal 2007 compared to Fiscal 2006 The effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 of 23% represented a tax benefit while the effective rate of 35% for the prior year represented a tax expense. The 23% effective tax rate benefit in fiscal 2007 resulted from the loss before income tax realized for the year. This benefit was less than what would otherwise have been realized, primarily as a result of an adjustment to a reserve related to litigation. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2007 2006 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (in millions, except percentages) (Loss) income before income taxes and minority interest $ (1,387 ) $ 722 Minority interest 5 16 U.S. federal statutory tax (485 ) 35 % 253 35 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit (11 ) 1 % (11 ) (1 )% Reserve for tax uncertainties related to litigation 180 (13 )% — — Non-deductible expenses and other differences 2 — % 15 2 % Minority interest—not subject to tax (2 ) — % (6 ) (1 )% Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (316 ) 23 % $ 251 35 % 74 Table of Contents Visa U.S.A.’s fiscal 2007 consolidated statement of operations reflected a litigation provision of $2.7 billion associated with its outstanding and settled litigation. This provision primarily reflected the amount required to settle the American Express litigation and management’s liability estimate under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. For tax purposes, the deduction related to these matters will be deferred until the payments are made and thus we established a deferred tax asset of $778 million related to these payments, which is net of a reserve to reflect Visa U.S.A.’s best estimate of the amount of the benefit to be realized. Minority Interest The decrease in minority interest for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year reflects lower Inovant net income as a result of charges for severance and termination benefits related to Visa U.S.A.’s plans to outsource certain data processing and development support functions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity Prior to our reorganization, Visa U.S.A., Visa International and Visa Canada each managed their own short-term and long-term liquidity needs. With the completion of the reorganization, we now manage our corporate finance and treasury functions on an integrated basis. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of these treasury policies are to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingent scenarios, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments and to optimize income earned within acceptable risk parameters. Based on our cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. Management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 75 Table of Contents Consolidated Balance Sheet Data The following table sets forth summarized balance sheet data for Visa Inc. at September 30, 2008 and at October 1, 2007, the date of the reorganization, and a historical balance sheet data for Visa U.S.A, deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination, at September 30, 2007: September 30, 2008(Visa Inc.)

Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2008 and historical cash flows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007(1) Fiscal 2006(1) (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 531 $ 505 $ 450 Investing activities 554 (463 ) (278 ) Financing activities 3,624 (37 ) (37 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5 ) — — Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,704 $ 5 $ 135 (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. Inc., deemed the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Operating Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 was $531 million. This amount was lower than income provided by operations primarily due to: • Use of cash of $92 million reflecting settlement transactions. The change in net settlement receivables and payables relates to timing differences, processed volume changes and 76 Table of Contents exchange rate fluctuations. Given the proximity of the 2008 fiscal year end to a weekend, we carried a higher level of multi-currency transactions in our net settlement balances. This use of cash represents the net of the increases in settlement receivable and increases in settlement payable during fiscal 2008; • Use of cash reflecting annual compensation benefit payments, offset by accruals for current fiscal year compensation benefits, reflected as a reduction of $115 million in accrued compensation; and • Use of cash reflecting volume and support incentive payments of $1,378 million, off-set by amortization on volume and support incentives of $1,161 million, for a net use of cash of $217 million. These uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable on income provided by operations, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items, as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Fiscal 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $55 million in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year. The increase primarily reflected the absence of a substantial program payment in connection with Visa U.S.A.’s Visa Check card program in the prior year. The increase also reflects higher non-cash accruals for accrued compensation and benefits. Investing Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by investing activities was $554 million for fiscal 2008. Cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect $1,002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization and net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities of $949 million due to a shift in investments from debt securities to shorter-term cash equivalents. We also purchased property, equipment and technology of $415 million primarily related to the new data center under construction on the east coast, contributed $25 million to other investments and received distributions of $22 million from other investments. In addition, in September 2008, our $953 million investment in the Primary Reserve Fund was reclassified from cash equivalents to other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under “Sources of Liquidity,” below, and Note 7—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Fiscal 2007 The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 is primarily driven by facilities and equipment purchases related to the new data center discussed above. In addition, investment securities purchasing activity, net of sales and maturities, was higher during fiscal 2007. Financing Activities Fiscal 2008 Cash provided by financing activities was $3,624 million for fiscal 2008. This amount includes IPO related activities as follows: • Source of cash reflecting proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock of $19.1 billion, net of issuance costs of $550 million; 77 Table of Contents • Use of cash reflecting the partial redemption of class B and class C (series I) common stock of $13.4 billion; and • Use of cash reflecting the payment to the litigation escrow account of $3.0 billion for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1,085 million, reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by use of cash of $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Fiscal 2007 Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 primarily reflects scheduled quarterly payments on Visa U.S.A.’s series A senior secured notes due December 2007 and series B senior secured notes due December 2012. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt or equity. Our current cash flow strategy is to provide timely settlement payments due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers, to pay off debt (including litigation settlements), to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of the our board of directors, and to invest excess cash in securities that we believe are high-quality and marketable in the short term. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, a fixed income investment portfolio comprised primarily of highly rated debt instruments, cash flow from operating activities and access to various borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. At September 30, 2008, October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2007 our total liquid assets, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term available-for-sale investment securities, and our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund (“the fund”), discussed further below, included in prepaid and other current assets at September 30, 2008, were $6.5 billion, $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. We hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities, asset backed securities, money market funds, equity securities and cost and equity method investments. The recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings. In September 2008, the fund (as defined above) was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling $983 million, and the fund was subsequently placed into liquidation. The fund announced that its per-share value would drop below $1.00 per share as a result 78 Table of Contents of losses in certain of its holdings in debt securities of Lehman Brothers, who on September 15, 2008 filed for bankruptcy. The fund also announced that it would liquidate its assets and distribute funds to investors on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor. We understand that the fund issuer and financial markets are working on a number of alternatives in order for shareholders to recover their investment. The investment in the fund was originally recorded as a cash equivalent on our consolidated balance sheet. At September 30, 2008, we consider our shares in this fund to represent an equity investment for which a market price is not readily determinable. Therefore, the investment is accounted for under the cost method of accounting and classified as an other current asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Upon reclassification to other current assets, we recorded the investment at fair value with the resulting loss recorded as investment income, net. We estimated the fair value of this investment by discounting the fund’s underlying holdings of securities based upon an estimate of risk inherent to those holdings. Using this method, we recorded a write-down of approximately $30 million in our fourth fiscal quarter which was recorded in investment income, net on our consolidated statements of operations. This write-down reflects a per share price of approximately $0.97 at September 30, 2008. In October 2008, an estimated share price of $0.97 for the fund was reported by the fund manager. On October 31, 2008 we received an initial distribution of $499 million, or 52%, of the total $953 million investment recorded at September 30, 2008. Based upon the fund’s underlying holdings of securities, it is expected that we will receive the remaining liquidation proceeds over the next 12 months. However, it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of these distributions with certainty. We expect that the balances we held in our other money market funds as of September 19, 2008 will be covered by the Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds announced by the United States Treasury on September 29, 2008. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Factors that may impact liquidity include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted. Recent U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment instrument. A portion of the proceeds from our IPO are held in an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. See Note 5—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2008 was $1,928 million and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet ($1,298 million in current assets and $630 million in long-term assets). As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under “Uses of Liquidity.” 79 Table of Contents Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain class B and class C stockholders and certain of our customers or affiliates of our customers. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There have been no borrowings under this facility. At September 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility. U.S. commercial paper programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. At September 30, 2008, we had no obligations outstanding under this program. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Medium-term note program. Visa International has established a medium-term note program authorizing the issuance of a maximum of $250 million of unsecured, private placement notes. The notes may be issued with maturities from nine months to 30 years at fixed or floating interest rates. At September 30, 2008, we had notes outstanding in an aggregate amount of $40 million, which mature in August 2009 and have a fixed interest rate of 7.53%. Interest expense on the outstanding notes for fiscal 2008 was approximately $3 million. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2008, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s rated our long-term and short-term unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’s Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long-term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short-term unsecured debt A-1 Stable P-1 Stable Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 80 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement requirements. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from the payments settlement of certain credit and debit transactions and the timing of payments settlement between financial institution customers with settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. During fiscal 2008, we funded average daily net settlement receivable balances of $157 million, with the highest daily balance being $455 million. Litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. We have a Retrospective Responsibility Plan to address settlements and judgments arising from covered litigation. As part of the plan, we deposited $3.0 billion of our IPO proceeds into an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be paid. The amount deposited in the escrow account caused the conversion ratio of class B shares to shares of class A common stock to decline. We may be directed by the litigation committee to conduct additional sales of class A common stock in order to increase the escrow amount, in which case the conversion rate of the class B common stock will be subject to an additional dilutive adjustment to the extent of the number of additional class A common shares sold. The litigation committee was established pursuant to a litigation management agreement among Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International and the members of the litigation committee, all of whom are affiliated with, or act for, certain Visa U.S.A. members. The litigation committee may recommend or refer the cash payment portion of a proposed settlement of any covered litigation to the Visa Inc. board of directors. It is our intention to take steps during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to fund our escrow account with an additional approximate $1.1 billion. Under our Retrospective Responsibility Plan, our class B shareholders will bear the cost of funding the litigation escrow account via a further dilutive adjustment in the conversion ratio of their class B shares to shares of class A common stock, reducing the total number of diluted class A shares outstanding for purposes of calculating EPS. On November 14, 2008 we filed a definitive proxy with the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to amend our charter to permit us to deposit operating cash directly into the litigation escrow account with a corresponding reduction in the conversion ratio applicable to our class B common shares. Funding the litigation escrow account in this manner would also effectively act as a share repurchase program in the amount of $1.1 billion. In the event that the proxy is not approved by our shareholders it is our intention to fund the litigation escrow with an additional approximate $1.1 billion through an underwritten public offering under the established terms of our Retrospective Responsibility Plan. In March 2008, we recorded an additional litigation provision of $285 million related to the covered litigation as a charge against income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we also recorded a provision of $1.1 billion related to the Discover litigation in connection with an agreement to settle pending litigation with Discover Financial Services. The determination to record both additional provisions was based on management’s present understanding of its litigation profile and the specifics of each case and takes into account the determination of the litigation committee. Together with Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, we entered into an agreement with American Express that became effective on November 9, 2007 to settle litigation, American Express Travel Related Services Co., Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc. et al, that had been pending since 2004. The settlement ended all current litigation between American Express and Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, as well as the related litigation between American Express and five co-defendant banks. Under the settlement 81 Table of Contents agreement, American Express will receive maximum payments of $2.25 billion, including up to $2.07 billion from us and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. An initial payment of $1.13 billion was made in March 2008, including $945 million from us and $185 million from the five co-defendant banks. Beginning April 1, 2008, we are required to pay American Express an additional amount of up to $70 million each quarter for 16 quarters, for a maximum total of $1.12 billion, contingent on American Express meeting certain performance criteria. All payments related to this covered litigation settlement will be funded out of the litigation escrow account. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our retailers’ litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we are required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. Redemption of class B and class C common stock. In March 2008, we redeemed 154,738,487 shares of class B common stock for $6,618 million and 159,657,751 shares of class C (series I) common stock for $6,828 million. Subsequent to our fiscal year end, on October 10, 2008, we completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of class C (series II) common stock and 35,263,585 shares of our class C (series III) common stock held by Visa Europe for $2,646 million, less dividends and certain other adjustments. Dividends. On June 11, 2008, our board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis) resulting in a payment of $93 million on August 29, 2008. On October 14, 2008 our board of directors declared a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.105 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-coverted basis). We expect to pay approximately $80 million in connection with this dividend in December 2008. See Note 16—Stockholders’ Equity and Redeemable Shares to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information regarding the dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to $0.42 per share of class A common stock (representing an ongoing quarterly rate equal to $0.105 per share). Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put-call option agreement. We have granted Visa Europe a put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time after March 25, 2009. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies the 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12-month period. Upon exercise of the put option, we will be obligated, subject only to regulatory approvals and other limited conditions, to pay the purchase price within 285 days in cash or, at our option, with a combination of cash and shares of our publicly tradable common stock. The portion of the purchase price we will be able to pay in stock will initially be limited to 43.8% based upon the redemption of class C (series I) common stock and will be reduced to the extent of any further redemptions of, or exceptions made by the directors to the transfer restrictions applicable to, the class C (series I) common stock. We must pay the purchase price in cash if the settlement of the put option occurs after March 25, 2011. We will incur a substantial financial obligation if Visa Europe exercises the put option, and we may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment, which would be due 285 days after exercise. At September 30, 2008, the fair value of the put option liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we 82 Table of Contents may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, the 12 month projected sustainable net operating income of Visa Europe, the allocation of cost synergies, the trading price of our class A common stock, and our 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple, in each case, as determined at the time the put option is exercised. We are not currently able to estimate the amount of this obligation due to the nature and number of factors involved and the range of important assumptions that would be required. However, depending upon Visa Europe’s level of sustainable profitability and/or our 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple at the time of any exercise of the option, the amount of this obligation could be several billion dollars or more. See Note 4—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and the employees’ final three to five years of earnings, as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents that meet minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under ERISA. Our postretirement plan is funded on a current basis. We typically fund our pension plan in September of each year. In September 2008 and 2007 we made contributions to our pension and postretirement plans of $190 million and $65 million, respectively. In fiscal 2009 we intend to fund our defined benefits pension plan and postretirement benefit plan by approximately $70 million. Capital expenditures. We are building a new data center on the east coast of the United States at a current estimated cost of $390 million, of which we expect to capitalize approximately $335 million. In fiscal 2007, we completed the purchase of a parcel of land and commenced construction, which is expected to continue through fiscal 2009. Upon completion, we will migrate our current east coast data center to this new facility. The new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. At September 30, 2008, we had incurred total costs of $264 million related to the new data center. We have remaining committed obligations of $70 million, which is expected to be paid in fiscal 2009. The remaining $56 million of uncommitted estimated costs is expected to be paid in fiscal 2009 and 2010. We will also continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure, some of which we treat as capital expenditures. Other uses of liquidity. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2008, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $106 million. Certain charges directly connected to the reorganization will affect our results of operations in future periods. These charges, which may be significant, will include charges during fiscal 2009 related to workforce consolidation due to elimination of overlapping functions. We expect to fund these activities with existing liquid assets and projected operating cash flows. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees. Visa Inc. has no off-balance sheet debt, other than operating leases and purchase order commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. 83 Table of Contents Guarantees Our financial institution customers are responsible for settlement of transactions with other customers. However, under the bylaws of Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, and through separate membership agreements with the individual financial institution customers, these entities indemnify issuing and acquiring customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other issuing and acquiring customer to honor drafts, traveler’s cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with their operating regulations. This indemnification is unlimited and is the result of the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. To manage the settlement risk under this indemnification and the resulting risk to all financial institution customers, a formalized set of credit standards is used to review financial institution customers. To reduce potential losses related to settlement risk, Visa Inc. requires certain financial institution customers to post collateral that may include cash equivalents, securities, letters of credit or guarantees in order to ensure their performance of settlement obligations. Our estimated settlement exposure, after consideration of customer collateral obtained, amounted to approximately $34.8 billion at September 30, 2008. The exposure to settlement losses not covered by customer collateral is accounted for as a settlement risk guarantee. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 13—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The fair value of the settlement risk guarantee was under $1 million at September 30, 2008. In October 2001, Visa International entered into a 20-year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. On July 1, 2004, upon the incorporation of the EU region as VESI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, the entire lease was assigned to VESI with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by United Kingdom property law under the existing lease. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make lease payments. The base rent commitment is £8 million each year or $14 million in U.S. dollars (based on the September 30, 2008 exchange rate). VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa International’s guarantee to the landlord. Since the inception of this arrangement, Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee. The estimated fair value of this guarantee was under $1 million at September 30, 2008. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial. 84 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on-and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2008. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances, proceeds from our IPO, and available credit facilities.

(2) Visa Inc. leases certain premises such as its data centers, certain regional offices, equipment and software under non-cancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Visa Inc. generally has non-cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to 13 years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher payments and transaction volumes in connection with these agreements. These amounts are estimates and could change based on customer performance. (4) Visa Inc. is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from less than one year to 8 years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. (5) Represents amounts due in accordance with settlement agreements in the Retailers’ Litigation, American Express, Discover and other litigation settlements. (6) In October 2008, we redeemed all of the class C (series II) common stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1.1 billion (subject to reduction for dividends and other adjustments) and we redeemed 35,263,585 shares of class C (series III) common stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1.5 billion. See Note 16—Stockholders’ Equity and Redeemable Shares. (7) Represents payments on medium-term notes, 2002 series B senior secured notes, 1994 and 1995 series B secured notes. See Note 11—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 85 Table of Contents Effective October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. At September 30, 2008, the liability for uncertain tax positions, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of state and foreign income taxes was $376 million. At September 30, 2008, we also accrued $5 million of interest and $1 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made within the next twelve months associated with our uncertain tax positions. Also see Note 11—Debt, Note 20—Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 23—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Related Parties During fiscal 2008, a significant portion of our operating revenues were generated from four customers with officers who also serve on our board of directors. Operating revenues from these customers were approximately $538 million, or 9%, of our operating revenues for fiscal 2008. No customer accounted for 10% or more of Visa Inc.’s total operating revenues during this period. The loss of any of these customers could adversely impact our operating revenues and operating income going forward. See Note 21—Related Parties to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. One of the Company’s directors, and the spouse of another of the Company’s directors, are also officers of entities that participated in (or are affiliated with an entity that participated in) our IPO as underwriters, and one of those entities is also one of our customers. As underwriters, each was offered and purchased 113 million shares of class A common stock at a price of $42.77 per share, a discount of $1.23 per share based on the IPO price of $44.00 per share. This price per share is the same as that paid by all underwriters in the IPO. Also as underwriters, each received total underwriter fees from us of $139 million in March 2008. We are also a party to numerous agreements with Visa Europe, a holder of our class C common stock, which allow each entity to provide services to the other at negotiated fees, including the allocation of costs for office premises which are shared by us and Visa Europe. For fiscal 2008, total operating revenues and operating expenses related to Visa Europe totaled $221 million and $7 million, respectively. At September 30, 2008, Visa Europe owed us approximately $3 million in net accounts receivable. See Note 4—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Also see Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” included elsewhere in this report. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and is included elsewhere in this report. We have established policies and control procedures to seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. 86 Table of Contents We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions Revenue Recognition—Volume and Support Incentives We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are fixed payments and are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit. Volume and support incentives require significant management estimates. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our customers. If our customers’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable and is recorded as a reduction of revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2008 performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were approximately 0.2% of our operating revenues. Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option We have granted Visa Europe a put option under which Visa Inc. is required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time after March 25, 2009. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies the 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the same 12-month period. We determined the fair value of the put option using probability weighted models designed to estimate our liability The determination of the fair value of the put option requires significant estimates and assumptions. The most significant of these estimates are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the 12-month forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise of 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of one in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. 87 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions assuming various possible exercise decisions that Visa Europe could make, including the possibility it will never exercise its option, under different economic conditions in the future. Using this approach, the estimated fair value is approximately $346 million at September 30, 2008 and is included in other liabilities on the Visa Inc. consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2008. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option was exercised, which would likely be significantly in excess of this amount. Fair Value—Goodwill and Intangibles The purchase method of accounting for business combinations and associated impairment assessment requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We are required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment subsequently. Valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets require the use of management’s judgment. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management. We believe that the assumptions made in this regard are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was $21.1 billion, including $10.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at September 30, 2008. 88 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions considerable management judgment and is based on the evaluation of a number of factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic factors. We determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Impairment testing for goodwill requires us to assign assets and liabilities to reporting units along with estimating future cash flows for those reporting units based on assumptions of future events. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (SFAS 5). We record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases, significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 89 Table of Contents Critical Estimates Assumptions and Judgment Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. In determining our liability under SFAS 5 for covered litigation under the Retrospective Responsibility Plan, we also evaluate the actions taken by the litigation committee including its decisions regarding the establishment and funding of the escrow account. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The adoption of FASB interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” required us to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits of $317 million and $857 million, respectively, associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the recognition of a liability under the guidelines of SFAS No. 5 related to the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 23—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. 90 Table of Contents Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP No. FAS 157-2”), Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (“FSP FAS 157-2”), which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have evaluated the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our financial assets and liabilities and do not believe that the standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption on October 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements of adopting FSP FAS 157-2 on our non-financial assets and liabilities. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment to SFAS 115 (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 allows the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis under a fair value option. In addition, SFAS 159 includes an amendment of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2007. Effective October 1, 2008, we elected the fair value option for certain investment securities which are held in connection with employee compensation plans. These securities will be reported as trading securities with changes in fair value recorded as other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51 (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 requires that the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent and the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income, changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently, and that any retained noncontrolling equity investment in a deconsolidated former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value. SFAS 160 also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R changes the accounting for business combinations including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent consideration, the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs, the accounting for preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, and the recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 141R on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 changes the 91 Table of Contents disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS 161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 161 on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (“FSP FAS 142-3”). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting FSP FAS 142-3 on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“SFAS 162”). SFAS 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting principles to be used in the preparation and presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. SFAS 162 will be effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”). FSP EITF 03-6-1 addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008; earlier application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting FSP EITF 03-6-1 on our results of operations and earnings per share. In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 133-1 and FIN 45-4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161 (“FSP 133-1 and FIN 45-4”). FSP 133-1 and FIN 45-4 is intended to improve disclosures about credit derivatives by requiring more information about the potential adverse effects of changes in credit risk on the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the sellers of credit derivatives. It amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (“SFAS 133”), to require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in hybrid instruments. The FSP also amends FIN 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others (“FIN 45”), to require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a guarantee. The provisions of the FSP that amend SFAS 133 and FIN 45 are effective for reporting periods (annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. Lastly, the FSP clarifies the effective date of SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, as any reporting period (annual or quarterly interim) beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this FSP on our consolidated financial statements. 92 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from changes in market factors. We believe we are exposed to four significant market risks that could affect our business including: changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Recent U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets, causing global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies and procedures that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment instrument. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our business is conducted globally. Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currency-denominated transactions, and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for costs and expenses at our non-U.S. locations. These risks are managed by utilizing derivative foreign currency forward and option contracts, which we refer to as foreign currency contracts. Foreign currency contracts are primarily designated as hedges of operational cash flow exposures which result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At September 30, 2008, the currency underlying the foreign currency contracts consists of the British pound sterling. Prior to the reorganization, Visa U.S.A. did not engage in foreign currency hedges. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. The foreign currency exchange risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. We do not consider investment securities which are classified as cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant market risks from a fair value perspective, as amounts consist of liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Because we have historically had the ability to hold investments until maturity, operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. 93 Table of Contents The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2008 include: September 30, 2008Visa Inc. 2007Visa U.S.A.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the Visa U.S.A.’s investment portfolio by approximately $7 million or $2 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $103 million and $152 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We have a credit facility to provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our customers and other operational needs. This credit facility has variable rates which are applied to borrowings based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. There was no amount outstanding at September 30, 2008 under the credit facility. We have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately $2 million at September 30, 2008. Equity Price Risk We own equity securities which are selected to offset obligations in connection with our long-term incentive and deferred compensation plans. Equity securities primarily consist of mutual fund investments related to various employee compensation plans. For these plans, employees bear the risk of market fluctuations. Realized gains and losses or other-than-temporary impairments experienced on these equity investments are recorded in investment income, net on our consolidated statements of operations, and are offset by increases or reductions in personnel expense, respectively. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in market value would have increased or decreased unrealized losses and personnel expense, respectively, by $9 million and $5 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We have a liability related to the put-call option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2008. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2008, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of one in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. 94 Table of Contents Pension Plan Assets Risk Our total defined benefit pension plan assets were $624 million and $604 million at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Although these assets are not included in our financial statements, a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders’ equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan, increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets, and increases in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2009, which we expect to make in September 2009. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Historical and Pro Forma Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report. 95 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:13.327100
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2009,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition, the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and “the Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing customers and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. In order to respond to industry dynamics and enhance Visa’s ability to compete, we consummated a reorganization in October 2007, and in March 2008 completed our IPO. The global alignment of various functions and best practices provides us the business scale to effectively deliver our existing core products across more and different geographies and to accelerate the delivery of product innovations across different market segments. Overall Economic Conditions Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of payments volume growth, in the near term. Regulatory measures enacted in the United States during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 expected to take effect in fiscal 2010 will impact our financial institution customers. Should financial institutions constrict credit offerings in response to these measures, this could ultimately impact consumer spending and our payments volumes. However, we believe that the continuing secular shift to electronic payment products for non-discretionary spending will buffer the impact to our overall payments volume growth. This shift is particularly clear in debit products, where Visa has a strong market position in the United States and significant growth opportunities internationally. Funding of the Litigation Escrow Account During December 2008 and July 2009, we deposited $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, into the litigation escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) previously established under the Retrospective Responsibility Plan (the “Plan”). Under the terms of the Plan, when Visa funds the Escrow Account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our U.S. financial institution customers and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On that basis, fundings of the Escrow Account in December 2008 and July 2009 had the effect of repurchasing 20,800,824 and 11,578,878 class A common stock equivalents, respectively. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan In October 2009 our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010, and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Sale of Investment in Companhia Brasileira de Meois de Pagamento (“VisaNet do Brasil”) In June 2009, Visa International Service Association, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company sold its 10% ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in connection with its initial public offering. As a result of this transaction, we received approximately $1 billion in net proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $473 million in investment income, net on our statement of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $237 million. Following their initial public offering, we amended an existing agreement with VisaNet do Brasil which grants a license to use Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We expect the license fees to be earned during fiscal 2010 to offset the loss of dividend income as a result of the sale of our ownership interest. Expansion of Our Processing Capabilities Expanding our processing capabilities worldwide is a core component of our long-term growth strategy. As part of this strategy, we created Visa Processing Services Pte. Ltd. (“VPS”), a joint venture with Yalamanchili International Pte. Ltd. (“Yalamanchili”). We hold a 70% interest in VPS. Yalamanchili is a payments processor and software company with operations in Asia. VPS will allow us to extend our industry-leading processing capabilities in geographies where electronic payments are growing rapidly, providing multi-currency and multi-language debit, credit and prepaid processing services to financial institutions, processors and payment companies. VPS will also have capabilities to provide ATM, money transfer and private label processing, as well as a range of payments services, including risk and fraud management, mobile applications, loyalty and cardholder support. VPS provides prepaid and debit processing solutions and complements our Debit Processing Service. Nominal Payments Volume and Transaction Counts We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. As anticipated, for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year over year nominal payments volume impact. 35 Table of Contents This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1): U.S.A.

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balances access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution customers, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter is assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: 2009 2008 % Change (in millions) Total transactions 39,885 36,956 8 % 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payment volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring customers, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from customers for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our customers globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. International transaction revenues are assessed to customers on transactions where the cardholder’s issuer country is different from the merchant’s country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services, cardholder services and fees for licensing and certification. Other revenues also include revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions of operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock-based compensation, incentives and various fringe benefits. Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships, and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Visa International fees represents fees that Visa U.S.A. paid to Visa International prior to our reorganization for services primarily related to global brand management, global product enhancements, management of global system development and interoperability, and corporate support to the entire Visa enterprise. These fees ceased as a result of our reorganization. 37 Table of Contents Professional and consulting fees consist of fees for consulting, contractors, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our reorganization. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate, and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost and equity method investments. Other non-operating income primarily relates to the change in fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. This liability was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 and Visa U.S.A. Fiscal 2007 The following discussion of results of operations compares Visa Inc. consolidated results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 and Visa U.S.A. results for fiscal 2007. Visa U.S.A. was the accounting acquirer in the reorganization that took place on October 1, 2007, and therefore Visa U.S.A. results are considered the historical predecessor for those of Visa Inc., and are included for comparison. Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the U.S., throughout the rest of the world, and from Visa Europe. Operating revenues for periods prior to October 1, 2007 are for Visa U.S.A., and are not presented in the table below, Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe.

U.S. revenues also reflect volume and support incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. A significant portion of the revenues we earn outside the United States results from cross-border business and leisure travel, which has moderated in the current economic environment. Revenues from processing foreign currency transactions for our customers fluctuate with cross-border travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Our operating revenues are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Operating revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to local or regional currencies in which our payments volumes are denominated. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2009 over the prior year resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues, including the impact from our hedging activities. The decline primarily impacted service and international transaction revenues. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) Visa Inc.2009 Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,174 $ 3,061 $ 1,945 $ 113 $ 1,116 4 % 57 % Data processing revenues 2,430 2,073 1,416 357 657 17 % 46 % International transaction revenues 1,916 1,721 454 195 1,267 11 % 279 % Other revenues 625 569 280 56 289 10 % 104 % Volume and support incentives (1,234 ) (1,161 ) (505 ) (73 ) (656 ) 6 % 130 % Total Operating Revenues $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 3,590 $ 648 $ 2,673 10 % 74 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. Revenue growth in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects a moderate increase in nominal payments volume, solid growth of processed transactions and strategic pricing modifications. Operating revenues increased during fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007, primarily due to the inclusion of operating revenues from acquired regions, double digit growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border nominal payments volume, combined with competitive pricing adjustments. The discussion below comparing fiscal 2008 and 2007 focuses on factors other than the inclusion of $2.4 billion of the acquired regions’ operating revenues in fiscal 2008. • Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of the year, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. Service revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to 2007 primarily reflecting nominal U.S. payments volume growth of 11%. We expect that soft economic conditions will continue to moderate consumer and commercial spending, and our rate of nominal payments volume growth, in the near term. • Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the number of transactions processed of 8% during the year, combined with strategic pricing modifications. Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a growth of 12% in transaction volumes, coupled with competitive pricing adjustments related to the Interlink Network. We believe that the secular shift to electronic payments will continue on a global basis. 39 Table of Contents • International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross-border nominal payments volume, primarily due to competitive pricing modifications made since fiscal 2008. International transaction revenues increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting 22% growth in cross-border nominal payments volume and modifications to pricing structures for certain transactions in April 2008. We regularly review our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our customers. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross-border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions would hinder this growth. • Other revenues increased during fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily due to growth in revenues related to the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. The increase in other revenues during fiscal 2008 also reflects license and other service fees from Visa Europe following the reorganization, offset by the absence of project revenues previously earned for services provided to Visa International and Visa Canada in fiscal 2007. • Volume and support incentives increased primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long term customer contracts in fiscal 2009. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non-recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008. In addition, fiscal 2008 incentives reflect the accounting impacts of: (i) conforming accounting policies upon reorganization; and (ii) the retirement of certain issuer programs in fiscal 2007. We expect volume and support incentive to increase somewhat in fiscal 2010. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. The net asset (liability) of volume and support incentives changed during the year as follows: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 (in millions) Beginning balance at October 1, net asset (liability)(1) $ 130 $ (87 ) Provision Current year provision (1,239 ) (1,167 ) Performance adjustments(2) 41 15 Contractual adjustments(3) (36 ) (9 ) Subtotal volume and support incentives (1,234 ) (1,161 ) Payments 1,136 1,378 Ending balance at September 30, net asset(1) $ 32 $ 130 (1) Balance represents the net of the current and long term asset and current liability portions of volume and support incentives as presented in our consolidated balance sheet. (2) Amount represents downward adjustments in estimated obligations under incentive agreements resulting from management’s refinement of its estimate of projected sales performance as new information becomes available. (3) Amount represents adjustments resulting from amendments to existing contractual terms. 40 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

Operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2009, driven by the absence of the litigation provision in connection with our Discover settlement in fiscal 2008, coupled with lower costs in personnel, marketing and professional fees. Operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 and 2007 comparisons below focus on factors other than the inclusion of acquired regions’ operating expenses in fiscal 2008, which totaled $1.3 billion. This increase was substantially offset by a decrease in litigation provision of $1.2 billion. • Personnel decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced employee incentive-related costs in fiscal 2009. Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2008 reflecting the severance charges previously discussed and stock-based compensation expenses awarded to employees in connection with our IPO. • Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks. In fiscal 2008, expenses increased primarily reflecting higher software maintenance and hardware rental expensed following the outsourcing of certain development functions since fiscal 2007. • Advertising, marketing and promotion decreased in fiscal 2009, despite the launch of our global “More people go with Visa” campaign in fiscal 2009 reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. In fiscal 2008, higher advertising, marketing and promotion spending in connection with the 2008 Beijing Olympics and our Visa Extras reward program were offset by the absence of costs incurred in fiscal 2007 related to certain joint promotional campaigns which did not recur during fiscal 2008. • Visa International fees ceased as a result of the reorganization, as Visa U.S.A. and Visa International both became direct subsidiaries of Visa Inc. • Professional and consulting fees decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in the prior year in connection with our global 41 Table of Contents reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services. Reduced legal fees also contributed to the decline, reflecting the settlement of outstanding litigation with Discover in fiscal 2008. • Depreciation and amortization decreased during fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of depreciation and amortization for technology and facility in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation of $13 million in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. We expect our new east coast data center and office building to generate additional depreciation expense of approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010. • Administrative and other remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. Administrative and other expenses in fiscal 2007 included facilities expense paid to the real estate joint ventures owned by Visa U.S.A. and Visa International, which were consolidated as part of Visa Inc. following the reorganization. • Litigation provision primarily reflected: (i) $1.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2008 in connection with the Discover settlement, (ii) additional accruals of $285 million made in fiscal 2008 related to covered litigation, and (iii) $1.9 billion related to the settlement of outstanding litigation with American Express in fiscal 2007. All of these matters are covered by the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) Visa Inc.2009 Visa Inc.2008 VisaU.S.A.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 2009vs.2008 2008vs.2007 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ — $ 1 $ 40 $ (1 ) $ (39 ) NM (97 )% Interest expense (115 ) (143 ) (81 ) 28 (62 ) (20 )% 77 % Investment income, net 575 211 103 364 108 NM NM Other 2 35 — (33 ) 35 (95 )% NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 462 $ 104 $ 62 $ 358 $ 42 NM 67 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal 2007 reflected the equity in earnings of Visa International which was acquired in the reorganization. • Interest expense decreased in 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The increase in 2008 is primarily due to interest accretion related to the American Express settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. See Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. • Investment income, net increased in 2009 primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $473 million recognized on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, partially offset by lower interest income earned on both our investments in marketable securities and the portion of our IPO proceeds used to redeem our class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares in October 2008. Investment income, net in fiscal 2008 also reflected realized losses and other- 42 Table of Contents than-temporary-impairment of $68 million on investments and money market funds. See Note 6—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. • Other non-operating income in fiscal 2008 reflected the adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe. This liability was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate increased to 41% in fiscal 2009, compared with 40% in fiscal 2008 and 23% for Visa U.S.A. in fiscal 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which increased the overall effective tax rate by approximately 1%. Our Singapore subsidiary began operating under a tax incentive agreement in fiscal 2009, which had an insignificant impact on the fiscal 2009 effective tax rate. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to tax reserves related to litigation, and the combined effect of the loss of certain special deductions in California for which we were eligible prior to our IPO, the change in state tax apportionment, and a one-time benefit attributable to the remeasurement of deferred taxes. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 to decrease to below 40% due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payment of required litigation settlement payments, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high-quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, management believes that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Management will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: 2009 2008 2007(1) (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 558 $ 531 $ 505 Investing activities 1,830 554 (463 ) Financing activities (2,751 ) 3,624 (37 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (5 ) — (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (362 ) $ 4,704 $ 5 43 Table of Contents (1) Historical balances for periods prior to October 1, 2007 represent balances for Visa U.S.A. the accounting acquirer in the business combination. Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non-cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million book gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income of $804 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of $92 million to satisfy payments settlement activities; $115 million of compensation benefit payments net of new accruals; and $217 million of volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. These uses of cash were offset by deferred taxes payable, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items, as well as changes in other operating assets and liabilities. Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects $884 million of cash distribution from the Reserve Primary Fund (the “Fund”), net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008, reflects $1,002 million of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re-invested in shorter-term cash equivalents and $415 million of property, equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 6—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually-required redemption of our class C (series II) and class C (series III) common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation Escrow Account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by funding of covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation Escrow Account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributed to IPO related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C (series I) common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation Escrow Account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the Retrospective Responsibility Plan. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting funding of covered litigation payments from the litigation Escrow Account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long- 44 Table of Contents term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment Portfolio. Our investment portfolio primarily comprises of securities which enable us to meet a desired level of liquidity to meet working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds, debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies and Canadian government debt securities. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Uncertainties in the credit markets have affected a number of these holdings. In September 2008, the Fund was unable to honor our request for the full redemption of our investment totaling $983 million. The Fund was subsequently placed into liquidation and announced that it would distribute funds to investors on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the number of shares held by each investor. Since the announcement, we have received distributions totaling $903 million, including $19 million received in October of fiscal 2010. We believe that the fund will distribute its remaining assets within twelve months, and have therefore classified our remaining investment of $69 million, which reflects an impairment of $29 million, as a current asset at September 30, 2009. See Note 6—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving Credit Facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain of our class B and class C stockholders and certain of our customers and affiliates of our customers. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There have been no borrowings under this facility. At September 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants with respect to this facility. U.S. Commercial Paper Programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. At September 30, 2009, we had no obligations outstanding under this program. There are no financial covenants related to this program. 45 Table of Contents Universal Shelf Registration Statement. On May 6, 2009 we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. Per the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow Account. We maintain an Escrow Account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the Escrow Account the shares of class B common stock held by our shareholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2009 was $1.7 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet ($1.4 billion in current assets and $350 million in long-term assets). As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2009, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s rated our unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’s Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long-term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short-term unsecured debt A-1 Stable P-1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including, changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments Settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring customers represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered Litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As part of the Plan, we deposited $3.0 billion of our IPO proceeds into an Escrow Account from which settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation will be paid. During fiscal 2009, we deposited an additional $1.8 billion into the Escrow Account. Under the Plan, when the Company funds the Escrow Account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to the shares of class A common stock. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial 46 Table of Contents statements. In fiscal 2009 we made $2.0 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the Escrow Account. Other Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our retailers’ litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement (the “Prepayment Agreement”) to modify our remaining payment obligations under the original retailers’ litigation settlement agreement. Pursuant to the Prepayment Agreement, on October 5, 2009 we made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation. Redemption of Stock. In fiscal 2008, we redeemed 154,738,487 shares of class B common stock for $6.6 billion and 159,657,751 shares of our class C (series I) common stock for $6.8 billion. In fiscal 2009 we completed the redemption of 79,748,857 shares of our class C (series II) common stock and 35,263,585 shares of our class C (series III) common stock held by Visa Europe for $2.6 billion, less dividends and certain other adjustments. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. The authorization will be in place through September 30, 2010 and is subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Dividends. During fiscal 2009, we paid $318 million in dividends. On October 20, 2009, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.125 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $93 million in connection with this dividend in December 2009. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the dividend declarations. We intend to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors, at an annual rate equal to $0.50 per share of class A common stock. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe Put Option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.’s forward price-to-earnings multiple (the “P/E ratio”) at the time the option is exercised (as defined in the option agreement) to Visa Europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12-month period (“adjusted sustainable income”). Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income is calculated under the terms of the put option agreement and includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. At September 30, 2009, the fair value of the put option liability was $346 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as determined at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted 47 Table of Contents sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below for illustrative purposes only is based on Visa Europe’s financial results for the year ended September 30, 2008. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2008 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2009, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 22.0 and the P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 4.5x as compared to the estimated long term differential of 5.3x we used to value the put option. However these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were to be exercised at any point in the future. Visa Inc’s Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Projected Sustainable Net Operating Income of $75 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Sustainable Net Income Above/Below $75 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $1,875 $625 20 $1,500 $500 15 $1,125 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and employees’ final three to five years of earnings, as well as a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and for Visa U.S.A. in fiscal 2007, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $170 million, $190 million and $65 million, respectively. In fiscal 2010, we intend to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $70 million. Capital Expenditures. During fiscal 2009, we completed the construction of a new data center on the east coast of the United States. Upon completion in March 2009, we migrated our current east coast data center to this new facility. The new data center is intended to support our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 we incurred total costs of $156 million, $241 million and $23 million, respectively related to the construction of this new data center. We will continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure, some of which we treat as capital expenditures. Other Uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2009, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $56 million. 48 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2009, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.3 billion of assets, of which $34 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. Marketable debt instruments in this category include corporate debt securities, mortgage backed securities, other asset backed securities and auction rate securities. See Note 5—Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20-year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by the EU region and Visa CEMEA. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa International’s guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2009. We indemnify customers for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, traveler’s cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require customers to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institution and other customers under which we may agree to indemnify the customer for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2009. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and 49 Table of Contents available credit facilities. See Note 3—Visa Europe, Note 10—Debt, Note 18—Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents non-cancelable agreements with financial institutions and merchants for various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from less than one year to eight years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. (5) Included dividend amount of $93 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2009 and will be paid on December 1, 2009 to all holders of record of Visa’s common stock as of November 16, 2009. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $397 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2009, we also accrued $22 million of interest and $5 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa’s obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $346 million at September 30, 2009 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visa’s obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 3—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Volume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution customers, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria includes the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our customers. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our customers’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, and as a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2009, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The purchase price of the Visa Europe shares under the put option is based upon a formula that, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.’s forward price-to-earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income for the forward 12-month period. See Note 3—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe’s option, which under certain conditions could obligate us to purchase its members’ equity interests for an amount greater than fair value, was determined to be 51 Table of Contents approximately $346 million at September 30, 2009. While the put option is in fact non transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction. Our valuation methodology involves using probability weighted models designed to estimate the present value of our liability assuming various possible exercise decisions that Visa Europe could make, including the possibility it will never exercise its option, under different economic conditions in the future. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option, and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise—Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe’s stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe’s largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential—The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over both the shorter of the preceding 24 months or since our IPO (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long-term value of the Company or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market’s expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe’s projected sustainable adjusted net operating income. 52 Table of Contents The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe’s current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe’s results from euros to U.S. dollars reflects our estimate of long-term exchange rates and is determined based on forward foreign exchange rates available in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. The put option became exercisable during fiscal 2009. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2009. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value—Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our brand and customer relationships intangible assets have indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to one reporting unit, which is the level in which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. Review of impairment is completed annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Impairment testing for intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or asset group and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value is less than the carrying value. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two-step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that 53 Table of Contents goodwill. Management relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. No impairment of our intangible assets or goodwill exists as of our July 1, 2009 annual assessment, and no events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization among other factors. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets was $21.1 billion, including $10.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at September 30, 2009. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding to which we are a party. We record a liability for claims and legal proceedings when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns, and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. 54 Table of Contents Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended FASB ASC 260-10 to address whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two-class method. The amendment requires companies to treat unvested share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share. We will adopt this amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. This change will not result in any impact to fiscal 2009 and 2008 full year diluted class A net income per share. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis, and cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are related primarily to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues that are derived from foreign currency-denominated transactions, and to adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for costs and expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedges exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In fiscal 2009, we implemented a rolling hedge strategy program, which we anticipate utilizing going forward. Under this strategy, we seek to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $742 million and $4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008. The aggregate notional amount of $742 million outstanding at September 30, 2009 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of $61 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2009. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with customers relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 55 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were $176 million and $403 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $3 million at September 30, 2009. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $34 million and $103 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in rates would have impacted the fair value of these notes by approximately $2 million at September 30, 2009. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2009. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2009, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 5.3x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $44 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $71 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Assets Risk Our total defined benefit pension plan assets were $703 million and $624 million at September 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although these assets are not included in our financial statements, a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets could result in increases to our pension liability and a reduction to stockholders’ equity due to an increase in the underfunded status of the plan, increases in pension expense due to a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets, and increases in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2010, which we expect to make in September 2010.

1403161,V,VISA INC.,2010,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of cash and checks. We provide financial institutions with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. We continue to monitor the progress of the global economic recovery, which has shown signs of slow but gradual improvement. We expect consumer and commercial spending, and our payments volume to continue to increase in the near term if the economic recovery maintains momentum. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in the U.S. in July 2010 includes provisions that will establish regulation and oversight of debit interchange rates and certain other network industry practices in the U.S. While the legislation does not directly regulate the network fees we charge, except to ensure that fees are not used to evade the new regulation of interchange rates, it may give retailers greater ability to route debit transactions onto competitive networks, which can reduce the processing fees we currently earn on debit transactions. Because the implementation details for this new legislation will be determined over the next year, the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements is unknown at this time. However, we expect to see the impacts of the legislation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Other regulatory measures previously enacted in the U.S. became effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These regulatory measures primarily impacted our clients, but have not resulted in any notable impact to our payments volumes. We continue to believe that our broad platform of payment products provides substantial value to both retailers and consumers, and that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency, will buffer the impacts of our current regulatory environment, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, and in particular payments volume growth outside the U.S. Funding of the litigation escrow account. During May 2010 and subsequently in October 2010, after our fiscal year end, we deposited $500 million and $800 million, respectively, into the escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan, or the plan. Under the terms of the plan, when Visa funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock retained by our 41 Table of Contents U.S. clients and their affiliates are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. On an as-converted basis, funding of the escrow account had the effect of our repurchasing approximately 7 million shares and 11 million shares of class A common stock, respectively. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Share repurchase plan. In October 2009, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase plan. As of September 30, 2010, we have drawn on the entire $1.0 billion authorized amount by repurchasing a total of 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock at an average price of $77.48 per share. In October 2010, subsequent to our fiscal year end, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan, which will be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. Expansion of our eCommerce capabilities. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation, a leading provider of electronic payment, risk management and payment security solutions to online merchants, at a price of $26.00 per share. The total purchase consideration was approximately $2.0 billion, paid with cash on hand. The acquisition of CyberSource will expand our online payment, fraud and security management capabilities and is expected to accelerate our growth in the eCommerce category. The results of CyberSource are included in our results from the acquisition date. See Note 6—CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. We believe that payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. The growth in nominal payments volume in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, in particular credit and debit, was primarily driven by growth outside the U.S. Comparing fiscal 2009 with fiscal 2008, nominal payments volume declined in credit and commercial products, which was offset by growth in debit resulting in minimal year-over-year nominal payments volume impact. The number of processed transactions continues to increase reflecting the continued shift to electronic payments globally. The payments volume and processed transactions tables presented below do not include CyberSource volumes and transactions. CyberSource activities primarily contribute to our data processing revenues, which is discussed below in Results of Operations. 42 Table of Contents This table sets forth nominal product payments volumes for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1): U.S.A.

Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2010, September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 were based on payments volume reported by our clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2010, June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. 43 Table of Contents This table sets forth transaction volumes processed by our VisaNet system during the following fiscal periods: 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009% Change 2009 vs. 2008% Change (in millions) Total processed transactions 45,411 39,885 36,956 14 % 8 % Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are primarily based on information we accumulate from VisaNet, our secure, centralized, global processing platform, which provides transaction processing services linking issuers and acquirers. Data processing revenues also include revenues earned for transactions processed by CyberSource’s online payment gateway. International transaction revenues are assessed to clients on transactions where the cardholder’s issuer country is different from the merchant’s country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments volume, which includes single currency transactions, and currency conversion activities for transactions involving more than one currency. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement and fees from cardholder services and licensing and certification. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Volume and support incentives represent contracts with clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, stock-based compensation, incentives, fringe benefits and contractor expense. 44 Table of Contents Network, EDP and communications primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Advertising, marketing and promotion includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional and consulting fees consists of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of the incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, and the incremental basis in technology and other assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource. The incremental basis in technology and other assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization was fully depreciated and amortized at September 30, 2010. Administrative and other primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes cash dividends received from other cost method investments. Other non-operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Also included in this amount is the change in the fair value of the liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was fully discharged in October 2008. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) U.S. operating revenues $ 4,718 $ 4,023 $ 3,664 $ 695 $ 359 17 % 10 % Rest of world operating revenues 3,137 2,669 2,378 468 291 18 % 12 % Visa Europe operating revenues 210 219 221 (9 ) (2 ) (4 )% (1 )% Total Operating Revenues $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 1,154 $ 648 17 % 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. 45 Table of Contents Growth in operating revenues primarily reflects an increase in nominal payments volume, continued growth of processed transactions and the impact of pricing modifications made on various services as a result of innovations in our product line and improvements in our service model. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to volume and support incentives. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as part of the overall global economic recovery, and evaluate the potential impacts to operating revenues under our current regulatory environment. We may adjust our pricing strategy to ensure that it competitively aligns with the value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Revenues from processing cross-border transactions for our clients fluctuate with cross-border travel and the extent to which Visa-branded products are utilized for travel purposes. Cross-border transactions have shown signs of improvement in all geographies during fiscal 2010. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 1% increase in total operating revenues. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. As we are substantially hedged through fiscal 2011, we do not expect any significant impact from currency fluctuations next year. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,497 $ 3,174 $ 3,061 $ 323 $ 113 10 % 4 % Data processing revenues 3,125 2,430 2,073 695 357 29 % 17 % International transaction revenues 2,290 1,916 1,721 374 195 20 % 11 % Other revenues 713 625 569 88 56 14 % 10 % Volume and support incentives (1,560 ) (1,234 ) (1,161 ) (326 ) (73 ) 26 % 6 % Total Operating Revenues $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 6,263 $ 1,154 $ 648 17 % 10 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. • Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. We expect service revenues to increase in fiscal 2011 as we continue to align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to strategic pricing modifications implemented in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with modest growth of 1% in nominal global payments volume. • Data processing revenues increased during fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Data processing 46 Table of Contents revenues also benefitted slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. We do not believe that the current rate of growth in data processing revenues is representative of sustainable future revenue growth due to the inclusion of these pricing actions, which have largely anniversaried in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. However, we will benefit from the inclusion of a full year CyberSource activity in fiscal 2011. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2009 due to 8% growth in the number of transactions processed during the year, combined with other strategic pricing modifications. • International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross-border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. We generally expect international transaction revenue to grow in line with increased cross-border transaction volume, although economic downturns or other adverse international conditions could hinder this growth. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2009 despite an 11% decline in cross-border nominal payments volume, primarily due to strategic pricing modifications made after fiscal 2008. • Other revenues increased during fiscal 2010, primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. We entered into this licensing arrangement with VisaNet do Brasil following its initial public offering and the sale of our equity interest in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The increase also reflects growth in other new license and royalty fees. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to growth in the Visa Extras loyalty platform for administrative and rewards fulfillment services performed in support of the platform. • Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one-time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. As anticipated, volume and support incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 16% in fiscal 2010. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.0% to 16.5% for the full 2011 fiscal year. The actual amount of volume and support incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or new contracts. Volume and support incentives increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to incentives incurred on initiation or early renewal of significant long-term customer contracts. These incentives were partially offset by the absence of a non-recurring charge related to a customer agreement executed in fiscal 2008. 47 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,222 $ 1,228 $ 1,314 $ (6 ) $ (86 ) (1 )% (7 )% Network, EDP and communications 425 393 339 32 54 8 % 16 % Advertising, marketing and promotion 964 918 1,016 46 (98 ) 5 % (10 )% Professional and consulting fees 286 268 323 18 (55 ) 7 % (17 )% Depreciation and amortization 265 226 237 39 (11 ) 17 % (5 )% Administrative and other 359 338 332 21 6 7 % 2 % Litigation provision (45 ) 2 1,470 (47 ) (1,468 ) NM NM Total Operating Expenses $ 3,476 $ 3,373 $ 5,031 $ 103 $ (1,658 ) 3 % (33 )% (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. • Personnel decreased in fiscal 2010, reflecting lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 12 – Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of larger severance and other charges incurred in fiscal 2008 associated with workforce consolidation and elimination of overlapping functions, combined with reduced contractor fees and employee incentive-related costs in fiscal 2009. • Network, EDP and communications increased in fiscal 2010 and 2009, reflecting higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks. • Advertising, marketing and promotion increased in fiscal 2010, due to higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which will not recur in fiscal 2011. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. We continue to review and refine our marketing and advertising spending globally to ensure it is consistent with our growth initiatives. In fiscal 2009, expenses decreased, despite the launch of our global “More people go with Visa” campaign, reflecting the effective implementation of our global strategy to reduce cost. • Professional and consulting fees increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects the absence of consulting and legal fees incurred in fiscal 2008 in connection with our global reorganization and IPO, and related insourcing of professional services. 48 Table of Contents • Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition. The increase also reflects charges related to the new east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. We expect associated depreciation and amortization related to CyberSource assets to increase in fiscal 2011, reflecting a full year of charges, or $76 million. This increase will be offset by the absence of $68 million in annual depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis of assets acquired in our October 2007 reorganization, as those assets became fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of depreciation and amortization for assets in our Colorado data center which were fully depreciated in fiscal 2008, partially offset by additional depreciation in fiscal 2009 from our new east coast data center. • Administrative and other increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Administrative and other expenses remained flat in fiscal 2009, primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses recorded upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies, offset by a decrease in overall spending reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. • Litigation provision in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the $41 million pre-tax gain recorded as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers’ litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. The remaining credit balance was due to the release of accruals during fiscal 2010 for certain legal matters. There was no other significant provision activity to offset the credit balance during fiscal 2010. The decrease in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the absence of litigation provision recorded in connection with the Discover settlement in fiscal 2008. See Note 22—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2010 2009 2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 2010vs.2009 2009vs.2008 (in millions, except percentages) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates $ (7 ) $ — $ 1 $ (7 ) $ (1 ) NM NM Interest expense (72 ) (115 ) (143 ) 43 28 (37 )% (20 )% Investment income, net 49 575 211 (526 ) 364 (92 )% NM Other 79 2 35 77 (33 ) NM (95 )% Total Other Income (Expense) $ 49 $ 462 $ 104 $ (413 ) $ 358 (90 )% NM (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. • Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2010 and 2009 reflecting lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. 49 Table of Contents • Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre-tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances, reflecting the use of $1.0 billion to repurchase class A common stock under the share repurchase plan, $682 million to prepay the Retailers’ litigation and $500 million to fund the litigation escrow account under the retrospective responsibility plan. The increase in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the pre-tax gain of $473 million discussed above, partially offset by lower interest income earned from lower investment balances after funding our October 2008 stock redemptions. • Other non-operating income in fiscal 2010 reflects a non-cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax. The change in value does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 3 – Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Other non-operating income in fiscal 2008 reflects adjustments to the fair market value of our liability under the Framework Agreement with Visa Europe, which was settled during the first fiscal quarter of 2009. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rate decreased to 36% in fiscal 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009 and 40% in fiscal 2008. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2010, and the additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. The increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to additional foreign tax in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends, to repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors, to service the payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high-quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 50 Table of Contents Cash Flow Data This table summarizes cash flow activity for the following fiscal years: 2010 2009 2008 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,691 $ 558 $ 531 Investing activities (1,904 ) 1,830 554 Financing activities (1,542 ) (2,751 ) 3,624 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5 1 (5 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (750 ) $ (362 ) $ 4,704 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income including non-controlling interest of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for volume and support incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers’ litigation obligation, as further discussed below. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year-to-date net income and lower litigation settlement payments. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will sufficiently meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income including non-controlling interest of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non-cash adjustments for volume and support incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and volume and support incentives. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 consisted of net income including non-controlling interest of $804 million and adjustments for non-cash items of $3.1 billion. Cash provided by operating activities was lower than income provided by operations, reflecting the use of cash to satisfy litigation settlement payments and volume and support incentive payments net of new accruals. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities compared to $290 million in the prior year, both of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund, in the current year compared to $884 million of distributions in the prior year as the Fund liquidated. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to construction of our east coast data center. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2008 reflects $1.0 billion of cash acquired through the reorganization, $949 million of net cash proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities that were re-invested in shorter-term cash equivalents and $415 million of property, 51 Table of Contents equipment and technology purchases primarily related to construction of our data center. In addition, we reclassified our $953 million investment in the Fund from cash equivalents to other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under Sources of Liquidity, below, and Note 7—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, funding of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and $368 million of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually-required redemption of certain of our series class C common shares for $2.6 billion, funding of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2008 is attributable to IPO-related activities including $19.1 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of class A common stock, offset by $13.4 billion used for the partial redemption of class B and class C common stock, and $3.0 billion payment to the litigation escrow account for the covered litigation matters in accordance with the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, there was a source of cash of $1.1 billion, reflecting covered litigation payments from the litigation escrow account, offset by $93 million and $22 million for dividend and routine debt payments, respectively. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, an investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based 52 Table of Contents on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2010. U.S. commercial paper programs. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2010. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2010 was $1.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, we deposited an additional $800 million into the escrow account. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, we have not included them as part of our liquid assets. However, they should be viewed as a source of cash for purposes of making payments related to settlement of or judgment in covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2010, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s rated our unsecured debt as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’s Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Long-term unsecured debt Local A+ Stable A1 Stable Foreign A+ Stable A1 Stable Short-term unsecured debt A-1 Stable P-1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 53 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement, arising primarily from settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance. These settlement receivables and payables generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with standard market conventions for domestic transactions and foreign currency transactions. We maintain a liquidity position sufficient to enable uninterrupted daily net settlement. Typically, the highest seasonal liquidity demand is experienced in December and early January during the holiday shopping season. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 22—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Sources of Liquidity. In fiscal 2010, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. For example, in connection with our Retailers’ litigation settlement in fiscal 2003, we were required to make annual settlement payments of $200 million through fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2009, we entered into an agreement to prepay our remaining payment obligations under the original Retailers’ litigation settlement agreement. We made a payment of $682 million to fully satisfy the remaining $800 million obligation in October 2009. Share repurchase plan. During fiscal 2010, we used $1.0 billion to repurchase approximately 12.9 million shares of our class A common stock under the share repurchase plan authorized in October 2009. In October 2010, after the end of our 2010 fiscal year, our board of directors authorized a second $1.0 billion share repurchase plan to be in place through September 30, 2011, subject to extension or expansion at the determination of our board of directors. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. Dividends. During fiscal 2010, we paid $368 million in dividends. On October 20, 2010, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.15 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $107 million in connection with this dividend in December 2010. See Note 16—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate continuing to pay quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.’s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. 54 Table of Contents At September 30, 2010, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $267 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $75 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $75 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below, for illustrative purposes only, is based on Visa Europe’s forecasted financial results for the year ended September 30, 2010. However, this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2010 or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $75 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2010, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 18.8 and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 3.5. At September 30, 2010, the spot P/E ratio was 15.7 and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.6. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. Visa Inc’s Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $75 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $25 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $75 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $1,875 $625 20 $1,500 $500 15 $1,125 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees will accrue benefits under the cash balance formula and will cease to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan which provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are 55 Table of Contents funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $66 million, $170 million and $190 million, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate to fund our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $60 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2010 reflecting the completion of our new east coast data center in fiscal 2009. The new data center supports our technology objectives related to reliability, scalability, security and new product development. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million to $275 million in fiscal 2011, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. Acquisition of CyberSource. On July 21, 2010, we completed our acquisition of CyberSource Corporation for approximately $2.0 billion in cash, or $1.8 billion net of cash received. The combination is expected to accelerate the growth of our eCommerce category and enhance the value of our network, product and service offerings to financial institutions, merchants, partners and consumers. See Note 6—CyberSource Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements. Other uses. In addition to the principal uses of liquidity described above, we are also required to make interest and principal payments under our outstanding indebtedness. Our total outstanding principal balance of debt at September 30, 2010, net of unamortized issuance costs, was $44 million. Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2010, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $5.7 billion of assets, of which $13 million, or less than 1%, had significant unobservable inputs. For these instruments, we lacked observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. At September, 30, 2010, debt instruments in this category included auction rate securities. See Note 5—Investments and Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements primarily comprise guarantees. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20-year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe and what is now the headquarters for our Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa operations. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa International’s guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2010. 56 Table of Contents We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, traveler’s cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is unlimited. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. See Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2010. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 3—Visa Europe, Note 11—Debt, Note 12—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 22—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases. Visa leases certain premises, equipment and software licenses under leases with varying expiration dates. (3) Represents future cash payments for volume and support incentive agreements with financial institutions and merchants under various programs designed to build sales volume and increase payment product acceptance. These agreements, which range in term from one to thirteen years, provide card issuance, marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 19—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three years to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help us increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain 57 Table of Contents advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes dividend amount of $107 million as dividends were declared on October 20, 2010 and will be paid on December 7, 2010 to all holders of record of Visa’s common stock as of November 19, 2010. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $443 million, net of offsetting tax benefits associated with the corresponding effects of state and foreign income taxes. At September 30, 2010, we also accrued $58 million of interest and $10 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa’s obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $267 million at September 30, 2010 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visa’s obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 3—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 12—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Volume and Support Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with clients, merchants and other business partners to build payments volume and to increase product acceptance. These incentives are generally accounted for as reductions of operating revenue or expense where an identifiable benefit can be identified. Certain volume and support incentives are based on performance targets and are accrued systematically and rationally based upon estimates of future performance. Other incentives are based 58 Table of Contents on fixed payments and are generally deferred, if certain criteria are met. The deferability criteria include the existence of future benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of the deferred amounts. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the period of contractual recoverability. Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of volume and support incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, estimates of card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, volume and support incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2010, performance adjustments to volume and support agreements were less than 1% of our total operating revenues. Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option under which, if exercised, we are required to purchase all of the share capital of Visa Europe from its members at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.’s forward price-to-earnings multiple, as defined in the agreement, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between the Company and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 3—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe’s option was estimated to be approximately $267 million at September 30, 2010. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the put option in an orderly transaction at the measurement date. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the Put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arm’s length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. 59 Table of Contents Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a standalone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise—Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its articles of association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe’s stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe’s largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential—The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in long-term value of the Company or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates therefore are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market’s expectations of the future earnings of Visa Inc. and the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe’s current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe’s results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled 60 Table of Contents scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2010. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value—Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management’s judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring CyberSource in July 2010, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years. See Note 6—CyberSource Acquisition and Note 9 – Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets. Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of July 1, 2010, we evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is 61 Table of Contents measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite-lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2010. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two-step process that involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value and comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on July 1, 2010, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we completed the CyberSource acquisition on July 21, 2010, which resulted in an additional $1.2 billion in goodwill and established a second reporting unit. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. Of the $1.2 billion, approximately $0.8 billion was allocated to the second reporting unit. The remainder was allocated to our original reporting unit to reflect the incremental growth and synergy this acquisition will provide to our existing business. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exist as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.4 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $595 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2010. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2010. See Note 4—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 22—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 62 Table of Contents Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 22—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the immediately following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $627 million and $742 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $627 million outstanding at September 30, 2010 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $55 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2010. See Note 14—Derivatives Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. 63 Table of Contents We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $135 million and $176 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2010. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $13 million and $34 million at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also have fixed rate debt which is subject to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have impacted the fair value of the debt by approximately $1 million at September 30, 2010. Visa Europe Put Option We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2010. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2010, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 3.5x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $33 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $81 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan Risks Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $766 million and $703 million and projected benefit obligations were $743 million and $739 million at September 30, 2010 and September 30, 2009, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2011, which we expect to make in September 2011.

1403161,V,VISA INC.,2011,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, banks and governments around the world, enabling them to use digital currency instead of checks and cash. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services to benefit our existing clients and to position Visa to serve more and different constituencies. Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the year ended September 30, 2011, reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. The Reform Act. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Reform Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide fees charged previously. The Federal Reserve has also promulgated regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant’s ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. We expect the interchange and exclusivity regulations, as well as the routing regulations, to have an adverse impact on our pricing, reduce the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process, and decrease associated revenues. A number of our clients may seek fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit cards they issue and reduce investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some may impose new or higher fees on debit cards or demand deposit account relationships. Some may elect to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. We expect many merchants to use the routing regulations to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year, and the pace of our U.S. revenue growth to begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Because we may have to re-examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations, these and other clients will have the opportunity to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers’ debit cards. We believe that we will be able to mitigate the negative impacts from the Reform Act to some extent through pricing modifications, and working with our clients and other business partners to win 41 Table of Contents merchant preference to route transactions over our network. Our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency may help buffer the impacts of the Reform Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Reform Act while mitigating some of the negative impacts the Reform Act would have on our current business models. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and to compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment. Share repurchases. We effectively repurchased 43.0 million shares at an average price of $74.94 per share, for a total cost of $3.2 billion during the year ended September 30, 2011. Of the $3.2 billion, $2.0 billion was executed through the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market, and $1.2 billion was effectively executed through deposits into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. Adjusted Financial Results. During the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we recorded a decrease of $122 million and $79 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating other income in our financial results. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. The following table presents our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2011 and 2010 excluding the impact of this revaluation. Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2011 Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, 2010 (in millions, except per share data) Net income attributable to Visa Inc. (as reported) $ 3,650 $ 2,966 Revaluation of Visa Europe put option (122 ) (79 ) Adjusted net income attributable to Visa Inc. $ 3,528 $ 2,887 Weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding (as reported) 707 739 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 4.99 $ 3.91 Diluted earnings per share (as reported) $ 5.16 $ 4.01 Impact of the revaluation of Visa Europe put option $ 0.17 $ 0.10 We believe the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period. The reduction in the fair value of the put option in each fiscal year was primarily the result of declines in our estimated long-term price-to-earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and does not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. We therefore believe that the resulting non-operating income recorded is not indicative of Visa’s performance in these years or future periods. Fundamo acquisition. On June 9, 2011, we acquired Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in developing economies, for $110 million. The acquisition was made to accelerate the execution of Visa’s global strategy to provide the next generation of payments solutions and to provide long-term growth opportunities to connect unbanked or under-banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. The Fundamo acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.02 for the full 2011 fiscal year. See Note 5—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. PlaySpan acquisition. On March 1, 2011, we acquired PlaySpan, a privately held company whose payments platform processes transactions for digital goods in online games, digital media and social 42 Table of Contents networks around the world, for total potential purchase consideration of up to $225 million. The acquisition of PlaySpan extends Visa’s capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce in order to expand the scope of payment services available to clients and consumers. See Note 5—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The PlaySpan acquisition had a dilutive impact to earnings per share of $0.03 for the full 2011 fiscal year. Sale of investment in Companhia Brasileira de Soluções e Serviços (“CBSS”). On January 24, 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Visa International, sold its 10 percent stake in Visa Vale issuer CBSS to Banco do Brasil and Banco Bradesco. CBSS continues to issue Visa Vale prepaid cards in Brazil, and Visa expects no disruption to cardholder service as a result of this transaction. Visa’s gross proceeds from the sale were $103 million. After receiving regulatory approval during the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $85 million in the investment income, net line on our consolidated statements of operations. The amount of the gain net of tax was $44 million. See Note 6—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume and processed transactions are key drivers of our business. Payments volume is the basis for service revenues and processed transactions are the basis for data processing revenues. We have maintained double digit growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions for the past two years. The increase in payments volume and processed transactions reflects the continuing worldwide shift to digital currency. The following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1).

Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. 43 Table of Contents (2) Includes prepaid volume. (3) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. (4) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported with respect to the twelve months ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

(4) Includes CyberSource transactions prior to the July 2010 acquisition. Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our VisaNet system. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest and fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues are primarily earned from clients for their participation in card programs carrying marks of the Visa brand. Service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues include revenues earned for transactions processed by VisaNet, our secure, centralized global processing platform, CyberSource’s online payment gateway and PlaySpan’s virtual goods payment platform. 44 Table of Contents International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments and cash volume and currency conversion activities. Cross-border volumes involve transactions where the cardholder’s issuer country is different from the merchant’s country and includes both single and multi-currency transactions. Other revenues consist primarily of revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and activities related to our recently acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our electronic payments network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expenses of properties and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount are depreciation and amortization of acquired in technology and other assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, obtained in our July 2010 acquisition of CyberSource, March 2011 acquisition of PlaySpan and June 2011 acquisition of Fundamo. General and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate and overhead expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense primarily includes accretion associated with litigation settlements to be paid over periods longer than one year and interest incurred on outstanding debt as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Investment income, net represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other cost method investments. 45 Table of Contents Other non-operating income primarily relates to the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued double digit growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border payments volume. Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services, as well as the inclusion of activity from newly acquired entities. The benefits of pricing modifications are partially offset by increases to client incentives as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Reform Act. The new U.S. debit regulations will likely moderate the pace of our operating revenue growth in the U.S., primarily within service and data processing revenues, through fiscal 2012. We expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full 2012 fiscal year. We further expect that the pace of our U.S. revenue growth will begin regaining momentum in fiscal 2013. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local or regional currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The general weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was moderated by our hedging activities, resulting in a net 2% and 1% increase, respectively, in total operating revenues compared to the same prior year periods. In comparison, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2009, net against the impact from our hedging activities, resulted in a 3% decline in total operating revenues. We do not expect a significant impact from currency fluctuations during the 2012 fiscal year, as the effect of exchange rate movements is minimized through our hedging program. 46 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2011 2010 2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 4,261 $ 3,497 $ 3,174 $ 764 $ 323 22 % 10 % Data processing revenues 3,478 3,125 2,430 353 695 11 % 29 % International transaction revenues 2,674 2,290 1,916 384 374 17 % 20 % Other revenues 655 713 625 (58 ) 88 (8 )% 14 % Client incentives (1,880 ) (1,560 ) (1,234 ) (320 ) (326 ) 21 % 26 % Total Operating Revenues $ 9,188 $ 8,065 $ 6,911 $ 1,123 $ 1,154 14 % 17 % (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. • Service revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 16% growth in nominal payments volume. Service revenues also benefited from competitive pricing actions which became effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We continue to monitor the progress of nominal payments volume growth as we align our pricing strategy across the globe to ensure it reflects the competitive value and growth opportunities provided to our clients. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to 13% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in the geographic mix of our service revenues and the impact of our hedging program against the weakening U.S. dollar. • Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 12% of growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource, which we acquired in July 2010. As anticipated, this growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and a previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions. Beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2011, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year, associated with the pass-through of non-Visa network transactions, did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2010 due to competitive pricing actions across various geographies which became effective in the second half of fiscal 2009, combined with growth of 14% in the number of transactions processed. Fiscal 2010 data processing revenues also benefited slightly from the inclusion of CyberSource activity since the July acquisition. • International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting growth of 18% in nominal cross-border payments volume. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to a growth of 16% in nominal cross-border payments volume, combined with strategic pricing modifications which took place after the third quarter of fiscal 2009. • Other revenues decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third-party service provider. As a result, revenues and 47 Table of Contents offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in the prior fiscal year associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc. as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decrease was partially offset by increases in licensing fees and the inclusion of revenue attributable to CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to license fees from Cielo, formerly known as Companhia Brasileira de Meios de Pagamento, or VisaNet do Brasil, for the use of Visa trademarks and technology intellectual property. The increase also reflected growth in other license and royalty fees. • Client incentives increased in fiscal 2011 reflecting growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011. Beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the new U.S. debit regulations triggered renegotiations with some of our existing issuing clients and resulted in new contracts with dozens of merchants and some acquirers to win transaction routing preference. As part of our business strategy, we will continue to initiate or renew contracts with merchants and acquirers, which will likely impact our fiscal 2012 results. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17% to 18% for the full 2012 fiscal year. The actual amount of client incentives will vary based on modifications to performance expectations for these contracts, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Client incentives increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to growth in global payments volumes and incentives incurred on significant long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in fiscal 2010. These increases were offset by lower one-time incentives incurred for early renewals compared to fiscal 2009. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

These acquisitions, combined with other increases in headcount throughout the organization, reflect our strategy to invest for future growth. The decrease in fiscal 2010 reflects lower severance charges and reductions in our net periodic pension cost due to the remeasurement and annual census update of our U.S. pension plan. See Note 11—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease was offset by additional salary and stock compensation expense as a result of our acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010. • Network and processing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced change in the presentation of revenue and operating expense associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions. Beginning October 2010, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. As such, $140 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with the pass-through of non-Visa network transactions did not recur. This change does not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset; however, this change in presentation resulted in a reported decline in network and processing throughout fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior year. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher fees paid for debit processing services related to processing transactions through non-Visa networks. • Marketing decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the previously announced changes in contractual arrangements that transitioned the direct billing and administration of the Visa Extras rewards platform from Visa to a third-party service provider. As a result, revenues and offsetting costs associated with these transactions are reported on a net basis and therefore do not appear in our financial results. Further, a large issuer converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The combined impacts resulted in $89 million of revenues and related expenses recorded in fiscal 2010 associated with Visa Extras that did not recur. These changes do not impact operating income or net income attributable to Visa Inc., as revenue and expense amounts completely offset. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2012, which is reflective of incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies, our new product initiatives, recent acquisitions, as well as some modest incremental spend associated with our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The increase in fiscal 2010 reflects higher spending in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The increase also reflects additional investment in emerging markets and higher redemption costs associated with the Visa Extras loyalty platform. • Professional fees increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting investment in technology projects to support our strategy for future growth, The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects professional fees associated with our acquisition of CyberSource and consulting fees related to the migration of one of our product platforms to a new service provider. The increase was offset by the absence of legal fees related to the settlement of Discover financial services and various other litigation matters in fiscal 2009. • Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation 49 Table of Contents and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. The increase in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects additional depreciation and amortization on technology and intangible assets acquired in the CyberSource acquisition, as well as charges related to the east coast data center and office building that were placed in service during the second half of fiscal 2009. • General and administrative increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, general and administration expenses increased primarily due to travel activities related to the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. • Litigation provision increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the absence of the $41 million pre-tax gain recorded in fiscal 2010 as a result of prepaying the remaining obligation under the Retailers’ litigation settlement. The gain reflects the difference between our prepayment amount of $682 million and the carrying value of the obligation. There were no other significant litigation provisions made during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. See Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2011 2010 2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 2011vs.2010 2010vs.2009 (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (32 ) $ (72 ) $ (115 ) $ 40 $ 43 (55 )% (37 )% Investment income, net 108 49 575 59 (526 ) NM (92 )% Other 124 72 2 52 70 73 % NM Total Other Income (Expense) $ 200 $ 49 $ 462 $ 151 $ (413 ) NM (90 )% (1) Percentage change calculated based on whole numbers, not rounded numbers. • Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the reversal of prior years’ accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. The decrease in fiscal 2011 also reflects lower interest accretion from declining litigation balances. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was partially offset by increases related to uncertain tax positions recorded in the first half of fiscal 2010. See Note 20—Income Taxes and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. • Investment income, net increased in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the pre-tax gains recognized from our sale of Visa Vale issuer CBSS, partially offset by the absence of the pre-tax gain recognized in fiscal 2010 for our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund. Investment income, net decreased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to the absence of a pre-tax gain of $473 million and the loss of dividend income upon the sale of our ownership interest in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. Additionally, we earned lower interest income in fiscal 2010 as a result of lower interest rates applicable to our investments and lower investment balances. 50 Table of Contents • Other non-operating income primarily reflects non-cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective tax rates were 36% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, compared with 41% in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were lower than the rate in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the benefit of tax incentives in Singapore, our largest operating hub outside the U.S., beneficial changes in the geographic mix of our global income, the nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option in fiscal 2011 and 2010, and the absence of additional foreign tax related to the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil in fiscal 2009. As a result of anticipated beneficial changes to certain state tax laws beginning in fiscal 2012 and other factors, we expect our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal 2012 to 33% to 34%. This rate excludes any potential related non-cash impact from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios, to ensure payments on required litigation settlements, to ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities, to make planned capital investments in our business, to pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors and to optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that we believe are high-quality and marketable in the short term. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,872 2,691 558 Investing activities (2,299 ) (1,904 ) 1,830 Financing activities (3,304 ) (1,542 ) (2,751 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (9 ) 5 1 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,740 ) $ (750 ) $ (362 ) 51 Table of Contents Operating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher year-to-date net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailer’s litigation obligation in the prior year. Both periods also contain other significant operational payments, including those related to client incentives, settlement transactions, other litigation settlement payments and our annual incentive compensation payments, which were broadly consistent year over year. Although we expect the new U.S. debit regulations to moderate the pace of our growth in operating cash in fiscal 2012, we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2010 primarily reflects net income, including non-controlling interest, of $3.0 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $2.1 billion, offset by payments for client incentives and litigation settlements, primarily including $682 million prepayment of our Retailers’ litigation obligation. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting higher net income and lower litigation settlement payments. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2009 consisted of net income, including non-controlling interest, of $2.4 billion and adjustments for non-cash items of $1.5 billion. Standard non-cash adjustments for client incentive accruals and depreciation and amortization were offset by a $473 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in VisaNet do Brasil, which is reflected in investing activities. Cash from operating activities also reflects the use of $3.3 billion to fund significant operational payments, including litigation and client incentives. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects purchases of $1.9 billion in U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. treasury securities, the acquisition of PlaySpan and Fundamo for $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, and purchases of property, equipment and technology, which were higher compared to the prior year due to ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by the gross proceeds of $103 million from the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer CBSS. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 6—Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the acquisition of CyberSource in July 2010 for $1.8 billion, net of $147 million in cash received. The use of cash in investing activities was partially offset by net cash proceeds of $56 million from sales and maturities of investment securities which were reinvested in money market funds. We also received $89 million in cash distributions from the Reserve Primary Fund, or the Fund. Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the $884 million of cash distribution from the Fund, net cash proceeds of $290 million from the sales and maturities of investment securities and $1.0 billion from the sale of our 10% ownership in VisaNet do Brasil, all of which were reinvested in money market funds. We also purchased $306 million of property, equipment and technology primarily related to the construction of our East Coast data center. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily reflects $2.0 billion in repurchases of our class A common stock in the open market, deposits of $1.2 billion into the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $423 million. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily reflects $1.0 billion in repurchases of class A common stock in the open market, a deposit of $500 million to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $368 million. 52 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily reflects contractually-required redemption of certain series of our class C common shares for $2.6 billion, deposits of $1.8 billion to the litigation escrow account and dividend payments of $318 million, offset by covered litigation payments totaling $2.0 billion from the litigation escrow account. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. As of September 30, 2011, $2.1 billion of cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investments securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of undistributed earnings of $1.9 billion. However, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S., and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of securities which enable us to meet our working capital needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of liquid securities, including money market funds and debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The liquidity of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Other factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting certain securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, and ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A—Risk Factors—Unprecedented economic events in financial markets around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our clients, merchants and cardholders, resulting in a material and adverse impact on our prospects, growth, profitability, revenue and overall business. Revolving credit facilities. On February 15, 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial 53 Table of Contents covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2011. U.S. commercial paper program. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2011. There are no financial covenants related to this program. Universal shelf registration statement. On May 6, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires on May 5, 2012. Escrow account. We maintain an escrow account for use in the payment of covered litigation matters. When the Company funds the escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2011 was $2.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for use solely for the purpose of making payments related to covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2011, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’s Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1 Stable P-1 Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+ Stable A1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents our most consistent liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as covered litigation. As noted above, settlements 54 Table of Contents of, or judgments in, covered litigation are paid from the escrow account. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements, as well as Sources of Liquidity. During fiscal 2011, we made $280 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the escrow account. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Share repurchase. During fiscal 2011, we used $3.2 billion to effectively repurchase 43.0 million class A common shares on an as-converted basis, including $2.0 billion in open market repurchases and $1.2 billion in deposits into the litigation escrow account. Repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. We have completed the share repurchase programs previously authorized by the board of directors in April 2011 and October 2010. In July 2011, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 20, 2012. At September 30, 2011, the July share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $577 million. On October 26, 2011, we announced that our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program, subject to the same terms of the July authorization. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends. During fiscal 2011, we paid $423 million in dividends. On October 18, 2011, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.22 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $151 million in connection with this dividend in December 2011. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.’s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the “P/E ratio” (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the “adjusted sustainable income” (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably 55 Table of Contents estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2011, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2011, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2011, the spot P/E ratio was 14.9x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. Visa Inc’s ForwardPrice-to-Earnings Ratio Payout AssumingAdjusted SustainableIncome of $100 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payoutfor Each $25 million ofAdjusted Sustainable IncomeAbove/Below $100 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $2,500 $625 20 $2,000 $500 15 $1,500 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. Employees hired before January 1, 2008, earn benefits based on their pay during their last five years of employment. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 earn benefits based on a cash balance formula. Effective January 1, 2011, all employees accrued benefits under the cash balance formula and ceased to accrue benefits under any other formula. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $74 million, $66 million, and $170 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $54 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2011 due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $350 million to $400 million range in fiscal 2012, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology and our payments system infrastructure. 56 Table of Contents Acquisitions. We acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received, on March 1, 2011 and June 9, 2011, respectively. The acquisitions extend our capabilities in digital, eCommerce and mCommerce and provide long-term growth opportunities to connect billions of unbanked or under-banked consumers to each other and to the global economy with a secure, reliable and globally accepted form of payment. See Note 5—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. Other uses. The Company prepaid all of its outstanding debt in September 2011. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements-Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2011, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.4 billion of assets and $176 million of liabilities. Of these securities, $176 million, or less than 3%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million of this amount. At September, 30, 2011, debt instruments in this category included $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. There was no outstanding debt at September 30, 2011. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Guarantees and Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by reason of the failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, traveler’s cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In 2001, Visa International entered into a 20-year lease agreement for premises in London to be occupied by Visa Europe. The lease is assigned to Visa Europe Services, Inc., or VESI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa Europe, with Visa International acting as a guarantor to the landlord as required by the laws of the United Kingdom. In the event of a default by VESI, Visa International is obligated to make base lease payments. VESI has agreed to reimburse Visa International for any liabilities that may arise under Visa International’s guarantee to the landlord. Visa International has not made any payments under this guarantee and the estimated fair value of this guarantee was less than $1 million at September 30, 2011. 57 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation at September 30, 2011. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. See Note 2—Visa Europe, Note 11—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits, Note 18—Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.

(3) Represents future cash payments for client incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase payment product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, execution of new contracts, or amendments to existing contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected future reduction of revenues related to these agreements. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the contract terms. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes dividend amount of $151 million as dividends were declared on October 18, 2011 and will be paid on December 6, 2011 to all holders of record of Visa’s common stock as of November 18, 2011. 58 Table of Contents (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $468 million. At September 30, 2011, we also accrued $65 million of interest and $8 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa’s obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2011 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visa’s obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit can be established. We generally capitalize certain incentive payments under these agreements if certain criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Incentives are accrued systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit. 59 Table of Contents Assumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients’ actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2011, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe’s projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe’s option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2011. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm’s length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. 60 Table of Contents Probability of Exercise-Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe’s stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe’s largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential-The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market’s expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance applied include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe’s adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe’s current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe’s results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have 61 Table of Contents resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management’s expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Fair Value-Goodwill and Intangible Assets Critical Estimates. We are required to estimate the fair value and useful lives of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, in a business combination. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. We are subsequently required to assess assets acquired and goodwill for impairment. Assumptions and Judgment. Judgment used in the valuation of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including goodwill and intangible assets, can include the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate, the weighted-average cost of capital and a discount rate determined by management. We believe that the assumptions made are comparable to those that market participants would use in making estimates of fair value. Determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management’s judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factors, including the competitive environment, market share, customer history and macroeconomic situation. We determined that our Visa brand, customer relationships and Visa Europe franchise right are intangible assets with indefinite lives, based on our significant market share, history of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and historical retention rates. As a result of acquiring Fundamo in June 2011, PlaySpan in March 2011 and CyberSource in July 2010, respectively, we acquired intangible assets comprising customer relationships, tradenames and reseller relationships, which we determined have finite useful lives ranging primarily from 1 to 15 years. See Note 5—Acquisitions and Note 8—Intangible Assets, Net to our consolidated financial statements. Our assets acquired, liabilities assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting units, and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level. Indefinite-lived intangible assets. Annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, we test each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to those assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. As of February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, we evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist thereafter as reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization. Finite-lived intangible assets. We evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized. The loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that finite-lived intangible assets were impaired as of September 30, 2011. Goodwill. Review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. Goodwill impairment is reviewed using a two-step 62 Table of Contents process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment exists, and the second step is not performed. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition. We rely on a number of factors when completing impairment assessment including a review of discounted future cash flows, business plans and use of present value techniques. We evaluated our goodwill for impairment on February 1, 2011, our annual impairment review date, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. Subsequent to this annual assessment, we acquired Fundamo and PlaySpan, which resulted in additional goodwill. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment exists as reflected by the business performance of our reporting units and overall market capitalization as of September 30, 2011. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges. The carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, net were $11.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, including $10.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets and $553 million of finite-lived intangible assets, net at September 30, 2011. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. We did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal 2011. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the 63 Table of Contents allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities, including our current and deferred tax benefits associated with the settlement of the American Express litigation and the Discover litigation and other matters. See Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Cash and cash equivalents are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. We do not hold or enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We utilize a rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenues derived from and payments made in foreign currencies during the following 12 months. The aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program was $651 million and $627 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $651 million outstanding at September 30, 2011, is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results for this period could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $54 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2011. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 64 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2011 and 2010, were $1.2 billion and $135 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our investment portfolio at September 30, 2011. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $764 million and $13 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity Price Risk Visa Europe Put Option. We have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair market value at September 30, 2011. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2011, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan. Our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $783 million and $766 million and projected benefit obligations were $839 million and $743 million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2012, which we expect to make in September 2012. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. 65 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:04.808208
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2012,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our clients with payment processing platforms that encompass consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment services we provide.Overall economic conditions and regulatory environment. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2012 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery.The Dodd-Frank Act. As of October 1, 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for cards issued by large financial institutions at twenty-one cents plus five basis points, before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent. This amounted to a significant reduction from the average system-wide interchange fees charged before the Dodd-Frank Act was implemented. The Federal Reserve has also issued regulations requiring issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available for processing debit transactions on each debit card. The rules also prohibit us and issuers from restricting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transactions over any of the networks that an issuer has enabled to process those transactions. The interchange, exclusivity and routing regulations have impacted our pricing, reduced the number and volume of U.S. debit payments we process and decreased associated revenues. A number of our clients have sought fee reductions or increased incentives from us to offset their own lost revenue. Some have reduced the number of debit cards they issue and reduced investments they make in marketing and rewards programs. Some have imposed new or higher fees on debit cards or demand-deposit account relationships. Some have elected to issue fewer cards enabled with Visa-affiliated networks. Additionally, the routing regulations have allowed merchants to redirect transactions or steer cardholders to other networks based on lowest cost or other factors. We have had to re-examine and renegotiate certain of our client contracts to ensure that their terms comply with new regulations and will continue to do so with others. As a result, our clients have sought and will continue to seek to renegotiate terms relating to fees, incentives and routing. In some cases, we may lose placement completely on issuers' debit cards.During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we began implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act to some extent by making pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. For fiscal 2012, the overall net impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, including restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, was a decrease of approximately $0.15 in diluted earnings per class A common share.Our broad platform of payment products continues to provide substantial value to both merchants and consumers. We believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to electronic currency may help buffer the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act, as reflected in our overall payments volume growth, particularly outside the United States. As a leader in the U.S. debit industry, we continue to develop and refine our competitive business models to adapt to the Dodd-Frank Act and mitigate some of its negative impacts. We remain committed and prepared to adapt to and compete effectively under this new U.S. debit regulatory environment.Notice of Proposed Adjustment. On May 23, 2012, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS"") issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) to our fiscal 2008 U.S. federal income tax return seeking to disallow the 34Table of Contentsdeduction of settlement payments associated with the American Express litigation made during that fiscal year. However, on August 15, 2012, the IRS issued a Chief Counsel Advice (CCA), supporting our position that Visa is entitled to the deduction, and subsequently the IRS issued a revised Revenue Agent Report (RAR) effectively withdrawing the NOPA. The IRS may still challenge any income tax return position taken, including the deductibility of covered litigation payments made in fiscal 2008 or any future year, until the statute of limitations has closed for each applicable year. The statute of limitations for fiscal 2008 is expected to expire in June of 2013. However, given the CCA and revised RAR, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by $627 million. The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years.Multidistrict Litigation Proceedings (MDL). On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange MDL. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the MDL for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. The settlement with the class plaintiffs is subject to final court approval, which we cannot assure will be received, and to the adjudication of any appeals. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they either are non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Reversal of tax reserves. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through the third quarter of fiscal 2012. This increased our net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 by $627 million. The reversal of tax reserves and related interest included $301 million related to reserves taken in the current year, and $326 million related to reserves taken in previous years.•Litigation provision. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange MDL, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. •Deferred tax adjustment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. •Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating other income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision. The reduction in the fair value of the put option was the result of declines in our estimated long-term price-to-earnings ratio as compared to the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe and did not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. The following table presents our adjusted financial results for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. 35Table of Contents Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 (in millions, except margin ratio and per share data) Operating Expenses Operating Margin (1) Net Income Attributable to Visa Inc.

(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented.Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2012, total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million shares, using $2.4 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion, $710 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we made deposits totaling $1.7 billion of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. In July 2012, our board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013. As of September 30, 2012, the program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million. In October 2012, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed.Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and processed transactions are the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume increased as a result of continuing double-digit percentage growth in consumer credit and commercial payments volume worldwide. These increases were moderated by an anticipated deceleration in consumer debit growth, primarily due to the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Excluding U.S. debit transactions, which reflect the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate, reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency.The following tables set forth nominal payments volume for the periods presented in nominal dollars(1).36Table of Contents U.S. Rest of World Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal Payments Volume Consumer credit$710 $641 11% $1,370 $1,188 15% $2,081 $1,829 14%Consumer debit(3)1,045 1,037 1% 333 265 26% 1,378 1,302 6%Commercial and other(3)311 282 10% 130 116 12% 440 398 11%Total Nominal Payments Volume$2,066 $1,961 5% $1,833 $1,569 17% $3,899 $3,530 10%Cash volume430 404 7% 1,921 1,704 13% 2,351 2,108 12%Total Nominal Volume(4)$2,496 $2,364 6% $3,753 $3,273 15% $6,250 $5,638 11% U.S. Rest of World Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2010 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2010 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2010 (2) %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal Payments Volume Consumer credit$641 $599 7% $1,188 $987 20% $1,829 $1,586 15%Consumer debit(3)1,037 909 14% 265 197 34% 1,302 1,107 18%Commercial and other(3)282 243 16% 116 100 15% 398 344 16%Total Nominal Payments Volume$1,961 $1,752 12% $1,569 $1,285 22% $3,530 $3,037 16%Cash volume404 374 8% 1,704 1,411 21% 2,108 1,785 18%Total Nominal Volume(4)$2,364 $2,125 11% $3,273 $2,696 21% $5,638 $4,821 17%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. (2) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (3) Includes prepaid volume.(4) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to verification by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior year volume information presented in these tables has not been updated, as subsequent adjustments were not material. The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented. 37Table of Contents 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011% Change (1) 2011 vs. 2010% Change (1) (in millions) Visa processed transactions(2)53,324 50,922 45,411 5% 12%CyberSource billable transactions(3)5,182 4,137 3,032(4) 25% 36%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

(3) Transactions include, but are not limited to, authorization, settlement payment network connectivity, fraud management, payment security management, tax services and delivery address verification. Since its July 2010 acquisition, CyberSource activity has primarily contributed to our data processing revenues. (4) Includes CyberSource transactions prior to the July 2010 acquisition.Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards for goods and services, as well as the number, size and type of transactions processed on our payment processing platforms. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by cardholders on Visa-branded cards. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and determining the interest rates and fees paid by cardholders, and most other competitive card features. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for card acceptance by the issuing bank, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients, which are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, establish and earn these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist primarily of revenues earned for providing clients with a supported global business infrastructure and for services which support the various product platforms that enable clients to deliver Visa products and payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, transaction processing services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway and PlaySpan's virtual goods payment platform. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for processing cross-border transactions, and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the cardholder's issuer country is different from the merchant's country. International transaction revenues are generally driven by cross-border payments and cash volume.Other revenues consist primarily of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from cardholder services, licensing and certification and certain activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended cardholder protection and concierge services. Client incentives represent contracts with clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing primarily represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. 38Table of ContentsMarketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions to promote the Visa brand. Professional fees consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative primarily consists of facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss at the balance sheet dates. Other Income (Expense) Interest income (expense) primarily includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Investment income represents returns on our fixed-income securities and other investments. Investment income also includes gains on the sale of and cash dividends received from other investments.Other non-operating income primarily relates to gains and losses earned on equity method investments and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, in the rest of the world and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented.The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume. Operating revenues also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the U.S. during fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect low double-digit percentage growth in our operating revenues for the full 2013 fiscal year.Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. There was no significant impact on the year-over-year growth for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, as the effect of exchange rate movements was substantially mitigated through our 39Table of Contentshedging program. We expect the impacts of our hedging program to continue to minimize the effect of exchange rate movements during fiscal 2013. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2012 2011 2010 2012vs.2011 2011vs.2010 2012vs.2011 2011vs.2010 (in millions, except percentages)Service revenues$4,872 $4,261 $3,497 $611 $764 14% 22 %Data processing revenues3,975 3,478 3,125 497 353 14% 11 %International transaction revenues3,025 2,674 2,290 351 384 13% 17 %Other revenues704 655 713 49 (58) 7% (8)%Client incentives(2,155) (1,880) (1,560) (275) (320) 15% 21 %Total Operating Revenues$10,421 $9,188 $8,065 $1,233 $1,123 13% 14 %(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. •Service revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to 10% growth in nominal payments volume. The growth in service revenues was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume primarily reflecting differences in geography-specific pricing. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 16% growth in nominal payments volume combined with benefits from competitive pricing actions. •Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily as a result of the implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act to some extent through pricing modifications and working with our clients and other business partners to win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. This price restructuring included the implementation of the Fixed Acquirer Network Fee, which was partially offset by reductions in certain variable fees. While data processing fees benefited from the price restructuring that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, increased merchant and acquirer incentives executed as part of this strategy resulted in higher client incentive levels, which partially offset this increase. Data processing revenues for fiscal 2012 also benefited from overall growth in processed transactions of 5%, which reflected an anticipated decline in U.S. debit transactions processed as a result of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act becoming effective the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The deceleration in processed transaction growth was led by Interlink, one of our lowest yielding products in the U.S., which decreased 51% in the second half of fiscal 2012 compared to the same prior year period. This negative impact was more than offset by solid growth in CyberSource billable transactions, Visa transactions processed outside of the U.S., U.S. credit transactions and Visa Debit transactions, which exclude Interlink.Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to 12% growth in processed transactions and inclusion of a full year of revenue attributable to CyberSource. This growth was partially offset by the effects of negotiated pricing from certain client contracts and a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions on a net basis instead of a gross basis. •International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 primarily reflecting 11% and 18% growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively.•Other revenues increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth. Other revenues decreased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the Visa Extras rewards program on a net basis instead of a gross basis, and as a result of a large issuer that converted away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The decrease was partially offset by increases in license fees and the inclusion of revenue from our acquired entities. 40Table of Contents•Client incentives increased in fiscal 2012 reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2012, including a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act. Client incentives also increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume and certain one-time incentives incurred outside the U.S. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 18% to 18.5% for the full 2013 fiscal year.Increases in client incentives during fiscal 2011 reflected growth in global payments volume and incentives incurred on significant long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2011.Operating ExpensesThe following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses for the periods presented.

Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented.(2) Excluding the litigation provision of $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012, associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2012 were $4.2 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year on an adjusted basis.•Personnel increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to increases in headcount throughout the organization combined with higher employee incentive-related costs. The increase also reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the inclusion of new employees from our acquisitions of CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo. The increases in headcount reflect our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly outside the U.S., in support of our core business, as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. •Network and processing increased in fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher fees paid for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes.The decrease in fiscal 2011 reflects the change to present revenues and offsetting expenses associated with the processing of non-Visa network transactions on a net basis instead of on a gross basis. This decline was partially offset by increased investment in technology projects and the inclusion of CyberSource and PlaySpan activities. •Marketing remained flat in fiscal 2012 despite an increase in spending to support new product initiatives and our sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. We expect to incur under $1 billion of marketing expense in fiscal 2013, including incremental investment to support our key country growth strategies and new product initiatives. The decrease in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects a change to present revenues and offsetting expenses related to the Visa Extras rewards program on a net basis instead of on a gross basis, combined with the 41Table of Contentsimpact of a large issuer converting away from the platform entirely in June 2010. The decline in marketing expense also reflects the absence of spending associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup incurred in the prior year. The decline was partially offset by the inclusion of CyberSource activity. •Professional fees increased in fiscal 2012 and 2011, primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects to support our eCommerce and mobile initiatives.•Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2012, primarily due to additional depreciation expense from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives.The increase in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the impact of newly acquired technology and intangible assets from our acquisitions of CyberSource and PlaySpan in July 2010 and March 2011, respectively, offset by the absence of depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis in assets recorded in our October 2007 reorganization, as these assets were fully depreciated as of September 30, 2010. See Note 5—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements.•General and administrative increased primarily due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary asset and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies. The increase in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to increased travel and the inclusion of CyberSource activity, combined with reserves for a potential government assessment in one of our international geographies in fiscal 2011. •Litigation provision in fiscal 2012 reflects a $4.1 billion accrual related to litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. The credit to the provision in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of a $41 million pre-tax gain recognized related to the prepayment of the remaining obligations under the Retailers’ litigation settlement, combined with the release of accruals for certain other legal matters settled during fiscal 2010. See Note 2—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.Other Income (Expense)The following table sets forth the components of our other income (expense) for the periods presented. Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2012 2011 2010 2012vs.2011 2011vs.2010 2012vs.2011 2011vs.2010 (in millions, except percentages)Interest income (expense)$29 $(32) $(72) $61 $40 NM (55)%Investment income36 108 49 (72) 59 (67)% NMOther3 124 72 (121) 52 (98)% 73 %Total Other Income (Expense)$68 $200 $49 $(132) $151 (66)% NM(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. •Interest income for fiscal 2012 reflects the reversal of previously accrued interest associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. Interest expense in fiscal 2011 reflects lower interest accretion due to declining litigation balances as well as the reversal of previously accrued interest upon the effective settlement of uncertainties surrounding the timing of certain deductions for income tax purposes. See Note 20—Income Taxes and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. •Investment income includes pre-tax gains of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Soluções e Serviços, or CBSS, and $20 million 42Table of Contentsrecognized in fiscal 2010 related to our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund.•Other non-operating income primarily reflects non-cash adjustments to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option of $122 million and $79 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The changes in value are not subject to tax, and do not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe will exercise its option. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 is lower than the effective income tax rate of 36% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, primarily due to the impact of the following in fiscal 2012: ▪the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense;▪a decrease in our overall state tax rate due to changes in the California apportionment rules and the associated one-time, non-cash benefit of $208 million from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the $11 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our 2007 reorganization;▪a one-time benefit recognized upon initial recognition of foreign tax credits;▪the effect of applying the foregoing adjustments to a pre-tax income that was reduced by a $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and▪the absence of nontaxable revaluations of the Visa Europe put option.We expect our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate to increase to a more normalized range of 30% to 32%.Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the current or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules.

Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and43Table of Contents•optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2012 2011 2010 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$5,009 $3,872 $2,691Investing activities(2,414) (2,299) (1,904)Financing activities(2,655) (3,304) (1,542)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents7 (9) 5Decrease in cash and cash equivalents$(53) $(1,740) $(750)Operating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 compared to prior year, primarily reflecting higher operating revenue in fiscal 2012. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily reflecting continued growth in our net income and the absence of a $682 million prepayment of our Retailers' litigation obligation in fiscal 2010. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was relatively consistent, reflecting our continued investment in available-for-sale securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Comparatively, cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2010 primarily included $1.8 billion for the acquisition of CyberSource. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as-converted class A share count, either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow, and increased dividends. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 15—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investment securities, or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and return that these holdings provide. Funds held by our foreign subsidiaries include cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, both short and long-term. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, up to the amount of $2.6 billion, which we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside of the U.S. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.3 billion, are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, 44Table of Contentsand the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A—Risk Factors.Revolving credit facilities. In February 2008, we entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks including affiliates of certain holders of shares of our class B and class C common stock and certain of our clients and affiliates of our clients. Loans under the five-year facility may be in the form of: (1) Base Rate Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate; (2) Eurocurrency Advance, which will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted for applicable reserve requirements) plus an applicable cost adjustment and an applicable margin of 0.11% to 0.30% based on our credit rating; or (3) U.S. Swing Loan, Euro Swing Loan, or Foreign Currency Swing Loan, which will bear interest at the rate equal to the applicable Swing Loan rate for that currency plus the same applicable margin plus additionally for Euro and Sterling loans, an applicable reserve requirement and cost adjustment. We also agreed to pay a facility fee on the aggregate commitment amount, whether used or unused, at a rate ranging from 0.04% to 0.10% and a utilization fee on loans at a rate ranging from 0.05% to 0.10% based on our credit rating. Currently, the applicable margin is 0.15%, the facility fee is 0.05% and the utilization fee is 0.05%. This facility contains certain covenants, including financial covenant requirements relating to a maximum level of debt to EBITDA and events of default customary for financings of this type. This facility expires on February 15, 2013. We are in the process of replacing this facility in fiscal 2013. There were no borrowings under this facility and we were in compliance with all covenants during and at the end of fiscal 2012.U.S. commercial paper program. We maintain a $500 million U.S. commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of unsecured debt with maturities up to 270 days from the date of issuance at interest rates generally extended to companies with comparable credit ratings. The commercial paper program is a source of short-term borrowed funds that may be used from time to time to cover short-term cash needs. We had no obligations outstanding under this program during and at the end of fiscal 2012. There are no financial covenants related to this program.Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. The registration statement expires in July 2015. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When the Company funds the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2012, was $4.4 billion and is reflected as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.Credit RatingsAt September 30, 2012, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Stable P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Stable A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity 45Table of ContentsPayments settlement. Payments settlement due from and due to issuing and acquiring clients represents a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2012, we often did not need to fund settlement working capital as indicated by the fact that our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $43 million, although our greatest working capital requirement was a peak net settlement receivable balance of $587 million.Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2012, we made $140 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2012 the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $4.4 billion. In October 2012, we made an additional payment of $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2012, total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22.8 million shares, using $2.4 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $2.4 billion, $710 million was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we made deposits totaling $1.7 billion of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. These deposits have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock, because they reduce the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. In July 2012, our board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2013. At September 30, 2012, this share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $865 million. In October 2012, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through October 2013. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2012 have been completed. See Note 15—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During fiscal 2012, we paid $595 million in dividends. On October 24, 2012, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.33 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $221 million in connection with this dividend in December 2012. See Note 15—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Class B and class C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the ""P/E ratio"" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the ""adjusted sustainable income"" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. At September 30, 2012, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each 46Table of Contentscase, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2012, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2012, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2012, the spot P/E ratio was 18.8x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.8x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future.

We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. Funding does not impact current period pension expense but has the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan. In fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $88 million, $74 million, and $66 million, respectively. In fiscal 2013, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plan by approximately $52 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2012 due to investment in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $425 million to $475 million range in fiscal 2013, as we continue to make ongoing investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. Acquisitions. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2012, compared to fiscal 2011, when we acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received. See Note 5—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair 47Table of Contentsvalue. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2012, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $9.8 billion of assets and $168 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $164 million, or less than 2%, had significant unobservable inputs, with the Visa Europe put option liability constituting $145 million of this amount. At September 30, 2012, debt instruments in this category included $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered by failure of any other customer to honor Visa cards, traveler's cheques, or other instruments processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2012. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities, or the litigation escrow account.

(2) Includes both operating and capital leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. (3) Represents future cash payments for incentive agreements with select clients under various programs designed to build payments volume, increase acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume / growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on customer performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 18—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 48Table of Contentsrepresent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements which we estimate we will record. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants, and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings on October 19, 2012. The amount in the table represents the maximum amount expected to be paid out in fiscal 2013 under the class plaintiffs' settlement agreement and the individual plaintiffs' settlement agreement from the litigation escrow account. This amount includes the $350 million payment to the Individual Plaintiffs' Settlement Fund made in October 2012. A litigation provision of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation was booked during fiscal 2012. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. (6) Includes expected dividend amount of $221 million as dividends were declared on October 24, 2012 and will be paid on December 4, 2012 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 16, 2012. (7) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $139 million. At September 30, 2012, we also accrued $20 million of interest and $7 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(8) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2012 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See Liquidity and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (9) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical Estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with select clients and other business partners designed to build payments volume, increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. 49Table of ContentsThe capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clauses, such as early termination clauses, management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clauses and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contractsAssumptions and Judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenue. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2012, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues.Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical Estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2012. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and Judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of Exercise—Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: 50Table of Contents(i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E Differential—The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S). We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weight long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolio, long-term growth rates or new product innovation. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of the comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weight these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical Estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and Judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability 51Table of Contentsand whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We recorded an additional accrual of $4.1 billion for the covered litigation during fiscal 2012. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 21—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical Estimates. In calculating our effective tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and Judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskAlthough most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program were $739 million and $651 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The aggregate notional amount of $739 million outstanding at September 30, 2012, is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $40 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2012. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency 52Table of Contentspositions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Our operating results or cash flows have not been, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2012 and 2011 were $3.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $42 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2012. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $923 million and $764 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Visa Europe Put OptionWe have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2012. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2012, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan RiskOur U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $973 million and $783 million and projected benefit obligations were $990 million and $839 million at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal 2013, which we expect to make in September 2013. 53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:06.228425
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2013,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments around the world to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide.Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2013 reflects the impacts of a slow-moving global economic recovery.Interchange multidistrict litigation. On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. The court entered the preliminary approval order of the settlement agreement on November 27, 2012. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Until the settlement agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated, no assurance can be provided that Visa will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs’ claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement. We also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the interchange multidistrict litigation for coordination of pre-trial proceedings. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, we paid $350 million from the litigation escrow account to the individual merchants on October 29, 2012, and on November 6, 2012, the court entered an order dismissing the individual merchants' claims with prejudice. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 33 million shares of our class A common stock using $5.4 billion of cash on hand. In July 2013, our board of directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to be in effect through July 2014. As of September 30, 2013, the July program had remaining authorized funds of $251 million. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to July 2013 have been completed. In October 2013, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the prior or future years, as they either are non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Reversal of tax reserves. During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This increased our net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million.•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2012, we recorded a litigation provision of $4.1 billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 31Table of Contents•Deferred tax adjustment. During fiscal 2012, our reported financial results benefited from a one-time, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. •Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a decrease of $122 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which resulted in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating income in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision. The following tables present our adjusted financial results for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.

The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision.Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Compared to the prior year, overall payments volume grew in all categories worldwide except U.S. consumer debit, which has been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012. The number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate, reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 32Table of ContentsThe following tables present nominal payments volume.(1) United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal Payments Volume Consumer credit$789 $710 11% $1,498 $1,375 9% $2,287 $2,085 10%Consumer debit(3)1,046 1,045 —% 392 329 19% 1,438 1,375 5%Commercial and other(3)331 311 7% 140 130 8% 472 440 7%Total Nominal Payments Volume$2,166 $2,066 5% $2,030 $1,834 11% $4,197 $3,900 8%Cash volume446 437 2% 2,083 1,920 8% 2,529 2,357 7%Total Nominal Volume(4)$2,612 $2,503 4% $4,114 $3,754 10% $6,726 $6,257 7% United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012 (2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2011 (2) %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal Payments Volume Consumer credit$710 $641 11% $1,375 $1,191 15% $2,085 $1,832 14%Consumer debit(3)1,045 1,038 1% 329 265 25% 1,375 1,303 6%Commercial and other(3)311 282 10% 130 116 12% 440 398 11%Total Nominal Payments Volume$2,066 $1,962 5% $1,834 $1,571 17% $3,900 $3,533 10%Cash volume437 402 9% 1,920 1,704 13% 2,357 2,106 12%Total Nominal Volume(4)$2,503 $2,363 6% $3,754 $3,276 15% $6,257 $5,639 11%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. (2) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, were based on payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (3) Includes prepaid volume.(4) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on Visa-branded cards and payment products. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented.(1) 33Table of Contents 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012% Change (1) 2012 vs. 2011% Change (1) (in millions, except percentages)Visa processed transactions(2)58,472 53,324 50,922 10% 5%CyberSource billable transactions(3)6,533 5,182 4,137 26% 25%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our financial institution clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, licensing and certification, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, fringe benefits and contractor expense. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. 34Table of ContentsMarketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of travel activities, facilities costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.Non-operating Income Non-operating income mainly includes accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions; income, gains and losses earned on investments; and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented.The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. Operating revenue growth also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services. These benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the United States during the second half of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2013, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about one percentage point in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2012. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2014, a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2014, net of offsetting hedges. See Note 12—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. 35Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues.

Percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. •Service revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 primarily due to 8% and 10% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in service revenues in fiscal 2012 was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume due to a shift in the mix of our payments volume, primarily in volume related to Interlink, which is a debit product that does not generate any service revenues.•Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10% and 5%, respectively, combined with pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act.•International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 primarily reflecting 10% and 11% growth in nominal cross-border volume, respectively. •Other revenues increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012 due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth.•Client incentives increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012, reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. These included a number of significant long-term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as issuer contracts executed in fiscal 2013. Additionally, client incentives increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume. Activity in fiscal 2012 also reflects certain one-time incentives incurred outside the United States. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5% for the full 2014 fiscal year. 36Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses.

The increase in fiscal 2012 is primarily due to increases in headcount, and reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of PlaySpan and Fundamo in March 2011 and June 2011, respectively.•Marketing remained relatively flat in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 when compared to the respective prior year. Fiscal 2013 activity mainly reflected strategies to promote our core products, combined with a number of various campaigns, including the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Marketing in fiscal 2012 mainly reflected sponsorship of the 2012 London Summer Olympics, as well as spend in support of our new product initiatives.•Network and processing in fiscal 2013 and 2012 increased mainly due to costs incurred for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes.•Professional fees increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012, primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects.•Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2013 and 2012, primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives.•General and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 after experiencing an increase in fiscal 2012 mainly due to travel activities in support of our international expansion, combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2011 upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies. •Litigation provision in fiscal 2012 reflects a $4.1 billion accrual related to the covered litigation. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.Non-operating IncomeNon-operating income in fiscal 2013 of $18 million decreased from $68 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012 of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. See Note 19—Income Taxes and Note 20—Legal Matters 37Table of Contentsto our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in fiscal 2012 from $200 million in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to:•the absence of a $122 million non-cash adjustment to the fair market value of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011; and•the absence of a pre-tax gain of $85 million recognized in fiscal 2011 upon the sale of our investment in Visa Vale issuer Companhia Brasileira de Soluções e Serviços, or CBSS; offset by•the reversal of previously accrued interest expense discussed above.Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rates of 3% and 36% in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, mainly due to:•the decrease in overall ongoing state tax rate beginning in fiscal 2012 as a result of changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year;•a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012;•certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013; and•the absence of the following in fiscal 2013:•the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense;•a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year;•the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision; and•the nontaxable revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2011.Adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in that or future years, as they were either non-recurring, had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules.

Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to: 38Table of Contents•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2013 2012 2011 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$3,022 $5,009 $3,872Investing activities(1,164) (2,414) (2,299)Financing activities(1,746) (2,655) (3,304)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents— 7 (9)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$112 $(53) $(1,740)Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was lower during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year, reflecting payments from the litigation escrow account totaling $4.4 billion in connection with the covered litigation. As these payments were made from our litigation escrow account, they were also reflected as cash inflows under financing activities. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The tax deduction related to these payments contributed to the $1.5 billion decline in overall income taxes paid during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year. Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities would have totaled $5.9 billion, an increase over fiscal 2012, reflecting continued growth in operating revenues. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting higher operating revenues in fiscal 2012. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2013 compared to prior year, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was relatively consistent, reflecting our continued investment in available-for-sale securities.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as-converted class A share count, either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow, and increased dividends. Cash used in financing activities also reflects cash inflows relating to payments made in connection with the covered litigation from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan, Note 14—Stockholders' Equity and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio, and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, our access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $4.3 billion at September 30, 2013. If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use 39Table of Contentsin the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries, which we estimate to be approximately $3.8 billion. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in the United States.Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $2.8 billion, are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A—Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. On February 7, 2013, we replaced the existing $500 million program with a new commercial paper program. Under the new program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the new program at September 30, 2013. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.Credit facility. On January 31, 2013, we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. This credit facility, which expires on January 30, 2014, replaced our existing $3.0 billion credit facility, which would have expired on February 15, 2013. The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under the new credit facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants at September 30, 2013. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2015. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2013, was $49 million and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.Credit RatingsAt September 30, 2013, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Stable P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Stable A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 40Table of ContentsUses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2013, however, we were only required to fund settlement-related working capital on a few days, including a peak net settlement receivable balance of $36 million. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $198 million. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2013, we made $4.4 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, of which, $4.0 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the settlement agreement, if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement, defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of no more than 25% of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund, based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Upon final court approval of the settlement agreement, Visa's portion of the takedown payments, calculated to be $1.1 billion, will increase our current taxable income. The resulting increase in our current taxable income will increase our deferred tax asset and income tax payable by $387 million, which will have a negative impact on our free cash flow in the year the final court approval is rendered. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. At September 30, 2013, the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $49 million. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased 33 million shares of our class A common stock using $5.4 billion of operating cash on hand. At September 30, 2013, we had $251 million of remaining funds available for share repurchases under the current program authorized by the board of directors. In October 2013, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During fiscal 2013, we paid $864 million in dividends. In October 2013, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.40 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $255 million in connection with this dividend on December 3, 2013. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by our board of directors. Classes of B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the ""P/E ratio"" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the ""adjusted sustainable income"" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2013, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation, which could be several billion dollars or more. We may 41Table of Contentsneed to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $100 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $100 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2013, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $25 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $100 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2013, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2013, the spot P/E ratio was 21.5x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.1x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. Visa Inc’s ForwardPrice-to-Earnings Ratio Payout AssumingAdjusted SustainableIncome of $100 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payoutfor Each $25 million ofAdjusted SustainableIncome Above/Below $100 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $2,500 $625 20 $2,000 $500 15 $1,500 $375 (1) Given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more.Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million, $88 million, and $74 million, respectively. The lower contribution in fiscal 2013 was driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at September 30, 2013 compared to September 30, 2012. In fiscal 2014, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $12 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2013 due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our eCommerce and mobile initiatives. Acquisitions. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 and 2012, compared to fiscal 2011, when we acquired PlaySpan and Fundamo for a total of $268 million, net of $22 million in cash received. We will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future. 42Table of ContentsFair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2013, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $6.0 billion of assets and $160 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $152 million, or 2%, had significant unobservable inputs, including the Visa Europe put option liability of $145 million, and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other clients to honor Visa-branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2013. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities.

(2) Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. (3) Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to 43Table of Contentsexisting contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to help increase Visa-branded cards and volumes. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes expected dividend amount of $255 million as dividends were declared in October 2013 and will be paid on December 3, 2013 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 15, 2013. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $453 million. At September 30, 2013, we also accrued $29 million of interest and $3 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2013 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued 44Table of Contentssystematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2013, client incentives represented 16% of gross operating revenues.Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2013. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised, which could be several billion dollars or more. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise—Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. 45Table of ContentsP/E differential—The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2013. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. 46Table of ContentsOur retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal 2013. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskAlthough most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $1.3 billion and $739 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2013, is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $85 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2013. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. 47Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2013 and 2012 were $3.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $38 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2013. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.1 billion and $923 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Visa Europe Put OptionWe have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2013. We are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2013, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan RiskOur U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion and $973 million and projected benefit obligations were $897 million and $990 million at September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2014, if any, which would be made in September 2014. 48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:05.741962
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2014,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide.Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2014 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. Financial highlights. During fiscal 2014, we recorded net income of $5.4 billion or $8.62 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 9% and 14% over the prior year, respectively. For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share as follows: Fiscal Year endedSeptember 30, % Change(1) 2014 2013 2012 2014vs.2013 2013vs.2012 (in millions, except percentages)Net income, as adjusted(2)$5,721 $4,980 $4,203 15% 18%Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted(2)$9.07 $7.59 $6.20 19% 23%(1) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 and 2012 exclude the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.We recorded net operating revenues of $12.7 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of 8% over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year resulted in a two percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth.Total operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $5.0 billion, and included $450 million of litigation provision related to the interchange multidistrict litigation. Excluding this provision, adjusted operating expenses remained flat at $4.6 billion over prior year operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in professional fees and personnel expenses, offset by continued investments in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support our global growth initiatives.Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. 31Table of ContentsThe following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.

(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Operating margin and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers, not the rounded numbers presented.(3) During fiscal 2014 and 2012, we recorded litigation provisions of $450 million and $4.1 billion, respectively, and related tax benefits, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.(4) During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This resulted in a non-recurring increase in net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million. Additionally, our reported financial results benefited from a non-recurring, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.Interchange multidistrict litigation. On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received on January 27, 2014, and deposited into the litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued 32Table of Contentslitigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account and recorded an additional accrual of $450 million associated with the opt-out claims, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to covered litigation of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2014. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014, total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion, $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. The stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2013. As of September 30, 2014, the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume growth in the United States gained momentum over the prior year, with sustained double-digit growth in consumer credit, elevated growth in consumer debit, which had been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012, and double-digit growth in commercial products. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 is 15% compared to 14% for the prior year comparable period. Continued double-digit growth in the number of processed transactions accelerated modestly over the prior year, reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 33Table of ContentsThe following tables present nominal payments volume.(1) United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2014(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013(2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2014(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013(2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2014(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013(2) %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$872 $786 11% $1,600 $1,498 7% $2,471 $2,284 8%Consumer debit(3)1,127 1,046 8% 454 392 16% 1,581 1,438 10%Commercial(4)370 334 11% 145 140 3% 515 474 9%Total nominal payments volume$2,369 $2,167 9% $2,198 $2,030 8% $4,567 $4,196 9%Cash volume468 446 5% 2,122 2,083 2% 2,590 2,529 2%Total nominal volume(5)$2,837 $2,613 9% $4,320 $4,113 5% $7,157 $6,726 6% United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012(2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012(2) %Change 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013(2) 12 monthsendedJune 30,2012(2) %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$786 $710 11% $1,498 $1,374 9% $2,284 $2,085 10%Consumer debit(3)1,046 1,045 —% 392 329 19% 1,438 1,375 5%Commercial(4)334 311 8% 140 130 8% 474 440 8%Total nominal payments volume$2,167 $2,066 5% $2,030 $1,833 11% $4,196 $3,900 8%Cash volume446 437 2% 2,083 1,920 8% 2,529 2,357 7%Total nominal volume(5)$2,613 $2,503 4% $4,113 $3,754 10% $6,726 $6,257 7%The following table presents nominal and constant payments volume growth.(1) International Visa Inc. 12 monthsendedJune 30,2014 vs 2013 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013 vs 2012 12 monthsendedJune 30,2014 vs 2013 12 monthsendedJune 30,2013 vs 2012 Nominal(2) Constant(6) Nominal(2) Constant(6) Nominal(2) Constant(6) Nominal(2) Constant(6)Payments volume growth Consumer credit7% 13% 9% 12% 8% 12% 10% 12%Consumer debit(3)16% 24% 19% 24% 10% 12% 5% 5%Commercial(4)3% 10% 8% 11% 9% 11% 8% 8%Total payments volume growth8% 15% 11% 14% 9% 12% 8% 9%Cash volume growth2% 9% 8% 12% 2% 8% 7% 10%Total volume growth5% 12% 10% 13% 6% 11% 7% 9%(1) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(3) Includes prepaid volume.(4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as prepaid volume.(5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on Visa-branded cards and payment products. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. 35Table of ContentsOther revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, licensing and certification, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expense. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.Non-operating Income Non-operating income mainly includes income, gains and losses earned on investments, accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 36Table of ContentsThe increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to prior year due to the negative impact of lower foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2014, combined with the absence of pricing modifications that benefited fiscal 2013.Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2014, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about two percentage points in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2013. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2015, a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2015, net of offsetting hedges. See Note 12—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues.

Fiscal 2013 also benefited from the full-year impact of pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act.•International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily reflecting 8% and 10% growth in nominal cross-border payments volume, respectively. The fiscal 2014 growth in international transaction revenues was slower than the growth in nominal cross-border payments volume for the comparable period mainly due to lower volatility in a broad range of currencies.•Other revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 due to an increase in license fees as well as increases in optional service or product enhancements.•Client incentives increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013, reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2014 and 2013, as well as overall growth in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% for the full 2015 fiscal year. 37Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) Excluding the litigation provisions of $450 million recorded in fiscal 2014 and $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012 associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2014 and 2012 were $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the percentage change of fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 is flat and fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 is an increase of 8%.•Personnel decreased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to lower incentive compensation and severance charges, reductions in our net periodic pension cost and the absence of one-time share-based compensation expenses previously recognized in fiscal 2013. These decreases were partially offset by a continued increase in headcount throughout the organization reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. The increase in fiscal 2013 is primarily due to increases in headcount and higher severance charges as a result of organizational restructuring that aligns with our strategic priorities.•Marketing increased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to elevated spend supporting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup campaigns, combined with increased spend in the second half of the year to support our growth strategies and new product initiatives, such as Visa Checkout. Marketing in fiscal 2013 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting strategies to promote our products in each of those years and spend on specific campaigns, such as the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and preparation for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in fiscal 2013 and the 2012 London Summer Olympics in fiscal 2012. •Network and processing in fiscal 2014 and 2013 increased mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth.•Professional fees decreased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to the absence of certain project costs incurred in fiscal 2013 as part of our effort to align resources with our strategic priorities.•Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013, primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.•General and administrative increased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to facilities costs and other corporate expenses in support of our business growth and the disposal of obsolete technology assets, partially offset by a decrease in travel activities. General and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. •Litigation provision in fiscal 2014 and 2012 reflects $450 million and $4.1 billion accruals, respectively, related to the covered litigation. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 38Table of ContentsNon-operating IncomeNon-operating income in fiscal 2014 of $27 million increased from $18 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in fiscal 2013 from $68 million in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012 of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. See Note 19—Income Taxes and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 30% in fiscal 2014 differs from the effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 mainly due to:•a $264 million tax benefit related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million related to prior fiscal years, as a result of the completion of a study in the second quarter of fiscal 2014; and•the absence of the following in fiscal 2014:•a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and•certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013.The effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 mainly due to:•the aforementioned tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012;•certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013, as mentioned above; and•the absence of the following in fiscal 2013:•the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense;•a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; and•the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision. Adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012. Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in that or future years, as they were either non-recurring, had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules.

Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2014 2013 2012 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$7,205 $3,022 $5,009Investing activities(941) (1,164) (2,414)Financing activities(6,478) (1,746) (2,655)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(1) — 7(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(215) $112 $(53)Operating activities. Reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, including:•the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid; and•payments of $4.4 billion made in fiscal 2013 from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of $1.5 billion in overall income taxes paid.The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan.Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities increased in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 to approximately $6.5 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, reflecting growth in total operating revenues in both years. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, offset by a decrease in proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. We also used cash on hand to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest ownership. Cash used in investing activities was 40Table of Contentslower during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.Financing activities. Reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above under operating activities as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Additionally, reported financing activities include deposits into the litigation escrow account of $450 million and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2012, respectively. Absent all of the above impacts, which are related to the interchange litigation, cash used in financing activities was $5.0 billion, $6.1 billion and $940 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2014 and increase in fiscal 2013 are primarily due to changes in cash used to repurchase shares of our class A common stock in the open market. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan, Note 14—Stockholders' Equity and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $5.5 billion at September 30, 2014. If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $5.0 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable.Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.0 billion, are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A—Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2014. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.Credit facility. On January 29, 2014, we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 28, 2015, replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 29, 2014. The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2014. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2015. 41Table of ContentsLitigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2014, was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.Credit RatingsAt September 30, 2014, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Stable P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Stable A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2014, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $261 million.Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2013, we made $4.4 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, of which, $4.0 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation. On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants was received in January 2014, and deposited into the litigation escrow account. Receipt of the takedown payments increases our current taxable income by approximately $1.1 billion, and income tax payable by about $368 million, which was fully paid by the end of fiscal 2014. At September 30, 2014, the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014, total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion, $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. 42Table of ContentsThe stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2013. As of September 30, 2014, the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During fiscal 2014, we paid $1.0 billion in dividends. In October 2014, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.48 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $297 million in connection with this dividend on December 2, 2014. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Classes of B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the ""P/E ratio"" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the ""adjusted sustainable income"" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2014, we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2014, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2014, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9x. At September 30, 2014, the spot P/E ratio was 20.6x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 2.0x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. 43Table of Contents Visa Inc’s ForwardPrice-to-Earnings Ratio Payout AssumingAdjusted SustainableIncome of $500 million(1) Increase/Decrease in Payoutfor Each $100 million ofAdjusted SustainableIncome Above/Below $500 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $12,500 $2,500 20 $10,000 $2,000 15 $7,500 $1,500 (1) Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion.Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $14 million, $4 million, and $88 million, respectively. The lower contributions in fiscal 2014 and 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012, were driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets and an increase in the discount rate. In fiscal 2015, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $10 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2014 due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. During fiscal 2014, we acquired a business in which we previously held a minority interest using $134 million of cash on hand. This amount primarily reflects the purchase price of $170 million less cash received. The acquisition extends our processing capabilities internationally. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 and 2012.Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2014, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $7.3 billion of assets and $151 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $152 million had significant unobservable inputs, including the Visa Europe put option liability of $145 million, and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if 44Table of Contentscertain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2014. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities.

(3) Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa-branded product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes expected dividend amount of $297 million as dividends were declared in October 2014 and will be paid on December 2, 2014 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 14, 2014. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $855 million. At September 30, 2014, we had also accrued $39 million of interest and $5 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the current economic conditions and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would 45Table of Contentslikely be in excess of $10 billion. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2014 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2014, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues.Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is 46Table of Contentsexercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2014. While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise—Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E differential—The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. 47Table of ContentsOther estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2014. Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. In fiscal 2014, we recorded litigation accruals totaling $1.5 billion for covered litigation, reflecting $1.1 billion of take-down payments received and an additional provision of $450 million. See Note 3—Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. 48Table of ContentsImpact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskAlthough most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $1.3 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2014 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $90 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2014. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2014 and 2013 were $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $32 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2014. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Visa Europe Put OptionWe have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe, which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2014. We are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis, and record adjustments as necessary. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.9x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an 49Table of Contentsincrease of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2014 and 2013, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion, and projected benefit obligations were $983 million and $897 million, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2015, if any, which would be made in September 2015. 50Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:08.299413
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2015,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide.Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2015 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth. Visa Europe acquisition. On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement with Visa Europe, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to €21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of €11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately €5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to €4.0 billion (plus up to an additional €0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. In conjunction with the transaction agreement, the Visa Europe put option was amended to align the terms on which Visa Europe may exercise its rights under the put option agreement with the terms of the transaction agreement. The purchase of Visa Europe's share capital will be effected through the exercise of the amended Visa Europe put option. The preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, Visa Europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory. As part of the acquisition, we also entered into the U.K. loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europe’s members located in the United Kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or Visa Europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom. See Note 2—Visa Europe, Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities, and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The closing of our acquisition of Visa Europe is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in our fiscal third quarter of 2016.Financial highlights. During fiscal 2015, we recorded net income of $6.3 billion or diluted class A earnings per share of $2.58, an increase of 16% and 20% over the prior year, respectively. Our non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, % Change(1) 2015 2014 2013 2015vs.2014 2014vs.2013 (in millions, except percentages)Net income, as adjusted(2)$6,438 $5,721 $4,980 13% 15%Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted(2),(3)$2.62 $2.27 $1.90 16% 19%(1) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 33Table of Contents(2) Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.(3) The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. Our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2014 reflect a one-time tax benefit of $191 million associated with a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities related to fiscal years 2013 and prior. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.We recorded net operating revenues of $13.9 billion for fiscal 2015, an increase of 9% over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year resulted in a two-and-a-half- percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth.Total operating expenses for fiscal 2015 were $4.8 billion, a decrease of 4% over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of a $450 million litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation recorded in fiscal 2014. Excluding this provision, operating expenses increased by 6% over prior year adjusted operating expenses, primarily due to increases in personnel, additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure, and general and administrative expenses. The increases were partially offset by decreases in network and processing and marketing expenses.Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years, as they either have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded an increase of $110 million in the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash, non-operating expense in our financial results. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. •Litigation provision. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of $450 million and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.The following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2015 and 2014. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.

(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Operating margin and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(3) The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015.Class A common stock split. In January 2015, Visa’s board of directors declared a four-for-one split of its class A common stock. Each class A common stockholder of record at the close of business on February 13, 2015 (""Record Date"") received a dividend of three additional shares on March 18, 2015 for every share held as of the Record Date. Trading began on a split-adjusted basis on March 19, 2015. Holders of class B and C common stock did not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for class B common stock increased to 1.6483 shares of class A common stock per share of class B common stock, and the conversion rate for class C common stock increased to 4.0 shares of class A common stock per share of class C common stock. Immediately following the split, the class A, B and C stockholders retained the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements.Reduction in as-converted class A common stock. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2015, we had remaining authorized funds of $2.8 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have been completed. In October 2015, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015(1) was 13% compared to 15% for the prior year comparable period. Processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 35Table of ContentsThe following tables present nominal payments volume.(2) United States International Visa Inc. 12 months ended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 2015 2014 %Change 2015 2014 %Change 2015 2014 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$980 $872 12% $1,676 $1,600 5 % $2,656 $2,472 7 %Consumer debit(3)1,201 1,128 7% 463 454 2 % 1,665 1,581 5 %Commercial(4)412 370 11% 151 145 4 % 563 515 9 %Total nominal payments volume$2,594 $2,369 9% $2,290 $2,198 4 % $4,884 $4,567 7 %Cash volume492 469 5% 2,016 2,122 (5)% 2,508 2,591 (3)%Total nominal volume(5)$3,086 $2,838 9% $4,306 $4,320 — % $7,392 $7,158 3 % United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 months ended June 30,(1) 2014 2013 %Change 2014 2013 %Change 2014 2013 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$872 $786 11% $1,600 $1,498 7% $2,472 $2,284 8%Consumer debit(3)1,128 1,046 8% 454 392 16% 1,581 1,438 10%Commercial(4)370 334 11% 145 140 3% 515 474 9%Total nominal payments volume$2,369 $2,167 9% $2,198 $2,030 8% $4,567 $4,197 9%Cash volume469 446 5% 2,122 2,083 2% 2,591 2,530 2%Total nominal volume(5)$2,838 $2,613 9% $4,320 $4,113 5% $7,158 $6,726 6%The following table presents nominal and constant payments volume growth.(2) International Visa Inc. 12 months endedJune 30,2015 vs 2014(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2014 vs 2013(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2015 vs 2014(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2014 vs 2013(1) Nominal Constant(6) Nominal Constant(6) Nominal Constant(6) Nominal Constant(6)Payments volume growth Consumer credit5 % 13% 7% 13% 7 % 13% 8% 12%Consumer debit(3)2 % 14% 16% 24% 5 % 9% 10% 12%Commercial(4)4 % 13% 3% 10% 9 % 12% 9% 11%Total payments volume growth4 % 13% 8% 15% 7 % 11% 9% 12%Cash volume growth(5)% 8% 2% 9% (3)% 7% 2% 8%Total volume growth— % 11% 5% 12% 3 % 10% 6% 10%(1) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.(2) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume. 36Table of Contents(4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron and Interlink brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (6)Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.The following table provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, including transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS cards processed on Visa's networks during the fiscal periods presented.(1) 2015(2) 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014% Change 2014 vs. 2013% Change (in millions, except percentages)Visa processed transactions70,968 64,993 58,472 9% 11%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Prior period updates are not material.(2) As a result of recent changes in Russian National Payment System law, we have transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian National Payment Card System during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after the transition.Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. 37Table of ContentsClient incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expense. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for legal, consulting and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.Non-operating (Expense) IncomeNon-operating (expense) income mainly includes the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, income, gains and losses earned on investments, and accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with higher foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues. 38Table of ContentsOur operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2015, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about two-and-a-half percentage points in total operating revenue growth.The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. •Service revenues increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014 primarily due to 7% and 9% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. Service revenues also benefited from select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.•Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 9% and 11%, respectively. •International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2014 increase was primarily due to 8% growth in nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. •Client incentives increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume as well as incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2015 and 2014. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. 39Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) Excluding the litigation provision of $450 million recorded in fiscal 2014 associated with litigation covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $4.6 billion. On an adjusted basis, the percentage change of fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014 is an increase of 6%, and fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 was flat.•Personnel increased in fiscal 2015 primarily due to a continued increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, particularly in internal technology resources, combined with higher incentive compensation. The decrease in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to lower incentive compensation and severance charges, reductions in our net periodic pension cost and the absence of one-time share-based compensation expenses previously recognized in fiscal 2013, partially offset by an increase in headcount.•Marketing decreased in fiscal 2015 mainly due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to U.S. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup spend incurred in fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially offset by on-going advertising and promotional campaigns to support our growth strategies and new product initiatives, such as Visa Checkout, which began in the second half of fiscal 2014. The increase in marketing during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was also attributable to elevated spend supporting the two sporting campaigns. •Network and processing in fiscal 2015 decreased as a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. The increase in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth.•Professional fees in fiscal 2015 were flat compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the absence of certain project costs incurred in fiscal 2013 as part of our effort to align resources with our strategic priorities.•Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2015 and 2014, primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.•General and administrative increased in fiscal 2015 mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal 2015 upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currency and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets. Fiscal 2014 increased mainly due to facilities costs and other corporate expenses, and the disposal of obsolete technology assets, partially offset by a decrease in travel activities. 40Table of Contents•Litigation provision in fiscal 2014 reflects a $450 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements.Non-operating (Expense) IncomeNon-operating expense in fiscal 2015 primarily reflects a non-cash adjustment to the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option of $110 million, which is not subject to tax. The change in value did not reflect any change in the likelihood that Visa Europe would exercise its option in its unamended form at September 30, 2015. See Note 2—Visa Europe and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Non-operating income in fiscal 2014 increased from fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rates were 30% in fiscal 2015 and 2014. The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year:•a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million is a one-time $239 million tax benefit that relates to prior fiscal years; and•a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years.The effective income tax rate of 30% in fiscal 2014 differs from the effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 mainly due to:•the aforementioned $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014; and•the absence of the following in fiscal 2014:•a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and •certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 41Table of ContentsCash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2015 2014 2013 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$6,584 $7,205 $3,022Investing activities(1,435) (941) (1,164)Financing activities(3,603) (6,478) (1,746)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents1 (1) —Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$1,547 $(215) $112Operating activities. Reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, including:•payments of $426 million made from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015; •the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid; and•payments of $4.4 billion made in fiscal 2013 from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of $1.5 billion in overall income taxes paid.The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan.Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 to approximately $6.9 billion, $6.5 billion, and $5.9 billion respectively, reflecting growth in total operating revenues in all three years. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was greater during fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, offset by an increase in cash used to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 7—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements.Financing activities. Reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Additionally, reported financing activities in fiscal 2014 include deposits into the litigation escrow account of $450 million. Absent these impacts, which are related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, cash used in financing activities was $4.0 billion, $5.0 billion and $6.1 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The changes in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are primarily due to the repurchase of class A common stock in the open market. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities, Note 14—Stockholders' Equity and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. 42Table of ContentsCash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $7.0 billion at September 30, 2015. If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued a U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $6.4 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable.Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.4 billion, are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A—Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2015. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.Credit facility. On January 28, 2015, we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 27, 2016, replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 28, 2015. The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2015. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018.Expected debt issuance and change in capital structure. In conjunction with the potential Visa Europe acquisition, we intend to evolve our long-term capital structure. We intend to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between $15.0 billion and $16.0 billion in the first half of fiscal year 2016, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years, depending on market conditions. The proceeds from the debt issuance will be used to fund the upfront cash consideration of the acquisition, and increase the repurchase of class A common stock outstanding in 2016 and 2017 to offset the effect of the expected issuance of preferred stock upon the closing of the acquisition. Our initial leverage is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.5 times gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. We expect our long-term leverage to be between 1.1 and 1.5 times gross debt to EBITDA, maintaining flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities. We expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings disclosed below.Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2015, was $1.1 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. 43Table of ContentsCredit RatingsAt September 30, 2015, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Stable P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Stable A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2015, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $272 million.Visa Europe acquisition. On November 2, 2015, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to € 21.2 billion. The purchase price consists of: (a) at the closing of the transaction, up-front cash consideration of €11.5 billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, valued at approximately €5.0 billion, and (b) following the end of sixteen fiscal quarters post-closing, contingent cash consideration of up to €4.0 billion (plus up to an additional €0.7 billion in interest), determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue levels during such post-closing period. Closing is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of 2016. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.We also signed an option amendment, which amended the terms of the Visa Europe put option agreement to reflect the terms of the transaction agreement. If the acquisition of Visa Europe, as described above, is not completed, the put option will revert to its original, unamended form. The unamended put option agreement, if exercised, would require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. If the acquisition does not close and the put option reverts to its unamended terms, Visa Europe may exercise the unamended put option at any time thereafter. The unamended put option agreement provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the unamended option is exercised, to Visa Europe's adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, under the unamended terms, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option under its unamended terms, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2015, we determined the fair value of the unamended put option liability to be approximately $255 million. While this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised under its unamended terms. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. 44Table of ContentsGiven the perpetual nature of the unamended put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2015, or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its put option in its unamended form, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2015, our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 21.3x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.5x. At September 30, 2015, the spot P/E ratio was 23.2x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.8x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future in its unamended form.

We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2015, we made $426 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, reflecting settlements with the individual opt-out merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. At September 30, 2015, the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.1 billion. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted class A common stock. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2015, we had remaining authorized funds of $2.8 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have been completed. In October 2015, our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During fiscal 2015, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends. In October 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.14 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $341 million in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2015. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Holders of class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also 45Table of Contentssponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $19 million, $14 million, and $4 million, respectively. In fiscal 2016, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $12 million. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased during fiscal 2015 reflecting the investments to upgrade our processing network during the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we acquired businesses in which we previously held a minority interest using $93 million and $134 million of cash on hand, respectively. These amounts primarily reflect the respective purchase price, less cash received. These acquisitions help to expand our loyalty solutions for merchants by strengthening our merchant offers capabilities, and extend our processing capabilities internationally. See Note 7—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements.Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2015, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $9.3 billion of assets and $268 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $262 million had significant unobservable inputs, including the unamended Visa Europe put option liability of $255 million, and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2015. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. 46Table of Contents Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years Total (in millions)Purchase orders(1)$855 $196 $49 $— $1,100Leases(2)95 120 70 107 392Client incentives(3)3,917 5,668 3,792 4,067 17,444Marketing and sponsorship(4)112 242 229 71 654Dividends(5)341 — — — 341Total(6,7,8)$5,320 $6,226 $4,140 $4,245 $19,931(1) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. (2) Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to thirteen years. (3) Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to thirteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa-branded product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes expected dividend amount of $341 million as dividends were declared in October 2015 and will be paid on December 1, 2015 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 13, 2015. (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $752 million. At September 30, 2015, we had also accrued $33 million of interest and $6 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(7) On November 2, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire Visa Europe for a total purchase price of up to €21.2 billion to be paid in a combination of up-front cash, preferred stock, and contingent cash consideration due four years after closing. As the agreement was signed after the balance sheet date, and closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, the maximum potential purchase price is not included in the table above. Additionally, in conjunction with the agreement to acquire Visa Europe, we also entered into an option amendment, which amended the terms of the Visa Europe put option to align with the terms of the transaction agreement to acquire Visa Europe. If the acquisition does not close, the Visa Europe put option will revert to its original, unamended terms. Due to the perpetual nature of the unamended instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist if the unamended put were exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the current economic conditions and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its unamended option, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. The fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option itself totaling $255 million at September 30, 2015 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. 47Table of Contents(8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2015, client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues.Fair Value—Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. On November 2, 2015, the Visa Europe put option was amended in conjunction with our agreement to acquire Visa Europe. At September 30, 2015, the fair value of the put option liability was based on the unamended terms. If the acquisition of Visa Europe, described in Note 2—Visa Europe, is not completed, the put option will revert to its original, unamended form. If the put option is exercised under its unamended terms, we will be required to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The unamended put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the P/E ratio, at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted net income for the forward 12-month period (as defined in the unamended option agreement), or the adjusted sustainable income. 48Table of ContentsThe calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise of the unamended put option, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, would be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The unamended put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the unamended agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's unamended option was estimated to be approximately $255 million at September 30, 2015. While the unamended put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the unamended put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option in its unamended form. While this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015, it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the unamended terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $15 billion. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the unamended put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option in its unamended form, and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the unamended put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise—Exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, including under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended terms of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions (if any) to exercise the put option in its unamended form; (ii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iii) other qualitative factors including, but not limited to, qualitative factors related to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E differential—The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the unamended put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the “long-term P/E calculation”) and the last 30 trading dates (the “30-day P/E calculation”) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings 49Table of Contentsmultiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. Growth rates assumed in the valuation reflect a for-profit model, as we believe it is likely that, should Visa Europe choose to exercise the put option in its unamended form, it will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the unamended put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the unamended put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015, we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.5x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $37 million in the value of the unamended put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $249 million in the value of the unamended put option. The unamended put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2015. Classification in current liabilities reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months at September 30, 2015. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2015. See Note 3—U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Potential Visa Europe Liabilities and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by 50Table of Contentsthe taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskAlthough most of our activities are transacted in U.S. dollars, we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of payments in foreign currencies, primarily for expenses at our non-U.S. locations. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the U.S. dollar equivalent of anticipated non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2015 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately $91 million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2015. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2015 and 2014 were $4.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $48 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2015. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion at September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Visa Europe Put OptionWe have a liability related to the put option with Visa Europe, which is recorded at fair value at September 30, 2015 based on its unamended terms. We are required to assess the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as necessary. In the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at September 30, 2015, we assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and a P/E differential, at the time of exercise, of approximately 1.5x. The use of a probability of exercise 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $37 million in the value of the unamended put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $249 51Table of Contentsmillion in the value of the unamended put option. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates above. Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $1.0 billion and $983 million, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $248 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $30 million in pension cost. We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2016, if any, which would be made in September 2016. 52Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:12.915108
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2016,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” ""us,"" “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We enable global commerce through the transfer of value and information among these participants. Our advanced transaction processing network facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services.Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2016 reflects the impacts of continued uneven and tepid economic growth.Visa Europe acquisition. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. The purchase price consisted of: (a) at the closing of the transaction (Closing), up-front cash consideration of €12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into class A common stock or class A equivalent preferred stock, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016, and (b) following the third anniversary of the Closing, an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest. The preferred stock conversion rates may be reduced from time to time to offset certain liabilities, if any, which may be incurred by us, Visa Europe or its affiliates as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory before the Closing. As part of the acquisition, we also entered into the U.K. loss sharing agreement with Visa Europe and certain of Visa Europe’s members located in the United Kingdom to compensate us for certain losses which may be incurred by us or Visa Europe as a result of certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting and implementation of domestic multilateral interchange fee rates in the United Kingdom before the Closing. Our consolidated balance sheets reflect the consolidation of Visa Europe as of September 30, 2016. We did not include Visa Europe's financial results in our consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Our consolidated statements of operations include the financial results of Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe, Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Debt issuance. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on these notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14, commencing June 14, 2016. The net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were used to fund the upfront cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Visa Europe and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.Financial highlights. Our financial results for fiscal 2016 include the impact of several significant one-time items. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below. 30Table of Contents Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, % Change(1) 2016 2015 2014 2016vs.2015 2015vs.2014 (in millions, except percentages)Net income, as reported$5,991 $6,328 $5,438 (5)% 16%Diluted earnings per share, as reported(2)$2.48 $2.58 $2.16 (4)% 20% Net income, as adjusted(3)$6,862 $6,438 $5,721 7 % 13%Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted(2),(3)$2.84 $2.62 $2.27 8 % 16%(1) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the fiscal second quarter of 2015. (3) Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. We recorded net operating revenues of $15.1 billion for fiscal 2016, an increase of 9% over the prior year driven by continued growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of Visa Europe. The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our total operating growth.Total operating expenses for fiscal 2016 were $7.2 billion, compared to $4.8 billion in fiscal 2015. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction, combined with acquisition-related costs of approximately $152 million. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2015 we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. Our financial results for the year ended September 30, 2014 reflect a one-time tax benefit of $191 million associated with a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities related to prior fiscal years. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Severance cost. In the fiscal fourth quarter, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million. •Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. In September 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom. •Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of U.K. stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable 31Table of Contentsfederal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.•Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss. Upon consummation of the transaction, on June 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.•Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. See Note 12—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.•Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the Closing. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million.•Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a litigation provision of $450 million and related tax benefits of $167 million associated with the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be paid from the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 32Table of ContentsAdjusted operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating income, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014: Fiscal 2016(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Operating Expenses Operating Margin(1),(2) Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Taxes Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share(2)As reported$7,199 52% $129 $2,021 $5,991 $2.48Severance cost(110) 1% — 38 72 0.03Remeasurement of deferred tax liability— —% — 88 (88) (0.04)Acquisition-related costs(152) 1% — 56 96 0.04Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss(1,877) 12% — 693 1,184 0.49Net gains on currency forward contracts— —% (74) (27) (47) (0.02)Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits— —% (145) (54) (91) (0.04)Revaluation of Visa Europe put option— —% (255) — (255) (0.11)As adjusted$5,060 66% $(345) $2,815 $6,862 $2.84Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported 2,414 Fiscal 2015(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Operating Expenses Operating Margin(1),(2) Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Taxes Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share(2),(3)As reported$4,816 65% $(69) $2,667 $6,328 $2.58Revaluation of Visa Europe put option— —% 110 — 110 0.04As adjusted$4,816 65% $41 $2,667 $6,438 $2.62Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported 2,457 Fiscal 2014(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Operating Expenses Operating Margin(1),(2) Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Taxes Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share(2),(3)As reported$5,005 61% $27 $2,286 $5,438 $2.16Litigation provision(450) 4% — 167 283 0.11As adjusted$4,555 64% $27 $2,453 $5,721 $2.27Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, as reported 2,523(1) Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues.

During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 91 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $7.0 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2016, we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2015 have been completed. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. 33Table of ContentsNominal payments volume over the prior year posted strong growth in the U.S., driven mainly by consumer debit and credit. Nominal international payments volume was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016(1) and 2015 was 37% and 13%, respectively. Processed transactions sustained healthy growth reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. The following tables present nominal payments volume.(2) United States International Visa Inc. 12 months ended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 2016 2015 %Change 2016 2015 %Change 2016 2015 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,080 $980 10% $1,720 $1,676 3 % $2,799 $2,656 5 %Consumer debit(3)1,320 1,202 10% 454 462 (2)% 1,774 1,663 7 %Commercial(4)450 412 9% 147 150 (2)% 598 562 6 %Visa Europe(5) 479 NM 479 NMTotal nominal payments volume$2,851 $2,594 10% $2,800 $2,288 22 % $5,651 $4,882 16 %Cash volume520 491 6% 1,774 2,015 (12)% 2,294 2,506 (8)%Visa Europe(5) 175 NM 175 NMTotal nominal volume(6)$3,370 $3,086 9% $4,749 $4,303 10 % $8,119 $7,388 10 % United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 months ended June 30,(1) 2015 2014 %Change 2015 2014 %Change 2015 2014 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$980 $872 12% $1,676 $1,599 5 % $2,656 $2,470 8 %Consumer debit(3)1,202 1,127 7% 462 453 2 % 1,663 1,580 5 %Commercial(4)412 370 11% 150 145 4 % 562 514 9 %Total nominal payments volume$2,594 $2,369 10% $2,288 $2,196 4 % $4,882 $4,565 7 %Cash volume491 469 5% 2,015 2,122 (5)% 2,506 2,591 (3)%Total nominal volume(6)$3,086 $2,838 9% $4,303 $4,319 — % $7,388 $7,157 3 %The following table presents nominal and constant payments volume growth.(2) International Visa Inc. 12 months endedJune 30,2016 vs 2015(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2015 vs 2014(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2016 vs 2015(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2015 vs 2014(1) Nominal Constant(7) Nominal Constant(7) Nominal Constant(7) Nominal Constant(7)Total payments volume growth (5)22% 37% 4% 13% 16% 22% 7% 11%Total volume growth(5)10% 27% —% 10% 10% 19% 3% 10%(1) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 34Table of Contents(2) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

Our operating revenues and related processed transactions for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the financial results or related processed transactions of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact is immaterial. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.(2) As a result of changes in Russian National Payment System law, we transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian National Payment Card System during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after the transition.(3) Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe during the fiscal fourth quarter.Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. 35Table of ContentsData processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses mainly consist of transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition, product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Non-operating Income (Expense) Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations. 36Table of ContentsVisa Inc. Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the U.S., internationally and in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016.

(3) Reflects revenues earned from Visa Europe prior to the acquisition, in accordance with the Framework Agreement that provided for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume, as well as the fiscal fourth quarter operating revenues of Visa Europe. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth also reflects the positive impact of select pricing modifications effected in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2016, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in a negative three percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth.The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Other revenues also includes revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016.

The growth in fiscal 2016 service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. Fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications which became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.•Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 17% and 9%, respectively, which includes data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield. •International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 37%, including revenues earned by Visa Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter. In addition to the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our international transaction revenue yield, fiscal 2016 growth also reflects select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher volatility in a broad range of currencies, combined with select pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.•Client incentives increased in fiscal 2016 and 2015, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and Visa Europe's incentives for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Operating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses.

Operating expenses incurred by Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are reflected in fiscal 2016 total operating expenses.(3) Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 and 2014 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the Visa Europe acquisition, or are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Overview within this Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.•Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe, combined with an increase from the inclusion of Visa Europe fiscal fourth quarter expenses. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor 38Table of Contentscosts, an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth, combined with higher incentive compensation.•Marketing expenses in fiscal 2016 reflect efficiencies in production and agency costs which were redeployed for other marketing uses, and Visa Europe expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter. The decrease in marketing during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was mainly due to the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar as marketing spend in local currencies was converted to U.S. dollars, combined with the absence of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and 2014 FIFA World Cup spend that was incurred in fiscal 2014. The decrease was partially offset by increases in promotional campaigns that support our growth strategies and product initiatives.•Network and processing expenses increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the Russian National Payment Card system during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2015 was a result of initiatives to optimize the use of our technology resources. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.•Professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily reflecting transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Visa Europe. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.•Depreciation and amortization expenses in fiscal 2016 were flat compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.•General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2016 mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of Visa Europe and the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. The increase was also attributable to net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact. The increase in fiscal 2015 was mainly due to an increase in travel activities, product enhancements and facilities costs in support of our business growth, combined with losses incurred from the sale of assets held by an international subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains and the absence of the fiscal 2014 disposal of obsolete technology assets.•Litigation provision decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the absence of a loss incurred in fiscal 2015 upon the settlement of uncovered litigation. The decrease in fiscal 2015 reflects the absence of a $450 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation incurred in fiscal 2014. See Note 20—Legal Matters and Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans to our consolidated financial statements.•Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss resulted from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense).

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) Our non-operating income (expense) for fiscal 2016 does not reflect the financial results of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. Fiscal 2016 non-operating income (expense) includes financial results of Visa Europe for the three months ended September 30, 2016. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.•Interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the issuance of $16.0 billion fixed-rate senior notes in December 2015. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.•Other non-operating income (expense) in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following:•net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As these contracts are not designated in hedging relationships, related gains and losses are recorded directly in earnings as part of non-operating income (expense); •a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the Closing;•a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and•a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax.See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 12—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 25% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to:•the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate;•an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016;•the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and•the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years.The effective income tax rates were 30% in fiscal 2015 and 2014. The following highlights the significant tax items recorded in each respective year:•the aforementioned $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015; and•a $264 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2014 related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million was a one-time tax benefit related to prior fiscal years.Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for fiscal 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2016. See Overview - Adjusted financial results within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. 40Table of Contents Fiscal 2016 Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate(1) As reported$8,012 $2,021 25.2%Severance cost110 38 Remeasurement of deferred tax liability— 88 Acquisition-related costs152 56 Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss1,877 693 Net gains on currency forward contracts(74) (27) Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits(145) (54) Revaluation of Visa Europe put option(255) — As adjusted$9,677 $2,815 29.1%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$5,574 $6,584 $7,205Investing activities(10,916) (1,435) (941)Financing activities7,477 (3,603) (6,478)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(34) 1 (1)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$2,101 $1,547 $(215) 41Table of ContentsOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the Visa Europe acquisition and the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation, including:•$1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe, and payment of $244 million of interest on the senior notes during fiscal 2016 (see Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 9—Debt);•payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015; and•the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid.The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction. Cash used in investing activities was higher in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, primarily reflecting a decrease in the proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, and an increase in purchases of available-for-sale securities. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe and Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.Financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, $7.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market, and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 and 2014 reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, as follows:•payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2015;•$1.1 billion in takedown payments returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014; and•$450 million deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account in fiscal 2014.The remainder of the change in fiscal 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans, Note 9—Debt, Note 14—Stockholders' Equity and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $8.7 billion at September 30, 2016. If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the U.S., we would be required to pay U.S. income taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the U.S. As such, we have not accrued any U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $8.3 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these funds been repatriated is not practicably determinable.Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.9 billion, are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. 42Table of ContentsFactors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2016. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.Credit facility. On January 27, 2016, we entered into an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 27, 2021, replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which expired on January 27, 2016. The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2016. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018.Long-term debt and change in capital structure. In conjunction with the Visa Europe acquisition, we have evolved our long-term capital structure. In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Our first principal payment of $1.8 billion is due on December 14, 2017. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year. An interest payment of $244 million was made on June 14, 2016. The Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part, at our option at any time prior to maturity, at a specified redemption price. The net aggregate proceeds of $15.9 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of $127 million, were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Visa Europe and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance. See Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to issue additional debt of about $2.0 billion by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017, market conditions permitting.U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2016, was $1.0 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.Credit RatingsAt September 30, 2016, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Stable P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Stable A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 43Table of ContentsUses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2016, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $242 million.Visa Europe acquisition. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. We paid up-front cash consideration of €12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016. Also, in connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2016, we made $45 million in covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account, reflecting settlements with individual opt-out merchants in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceedings. At September 30, 2016, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.0 billion. In June 2016, the approval of the 2012 Settlement Agreement was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we will have the right to approximately $3.0 billion, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 91 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $7.0 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2016, we had remaining authorized funds of $5.8 billion. In October 2015 and July 2016, our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for $5.0 billion each. These authorizations have no expiration date. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2015 have been completed. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements.Dividends. During fiscal 2016, we declared and paid $1.4 billion in dividends. In October 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.165 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock and U.K.&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $400 million in connection with this dividend on December 6, 2016. See Note 14—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the U.S. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the U.K. pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe U.K. pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the U.K. pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans of $4 million, $19 million, and 44Table of Contents$14 million, respectively. For Visa Europe's U.K. pension plans, we made contributions of $102 million subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2017, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. and Visa Europe's U.K. defined benefit pension plans by approximately $12 million and $6 million, respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2016, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2016, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $12.0 billion of assets and $136 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2016. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. 45Table of Contents Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years Total (in millions)Long-term debt(1)$489 $2,696 $3,903 $16,501 $23,589Purchase orders(2)962 164 49 — 1,175Leases(3)126 185 118 190 619Client incentives(4)5,544 6,745 4,721 4,791 21,801Marketing and sponsorship(5)126 248 148 33 555Dividends(6)400 — — — 400Deferred purchase consideration(7)— 1,266 — — 1,266Total(8,9)$7,647 $11,304 $8,939 $21,515 $49,405(1) In December 2015, we issued $16.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in conjunction with the acquisition of Visa Europe with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Interest on the Notes, at a rate ranging between 1.20% and 4.30%, is payable semi-annually on June 14 and December 14 of each year. Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 9—Debt to our consolidated financial statements.(2) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.(3) Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to nineteen years.(4) Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record.(5) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.(6) Includes expected dividend amount of $400 million as dividends were declared in October 2016 and will be paid on December 6, 2016 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 18, 2016.(7) On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the Closing. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.(8) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $911 million. At September 30, 2016, we had also accrued $61 million of interest and $17 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(9) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 46Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2016, client incentives represented 18% of gross operating revenues.Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2016. Our Europe 47Table of Contentsretrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $2.7 billion and $1.2 billion at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2016 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $160 million or loss of approximately $190 million, respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2016. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. On the third anniversary of the Closing, we will pay additional purchase consideration of €1 billion, plus 4.0% compound annual interest. See Note 2—Acquisition of Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro. A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2016, would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $123 million, including interest. 48Table of ContentsWe are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2016, could result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $1.9 billion. In the third quarter, we designated our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of our net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company's net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $5.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $49 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2016. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $254 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $40 million in pension cost.At September 30, 2016, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $415 million and projected benefit obligations were $474 million. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $127 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $9 million in pension cost.We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2017, if any, which would be made in September 2017. 49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:13.121728
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2017,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” ""us,"" “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services.Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2017 reflects continued uneven economic growth around the world.Legal entity reorganization. In February 2017, we completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. As a result of the reorganization, during fiscal 2017, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe, which were previously recorded as treasury stock.Debt issuance. In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. Subsequent to our fiscal year-end, in October 2017, we used the majority of the proceeds from this new debt to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes that was scheduled to mature in December 2017. See Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Financial highlights. Our financial results for fiscal 2017 include the impact of several significant one-time items. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below. Fiscal Year EndedSeptember 30, % Change(1) 2017 2016 2015 2017vs.2016 2016vs.2015 (in millions, except percentages)Net income, as reported$6,699 $5,991 $6,328 12% (5)%Diluted earnings per share, as reported(2)$2.80 $2.48 $2.58 13% (4)% Net income, as adjusted(3)$8,335 $6,862 $6,438 21% 7 %Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted(2),(3)$3.48 $2.84 $2.62 22% 8 %(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. (3) Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. We recorded net operating revenues of $18.4 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of 22% over the prior year primarily reflecting the operating revenues of Visa Europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume. The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately negative one and a half percentage point impact to our total operating growth. 33Table of ContentsTotal operating expenses for fiscal 2017 were $6.2 billion, compared to $7.2 billion in fiscal 2016. The decrease over the prior year was primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss in fiscal 2016 resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe upon consummation of the transaction, offset by the inclusion of Visa Europe's operating expenses following the acquisition.During fiscal 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $296 million resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Of the $296 million benefit, $239 million relates to prior fiscal years. See Note 18—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Elimination of deferred tax balances. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.•Charitable contribution. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-recurring, non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.•Severance cost. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million. •Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. In September 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom. •Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. •Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss. Upon consummation of the transaction, on June 21, 2016, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. •Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. •Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million. 34Table of Contents•Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a decrease of $255 million and an increase of $110 million, respectively, in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income and expense in other non-operating income. These amounts are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision. Adjusted operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating (expense) income, income taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015: Fiscal 2017(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Operating Expenses Operating Margin(1),(2) Non-operating (Expense)Income Income Taxes Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share(2)As reported$6,214 66% $(450) $4,995 $6,699 $2.80Elimination of deferred tax balances— —% — (1,515) 1,515 0.63Charitable contribution(192) 1% — 71 121 0.05As adjusted$6,022 67% $(450) $3,551 $8,335 $3.48 Fiscal 2016(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Operating Expenses Operating Margin(1),(2) Non-operating (Expense)Income Income Taxes Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share(2)As reported$7,199 52% $129 $2,021 $5,991 $2.48Severance cost(110) 1% — 38 72 0.03Remeasurement of deferred tax liability— —% — 88 (88) (0.04)Acquisition-related costs(152) 1% — 56 96 0.04Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss(1,877) 12% — 693 1,184 0.49Net gains on currency forward contracts— —% (74) (27) (47) (0.02)Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits— —% (145) (54) (91) (0.04)Revaluation of Visa Europe put option— —% (255) — (255) (0.11)As adjusted$5,060 66% $(345) $2,815 $6,862 $2.84 Fiscal 2015(in millions, except percentages and per share data)Operating Expenses Operating Margin(1),(2) Non-operating (Expense)Income Income Taxes Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share(2),(3)As reported$4,816 65% $(69) $2,667 $6,328 $2.58Revaluation of Visa Europe put option— —% 110 — 110 0.04As adjusted$4,816 65% $41 $2,667 $6,438 $2.62(1) Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues.

(3) The per share amounts for the prior periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 77 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $6.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2017, we had remaining authorized funds of $3.9 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to April 2017 have been completed. See Note 13—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 35Table of ContentsNominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted double-digit growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit. Nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted due to the inclusion of nominal payments volume related to Visa Europe for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017(1). Growth on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, on our international payments volume was not significantly different from growth on a nominal-dollar basis for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017(1) and was 13% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016(1). Growth in processed transactions reflects the inclusion of Visa Europe's processed transactions for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017 and three months ended September 30, 2016.The following tables present nominal payments volume.(2) United States International Visa Inc. 12 months ended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 2017 2016 %Change 2017 2016 %Change 2017 2016 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,309 $1,079 21% $2,224 $1,720 29% $3,533 $2,799 26%Consumer debit(3)1,372 1,320 4% 1,545 454 241% 2,917 1,774 64%Commercial(4)506 450 12% 309 147 110% 815 598 36%Total nominal payments volume(5)$3,187 $2,849 12% $4,078 $2,321 76% $7,265 $5,170 41%Cash volume543 520 5% 2,357 1,775 33% 2,900 2,294 26%Total nominal volume(5),(6)$3,730 $3,369 11% $6,435 $4,095 57% $10,165 $7,464 36% United States International Visa Inc. 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 months ended June 30,(1) 2016 2015 %Change 2016 2015 %Change 2016 2015 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,079 $980 10% $1,720 $1,676 3 % $2,799 $2,656 5 %Consumer debit(3)1,320 1,201 10% 454 462 (2)% 1,774 1,663 7 %Commercial(4)450 412 9% 147 150 (2)% 598 562 6 %Total nominal payments volume(5)$2,849 $2,594 10% $2,321 $2,288 1 % $5,170 $4,882 6 %Cash volume520 491 6% 1,775 2,015 (12)% 2,294 2,506 (8)%Total nominal volume(5),(6)$3,369 $3,085 9% $4,095 $4,303 (5)% $7,464 $7,388 1 % 36Table of ContentsThe following table presents nominal and constant payments volume growth.(2) International Visa Inc. 12 months endedJune 30,2017 vs 2016(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2016 vs 2015(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2017 vs 2016(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2016 vs 2015(1) Nominal Constant(7) Nominal Constant(7) Nominal Constant(7) Nominal Constant(7)Payments volume growth Consumer credit29% 30% 3 % 13% 26% 27% 5 % 12%Consumer debit(3)241% 238% (2)% 15% 64% 64% 7 % 11%Commercial(4)110% 105% (2)% 12% 36% 36% 6 % 10%Total payments volume growth(5)76% 76% 1 % 13% 41% 41% 6 % 11%Cash volume growth33% 33% (12)% 4% 26% 26% (8)% 4%Total volume growth(5)57% 57% (5)% 9% 36% 36% 1 % 9%(1) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.(2) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume.(4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5) Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 does not reflect the related nominal payments volume of $477 billion and cash volume of $177 billion for Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.(6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks.

Our operating revenues and related processed transactions for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the financial results or related processed transactions of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.(2) Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2017 and fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe.(3) As a result of changes in Russian National Payment System law, we transitioned the processing of Russian domestic transactions to the Russian NSPK during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The number of transactions processed by the Visa network does not reflect Russian domestic transactions processed after this transition.Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. 37Table of ContentsThe following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities, and with respect to fiscal 2016 and 2015, revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses mainly consist of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business, and with respect to fiscal 2016, transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Non-operating (Expense) IncomeNon-operating (expense) income primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations, and with respect to fiscal 2016 and 2015, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income. 38Table of ContentsVisa Inc.

(3) Reflects revenues earned from Visa Europe prior to the acquisition, in accordance with the Framework Agreement that provided for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. The increase in operating revenues primarily reflects the operating revenues of Visa Europe and continued growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2017, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately negative one and a half percentage point impact to our net operating revenue growth.The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Other revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015 also included revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016.

(2) Our operating revenues for fiscal 2016 do not reflect revenues earned by Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. •Service revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily due to 41% and 6% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 growth also reflected select pricing modifications. 39Table of Contents•Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 34% and 17%, respectively. The growth in data processing revenues was slower than the growth in processed transactions, reflecting the inclusion of data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield. •International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 79% and 37%, respectively, which includes revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our corresponding yield. International transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and 2016 also reflected select pricing modifications, which was partially offset in fiscal 2017 by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. •Client incentives increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2017 and 2016 and the inclusion of Visa Europe's incentives for fiscal 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Operating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses.

(3) Operating expenses for fiscal 2017 and 2016 include significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our operating performance as they are related to the charitable donation or the Visa Europe acquisition. See Overview within this Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Total operating expenses decreased primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe recorded during fiscal 2016. The remaining components of total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses. Additional factors impacting our operating expenses are discussed below.•Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2017 driven by higher incentive compensation, combined with continued increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. The increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a severance charge related to personnel reductions including planned reductions at Visa Europe. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in contractor costs, an increase in personnel costs that were invested in and capitalized as part of technology development projects and lower incentive compensation. •Network and processing expenses increased in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions that transitioned to the Russian NSPK during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. •Professional fees increased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to transaction costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. 40Table of Contents•Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.•General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to $192 million of expense related to the Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were received by the newly-formed Visa Foundation, as well as an increase in expense to provide product benefits to our account holders as a result of business growth. The increase in 2016 was mainly due to costs incurred related to our acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016 as well as net foreign exchange losses incurred as a result of changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate against other currencies in which we transact.

See Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Other non-operating (expense) income in fiscal 2016 and 2015 was primarily comprised of the following:▪net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition; ▪a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition;▪a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero; and▪a non-cash adjustment of $110 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to increase the fair value of the unamended Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax.See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 11—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Effective Income Tax Rate In February 2017, to align our corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, we completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and certain other legal entities. As a result of the reorganization, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe. Associated with this reorganization, the newly-formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc. shares held by Visa Europe that were previously recorded as treasury stock. 41Table of ContentsThe effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to:•the aforementioned $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision related to the legal entity reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017;•$71 million tax benefit related to Visa Foundation's receipt of Visa Inc. shares mentioned above, recorded in fiscal 2017;•$70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report; and•the absence of:▪the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; ▪an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and▪the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016.The effective income tax rate was 25% in fiscal 2016 and 30% in fiscal 2015. The effective rate in fiscal 2016 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 primarily due to:•the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition, as mentioned above, that impacted the geographic mix of global income resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016;•an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016;•the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016; and•the absence of a $296 million tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2015 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions with taxing authorities. Included in the $296 million was a one-time $239 million tax benefit that related to prior fiscal years.Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for fiscal 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate in the tables below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2017 and 2016. See Overview—Adjusted financial results within this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below.

Effective income tax rate changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$9,208 $5,574 $6,584Investing activities735 (10,916) (1,435)Financing activities(5,924) 7,477 (3,603)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents236 (34) 1Increase in cash and cash equivalents$4,255 $2,101 $1,547 43Table of ContentsOperating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of Visa Europe in our results for the full year, while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included Visa Europe. Other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include:•$1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition during fiscal 2016 related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe;•payments of $489 million and $244 million of interest on the outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively; and•payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account and a related decrease of approximately $157 million of income taxes paid during fiscal 2015.The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 reflected net proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction in fiscal 2016. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected net purchases of available-for-sale securities.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $6.9 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.6 billion of dividend payments, partially offset by $2.5 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in September 2017. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, partially offset by $7.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected payments of $426 million made from the U.S. litigation escrow account in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above within operating activities, as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans, Note 8—Debt, Note 13—Stockholders' Equity and Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries, primarily attributable to undistributed earnings, totaled $6.9 billion at September 30, 2017. Following our legal entity reorganization in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we returned net $5.0 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States in fiscal 2017. This transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and was not subject to U.S. income taxes. If it were necessary to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. income taxes on the repatriated earnings. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of the undistributed earnings outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued any U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $12.9 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had these undistributed earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.5 billion, are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date, however, are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. 44Table of ContentsFactors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2017. See Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit facility. On January 27, 2016, we entered into an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. On January 27, 2017, we extended the term of the credit facility, which will now expire on January 27, 2022. There were no borrowings under the credit facility as of September 30, 2017 and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended September 30, 2017. See Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2015, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2018.Long-term debt. In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. We also issued in December 2015 fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. Subsequent to our fiscal year-end, in October 2017, we used the majority of the proceeds from the September 2017 debt issuance to redeem the $1.75 billion of senior notes that was scheduled to mature in December 2017. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of these debt issuances. See Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2017, was $1.0 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.Credit RatingsAt September 30, 2017, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Stable P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Stable A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 45Table of ContentsUses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2017, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $426 million. We hold about $7 billion of available liquidity, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle.U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2017, we made no covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2017, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.0 billion. In June 2016, the approval of the 2012 Settlement Agreement was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Until the appeals process is complete, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims as contemplated by the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation account into settlement funds pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, we will have the right to approximately $3.0 billion, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid by approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 77 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $6.9 billion of cash on hand. As of September 30, 2017, we had remaining authorized funds of $3.9 billion. In April 2017 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $5.0 billion. This authorization has no expiration date. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to April 2017 have been completed. See Note 13—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Dividends. During fiscal 2017, we declared and paid $1.6 billion in dividends. In October 2017, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.195 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $459 million in connection with this dividend on December 5, 2017. See Note 13—Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe's defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $12 million, $4 million and $19 million, respectively. For Visa Europe's UK pension plans, we made contributions of $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2018, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe's UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $5 million, respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, 46Table of Contentsmovements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 9—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2017, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received. The acquisition will help Visa's clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe, a payments technology business. The acquisition positions us to create additional value through increased scale, efficiencies realized by the integration of both businesses, and benefits related to Visa Europe's transition from an association to a for-profit enterprise. We paid up-front cash consideration of €12.2 billion ($13.9 billion) and issued preferred stock convertible upon certain conditions into approximately 79 million shares of class A common stock, equivalent to a value of €5.3 billion ($6.1 billion) at the closing stock price of $77.33 on June 21, 2016. Also, in connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition. See Note 2—Visa Europe and Note 6—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2017, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $14.3 billion of assets and $98 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 4—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2017. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. 47Table of Contents Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years Total (in millions)Long-term debt(1)$2,298 $1,074 $4,974 $18,386 $26,732Purchase orders(2)827 124 26 2 979Leases(3)155 187 121 163 626Client incentives(4)6,306 8,475 6,663 5,344 26,788Marketing and sponsorship(5)124 235 73 — 432Dividends(6)459 — — — 459Deferred purchase consideration(7)— 1,331 — — 1,331Total(8),(9)$10,169 $11,426 $11,857 $23,895 $57,347(1) Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 8—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. (2) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.(3) Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years.(4) Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners is unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to sixteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. These payment amounts are our best estimates and will likely change materially based on actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements, which are also estimates that will likely change materially due to the same factors described above.(5) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.(6) Includes expected dividend amount of $459 million as dividends were declared in October 2017 and will be paid on December 5, 2017 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 17, 2017.(7) On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2017 exchange rate. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.(8) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.1 billion. At September 30, 2017, we had also accrued $84 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(9) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 9—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives 48Table of ContentsCritical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2017, client incentives represented 20% of gross operating revenues.Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. We did not record an accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2017. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 3—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 19—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 49Table of ContentsIncome Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and adverse changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2017 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $210 million or loss of approximately $250 million, respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2017. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. On the third anniversary of the Closing, we will pay additional purchase consideration of €1 billion, plus 4.0% compounded annual interest. See Note 2—Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro. A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2017, would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $130 million, including interest. 50Table of ContentsWe are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2017, would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2 billion. We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company's net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2017 and 2016 were $6.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $29 million on our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2017. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2017 and 2016, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $241 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $44 million in pension cost.At September 30, 2017 and 2016, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $433 million and $415 million, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $433 million and $474 million, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $157 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $11 million in pension cost.We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2018, if any, which would be made in September 2018. 51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:13.632815
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2018,"ITEM 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThis management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services.U.S. Tax Reform Legislation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date and the remeasurement resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion and was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018. In transitioning to the new territorial system, the Tax Act requires us to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income. This tax, referred to as the “transition tax”, was estimated to be $1.1 billion and was recorded in the year ended September 30, 2018. See Note 16—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Financial overview. Our financial results for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 include the impact of several significant one-time items. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are shown in the table below. For the Years EndedSeptember 30, % Change(1) 2018 2017 2016 2018vs.2017 2017vs.2016 (in millions, except percentages)Net income, as reported$10,301 $6,699 $5,991 54% 12%Diluted earnings per share, as reported$4.42 $2.80 $2.48 58% 13% Net income, as adjusted(2)$10,729 $8,335 $6,862 29% 21%Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted(2)$4.61 $3.48 $2.84 32% 22%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2) Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 exclude the impact of certain significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. Highlights for fiscal 2018. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2018 reflects solid global consumer spending growth, supported by favorable U.S. economic conditions and tempered by volatility in some emerging markets. We recorded net operating revenues of $20.6 billion for fiscal 2018, an increase of 12% over the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in processed transactions, nominal payments volume and nominal cross-border volume. The effect of exchange rate movements, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive impact to our net operating revenue growth.Total operating expenses for fiscal 2018 were $7.7 billion, compared to $6.2 billion in fiscal 2017. The increase over the prior year was primarily driven by a higher litigation provision and continued investments to support our business growth. 33Table of ContentsAdjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in the prior or future years, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented.•Charitable contributions ▪During fiscal 2018, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million, before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income decreased by $49 million.▪During fiscal 2017, associated with our legal entity reorganization, we recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $192 million, before tax, related to the charitable donation of Visa Inc. shares that were acquired as part of the Visa Europe acquisition and held as treasury stock. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $71 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, adjusted net income increased by $121 million.•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $600 million and related tax benefits of $137 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock.•Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion.•Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act’s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion. •Elimination of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2017, in connection with our legal entity reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision of $1.5 billion.•Severance cost. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $110 million charge for severance costs related to personnel reductions, including planned reductions at Visa Europe. Although we routinely record severance expenses, these charges are larger than any past quarterly accrual due to the acquisition and integration of Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $38 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $72 million.•Remeasurement of deferred tax liability. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-cash, non-recurring $88 million gain upon the remeasurement of a deferred tax liability, recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe, to reflect a tax rate change in the United Kingdom. •Acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2016, we incurred $152 million of non-recurring acquisition costs in operating expense as a result of the Visa Europe transaction. This amount is comprised of $60 million of transaction expenses recorded in professional fees, and $92 million of UK stamp duty recorded in general and administrative expenses. Net of related tax benefit of $56 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $96 million. •Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss. During fiscal 2016, upon consummation of the Visa Europe transaction, we recorded a non-recurring loss of $1.9 billion, before tax, in operating expense resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Net of related tax benefit of $693 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was an increase of $1.2 billion. 34Table of Contents•Net gains on currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2016, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition. As a result, we recorded non-recurring, net gains of $74 million, before tax, in other non-operating income. Net of related tax expense of $27 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the adjustment to net income was a decrease of $47 million. •Foreign exchange gain on euro deposits. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a non-recurring foreign exchange gain of $145 million, before tax, in other non-operating income as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Net of related tax expense of $54 million, determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates, the impact to net income was a decrease of $91 million.•Revaluation of Visa Europe put option. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a decrease of $255 million in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, resulting in the recognition of non-cash income in other non-operating income. This amount is not subject to income tax and therefore has no impact on our reported income tax provision. Adjusted operating expenses, operating margin, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Interchange multidistrict litigation. During fiscal 2018, we recorded an additional accrual of $600 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to U.S. covered litigation of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2018. We also deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2018, total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 63 million shares at an average price of $124.29 per share. Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of operating cash on hand. Additionally, in June 2018, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Also, we recovered $56 million of VE territory covered losses in accordance with the Europe retrospective responsibility plan during fiscal 2018. The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because they reduce the class B common stock conversion rate and the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduce the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In January 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $7.5 billion share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2018, the program had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 36Table of ContentsNominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume over the prior year posted low double-digit growth in the United States, driven mainly by consumer credit and debit. Nominal international payments volume growth was positively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate was 11% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018. Growth on a constant-dollar basis was not significantly different from the nominal-dollar basis growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017(1). Growth in processed transactions for fiscal 2017 reflects the inclusion of Visa Europe’s processed transactions for the full year compared to three months in fiscal 2016.The following tables(2) present nominal payments and cash volume: United States International(7) Visa Inc.(7) 12 months ended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 2018 2017 %Change 2018 2017 %Change 2018 2017 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,441 $1,309 10% $2,443 $2,177 12% $3,885 $3,486 11%Consumer debit(3)1,496 1,373 9% 1,757 1,491 18% 3,253 2,864 14%Commercial(4)562 506 11% 363 306 19% 925 812 14%Total nominal payments volume$3,499 $3,188 10% $4,562 $3,974 15% $8,063 $7,162 13%Cash volume562 544 3% 2,435 2,348 4% 2,997 2,892 4%Total nominal volume(6)$4,061 $3,732 9% $6,998 $6,322 11% $11,060 $10,054 10% United States International(7) Visa Inc.(7) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 monthsended June 30,(1) 12 months ended June 30,(1) 2017 2016 %Change 2017 2016 %Change 2017 2016 %Change (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,309 $1,079 21% $2,177 $1,720 27% $3,486 $2,799 25%Consumer debit(3)1,373 1,320 4% 1,491 454 229% 2,864 1,774 61%Commercial(4)506 450 12% 306 148 107% 812 598 36%Total nominal payments volume(5)$3,188 $2,850 12% $3,974 $2,321 71% $7,162 $5,171 39%Cash volume544 520 5% 2,348 1,775 32% 2,892 2,294 26%Total nominal volume(5),(6)$3,732 $3,369 11% $6,322 $4,096 54% $10,054 $7,465 35%The following table presents nominal and constant payments and cash volume growth.(2) International(7) Visa Inc.(7) 12 months endedJune 30,2018 vs 2017(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2017 vs 2016(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2018 vs 2017(1) 12 months endedJune 30,2017 vs 2016(1) Nominal Constant(8) Nominal Constant(8) Nominal Constant(8) Nominal Constant(8)Payments volume growth Consumer credit12% 9% 27% 27% 11% 10% 25% 25%Consumer debit(3)18% 12% 229% 241% 14% 11% 61% 65%Commercial(4)19% 15% 107% 105% 14% 12% 36% 36%Total payments volume growth(5)15% 11% 71% 74% 13% 10% 39% 40%Cash volume growth4% 2% 32% 33% 4% 2% 26% 27%Total volume growth(5)11% 7% 54% 57% 10% 8% 35% 36% 37Table of Contents(1) Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.(2) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume.(4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5) Our nominal payments volume, total payments volume growth and total volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 does not reflect the related nominal payments volume of $477 billion and cash volume of $177 billion for Visa Europe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, which impacts our service revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.(6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (7) As a result of European Union Interchange Fee regulation changes, effective with the quarter ended December 31, 2016, Europe co-badged payments volume is no longer included in reported volume. For comparative purposes, prior year figures were adjusted to exclude co-badged volume. The associated growth rates for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were calculated using these adjusted amounts.(8) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.The following table(1),(2) provides the number of transactions involving Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, VPAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the fiscal periods presented: 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017% Change 2017 vs. 2016% Change (in millions, except percentages)Visa processed transactions124,320 111,215 83,159 12% 34%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. Our operating revenues and related processed transactions for fiscal 2016 do not reflect the financial results or related processed transactions of Visa Europe from the acquisition date, June 21, 2016, through June 30, 2016 as the impact was immaterial. (2) Visa processed transactions in fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 include transactions processed by Visa Europe.Financial Information PresentationOperating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered.International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume.Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, certification and licensing, and other activities related to our acquired entities. With respect to fiscal 2016, other revenues also consists of revenues earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement prior to the completion of the Visa Europe acquisition. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. 38Table of ContentsClient incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses mainly consist of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business, and with respect to fiscal 2016, transaction costs related to the Visa Europe acquisition. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.Visa Europe Framework Agreement loss is a one-time loss incurred upon consummation of the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016, resulting from the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe. Non-operating Income (Expense)Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments and derivative instruments not associated with our core operations, and with respect to fiscal 2016, changes in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option and income. 39Table of ContentsResults of Operations Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to the Visa Europe acquisition on June 21, 2016. Visa Europe revenue earned for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 is included in International.

(3) Reflects revenues earned from Visa Europe prior to the acquisition, in accordance with the Framework Agreement that provided for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. The Framework Agreement was effectively settled upon the closing of the acquisition. The increase in operating revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume, and processed transactions. The increase in operating revenues in fiscal 2017 also reflects the inclusion of operating revenues from Visa Europe for the full year compared to one quarter in fiscal 2016. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives in both fiscal 2018 and 2017. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues, international transaction revenues, and client incentives, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2018, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an approximately one percentage point positive impact to our net operating revenue growth.The following table sets forth the components of our net operating revenues, including operating revenues earned by Visa Europe for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Other revenues in fiscal 2016 included revenue earned from Visa Europe in accordance with the Framework Agreement prior to its acquisition on June 21, 2016.

The growth in service revenues was slower than the growth in payments volume during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of Visa Europe revenue and the resulting impact on our service revenue yield. •Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 12% and 34%, respectively. Fiscal 2018 growth also reflected select pricing modifications. The growth in data processing revenues was slower than the growth in processed transactions during fiscal 2017, reflecting the inclusion of data processing revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our data processing revenue yield.•International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 primarily due to nominal cross-border volume growth of 14% and 79%, respectively, and select pricing modifications. International transaction revenue growth in fiscal 2017 also reflects the inclusion of revenues earned by Visa Europe and the resulting impact on our corresponding yield, which was partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. •Client incentives increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017, reflecting overall growth in global payments volume, incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2018 and 2017 and the inclusion of Visa Europe’s incentives for fiscal 2018, 2017 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Operating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses: For the Years EndedSeptember 30, $ Change % Change(1) 2018 2017 2016(2) 2018vs.2017 2017vs.2016 2018vs.2017 2017vs.2016 (in millions, except percentages)Personnel$3,170 $2,628 $2,226 $542 $402 21% 18 %Marketing988 922 869 66 53 7% 6 %Network and processing686 620 538 66 82 11% 15 %Professional fees446 409 389 37 20 9% 5 %Depreciation and amortization613 556 502 57 54 10% 11 %General and administrative1,145 1,060 796 85 264 8% 33 %Litigation provision607 19 2 588 17 NM NMVisa Europe Framework Agreement loss— — 1,877 — (1,877) NM (100)%Total operating expenses(3)$7,655 $6,214 $7,199 $1,441 $(985) 23% (14)%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Overview within this Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the $600 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation and our ongoing investments to support our business growth. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for more information on the U.S. covered litigation accrual. Total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the $1.9 billion loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe recorded during fiscal 2016. The remaining components of total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of Visa Europe expenses. Additional factors impacting our operating expenses are discussed below.•Personnel expenses increased in fiscal 2018 and 2017 driven by continued increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. 41Table of Contents•Marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher spending in support of a number of campaigns, including the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 and 2018 FIFA World CupTM.Non-operating Income (Expense)The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense).

See Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Other non-operating income (expense) increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to gains of $292 million from the donation of securities to the Visa Foundation and sales of investments. Other non-operating income (expense) decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the absence of the following:▪net gains of $74 million in fiscal 2016 related to currency forward contracts entered into to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition; ▪a foreign exchange gain of $145 million in fiscal 2016 on euro deposits as a result of holding euro-denominated bank balances for a short period in advance of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition; and▪a non-cash adjustment of $255 million in fiscal 2016 to decrease the fair value of the Visa Europe put option, which is not subject to tax, reducing the fair value of the liability to zero. See Note 3—Fair Value Measurements and Investments and Note 9—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 20% in fiscal 2018 and 43% in fiscal 2017. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 primarily due to:•the effects of the Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below;•$161 million of tax benefits due to various non-recurring audit settlements in fiscal 2018; and•the absence of the following items related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017:▪a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision primarily related to the elimination of deferred tax balances originally recognized upon the acquisition of Visa Europe; and▪a $71 million one-time tax benefit related to the Visa Foundation’s receipt of Visa Inc. shares, previously recorded by Visa Europe as treasury stock. 42Table of ContentsThe effective income tax rate was 43% in fiscal 2017 and 25% in fiscal 2016. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 primarily due to:•the items listed above related to the Visa Europe reorganization recorded in fiscal 2017;•$70 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments recorded in fiscal 2017, as a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09; and•the absence of:▪the effect of one-time items related to the Visa Europe acquisition recorded during fiscal 2016, the most significant of which was the $1.9 billion U.S. loss related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between Visa and Visa Europe. These one-time items impacted the geographic mix of our global income, resulting in a reduced effective tax rate in fiscal 2016; ▪an $88 million one-time tax benefit due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the UK tax rate enacted in fiscal 2016; and▪the non-taxable $255 million revaluation of the Visa Europe put option recorded in fiscal 2016.The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, transitions the U.S. tax system to a new territorial system and lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate rate is a blended rate of 24.5%, which will be reduced to 21% in fiscal 2019 and thereafter. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we provisionally remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date of the Tax Act. The deferred tax remeasurement is now complete and resulted in a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of $1.1 billion, recorded in fiscal 2018.In transitioning to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act requires that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income. Such foreign earnings are subject to a one-time tax at 15.5% on the amount held in cash or cash equivalents, and at 8% on the remaining non-cash amount. The 15.5% and 8% tax, collectively referred to as the “transition tax”, was estimated to be $1.1 billion, and was recorded in fiscal 2018. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act.The above-mentioned accounting impact of the transition tax is provisional, based on currently available information and technical guidance on the interpretations of the new law. We continue to obtain and analyze additional information and guidance as they become available to complete the accounting for the tax impact of the Tax Act. Additional information currently unavailable that is needed to complete the analysis includes, but is not limited to, foreign tax returns and foreign tax documentation for the computation of foreign tax credits, and the final determination of the untaxed foreign earnings subject to the transition tax. The provisional accounting impact may change until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019, as permitted by ASU 2018-05.Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for fiscal 2018 and 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance in prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring or have no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rates in the tables below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance in fiscal 2018 and 2017. See Overview—Adjusted financial results within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. 43Table of Contents Year ended September 30, 2018 Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate(1) (in millions, except percentages)As reported$12,806 $2,505 19.6%Charitable contribution2 51 Litigation provision600 137 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances— 1,133 Transition tax on foreign earnings— (1,147) As adjusted$13,408 $2,679 20.0% Year ended September 30, 2017 Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate(1) (in millions, except percentages)As reported$11,694 $4,995 42.7%Charitable contribution192 71 Elimination of deferred tax balances— (1,515) As adjusted$11,886 $3,551 29.9%(1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 44Table of ContentsCash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: For the Years EndedSeptember 30, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$12,713 $9,208 $5,574Investing activities(3,084) 735 (10,916)Financing activities(11,240) (5,924) 7,477Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(101) 236 (34)(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(1,712) $4,255 $2,101Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 and 2017 was impacted by continued growth in our underlying business. Fiscal 2017 was impacted by the inclusion of Visa Europe in our results for the full year, while fiscal 2016 had one quarter of results that included Visa Europe. Other factors impacting cash provided by operating activities include:•net deposits made into the U.S. litigation escrow account of $450 million in fiscal 2018; •$1.9 billion of the consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition during fiscal 2016 related to the effective settlement of the Framework Agreement between us and Visa Europe; and•payments of $545 million, $489 million and $244 million of interest on the outstanding senior notes during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively.The cash inflows and outflows related to the U.S. litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 was higher than the prior-year comparable period as purchases of available-for-sale investment securities reflected additional investment of net proceeds received from new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 reflected net proceeds from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the up-front cash consideration paid in the Visa Europe acquisition, offset by $2.8 billion of cash held by Visa Europe at the closing of the transaction in fiscal 2016. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018 primarily reflected the $7.2 billion used to repurchase class A common stock, $1.9 billion of dividend payments, the redemption of $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes and $600 million deposited into the U.S. litigation escrow account, partially offset by payments of $150 million from our litigation escrow account. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $6.9 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.6 billion of dividend payments, partially offset by $2.5 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in September 2017. Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 primarily reflected $15.9 billion net aggregate proceeds received from our debt issuance completed in December 2015, partially offset by $7.0 billion used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market and $1.4 billion of dividend payments. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans, Note 6—Debt, Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. 45Table of ContentsForeign Earnings. Pursuant to the Tax Act, we are required to pay U.S. tax on most of the undistributed and untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries accumulated as of December 31, 2017. The transition tax will be paid over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act. As a result of the Tax Act, we are no longer subject to incremental U.S. federal tax on foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in the event that we repatriate these earnings back to the United States.Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.4 billion, are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2018. See Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit facility. We have an unsecured $4.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires on January 27, 2022. There were no borrowings under the credit facility as of September 30, 2018 and we were in compliance with all related covenants as of and during the year ended September 30, 2018. See Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2018, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2021.U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. In June 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. The balance in this account at September 30, 2018, was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs.Long-term debt. In September 2017, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, with maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. In October 2017, we redeemed all of the $1.75 billion principal amount outstanding of the 2017 Notes. The redemption was funded with the net proceeds from the new fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. We are not subject to any financial covenants and did not experience any changes to our investment credit ratings as a result of this debt issuance. See Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 46Table of ContentsCredit RatingsAt September 30, 2018, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’s Moody’sDebt typeRating Outlook Rating OutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1 Positive P-1 StableLong-term unsecured debtA+ Positive A1 StableVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2018, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $931 million. We hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2018, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle.U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2018, we deposited $600 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation, and made $150 million covered litigation payments that were funded from the U.S. litigation escrow account. At September 30, 2018, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion. In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into a new settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement. The proposed settlement amount is approximately $6.2 billion. Our share represents approximately $4.1 billion, the majority of which will be satisfied through funds previously deposited with the court plus the $600 million we deposited into its litigation escrow account in June 2018. No additional funds are required for this class settlement. Our share is covered under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases. Until the court approves the 2018 Settlement Agreement, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to resolve the damages class plaintiffs’ claims as contemplated by that agreement. If the 2018 Settlement Agreement is terminated and no further agreement is reached regarding funds previously paid from the litigation escrow account into court-supervised settlement funds, we will have the right to the majority of these funds, which would be returned to the U.S. litigation escrow account. This will increase our taxable income, thereby increasing our taxes to be paid. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceeding, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2018, share repurchases and escrow deposits reduced as-converted class A common stock by 63 million at an average price of $124.38 per share. Of the 63 million shares, 58 million were repurchased in the open market using $7.2 billion of cash on hand. Additionally, we deposited $600 million of operating cash into the U.S. litigation escrow account previously established under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our Class A common stock because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. 47Table of ContentsIn January 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for $7.5 billion. This authorization has no expiration date. As of September 30, 2018, we had remaining authorized funds of $4.2 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Dividends. During fiscal 2018, we declared and paid $1.9 billion in dividends. On October 16, 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $574 million in connection with this dividend on December 4, 2018. See Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the United States. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe’s defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million, $12 million and $4 million, respectively. For Visa Europe’s UK pension plans, we made contributions of $11 million, $5 million and $102 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, subsequent to the acquisition date as agreed upon with the trustees to improve the funding level of the plans. In fiscal 2019, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe’s UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $3 million and $10 million, respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 7—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2018, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. In February 2017, we acquired a business using $302 million of cash on hand, primarily reflecting total purchase price less cash received. The acquisition will help Visa’s clients and merchant partners accelerate digital commerce. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 5—Intangible Assets and Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2018, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $15.0 billion of assets and $22 million of liabilities. None of these instruments were valued using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 3—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below. 48Table of ContentsIndemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2018. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. Payments Due by Period Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years Total (in millions)Long-term debt(1)$537 $4,041 $4,140 $15,719 $24,437Purchase obligations(2)1,375 410 198 542 2,525Leases(3)180 225 164 178 747Transition tax(4)88 177 177 663 1,105Dividends(5)574 — — — 574Deferred purchase consideration(6)1,317 — — — 1,317Total(7),(8),(9)$4,071 $4,853 $4,679 $17,102 $30,705(1) Amounts presented include payments for both interest and principal. Also see Note 6—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. (2) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.(3) Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from less than one year to twenty years.(4) Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 16—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.(5) Includes expected dividend amount of $574 million as dividends were declared on October 16, 2018 and will be paid on December 4, 2018 to all holders of record of Visa’s common stock as of November 16, 2018.(6) On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Amount presented was converted to U.S. dollar at the September 30, 2018 exchange rate. (7) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2018, we had also accrued $99 million of interest and $34 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 7—Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(9) Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from one to eleven years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2018, we have $2.8 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements. 49Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management’s ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2018, client incentives represented 21% of gross operating revenues.Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account 50Table of Contentsbalance. We recorded an additional accrual of $600 million for U.S. covered litigation during fiscal 2018. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 2—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 17—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2018 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $280 million or loss of approximately $350 million, respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at September 30, 2018. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. On the third anniversary of the closing of the Visa Europe transaction, we will pay an additional purchase consideration of €1.0 billion, plus 4.0% compounded annual interest. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro. A hypothetical 10% decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018, would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by $130 million, including interest. 51Table of ContentsWe are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2018, would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion. We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $18.8 billion in Visa Europe as of September 30, 2018. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company’s net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates.The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2018 and 2017 were $5.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $31 million on our investment securities at September 30, 2018. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $3.5 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2018 and 2017, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $206 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $35 million in pension cost.At September 30, 2018 and 2017, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.4 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $148 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $13 million in pension cost.We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal 2019, if any, which would be made in September 2019. 52Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:22:12.499962

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2019.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate digital payments across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value added services.Financial overview.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Coronavirus. COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office and will continue to have most of our employees work remotely for the rest of 2020. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times.Revenues in the latter half of fiscal 2020 were impacted by declines in volumes and transactions as a result of COVID-19, although we are exiting the year with improved results and most countries had stable to positive year-over-year domestic spending growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. Cross-border volume however, remained depressed, led by travel spending, as the majority of borders remain closed. While we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel, lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.37Table of ContentsHighlights for fiscal 2020. Net revenues for fiscal 2020 were $21.8 billion, a decrease of 5% over the prior year, primarily due to the year-over-year changes payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. Exchange rate movements in fiscal 2020, partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.Total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were $7.8 billion on a GAAP basis, and decreased 3% over the prior year, driven by lower litigation provision and our overall cost reduction strategy, offset by higher personnel and depreciation and amortization from our ongoing investments in support of our strategy for future growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2020 were $7.7 billion on a non-GAAP basis, and increased 1% over the prior year primarily driven by higher personnel, offset by our overall cost reduction strategy.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to also exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation.•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and $600 million, respectively, and related tax benefits of $83 million and $137 million, respectively, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. •Charitable contributions. During fiscal 2018, we donated investment securities to the Visa Foundation and recognized a non-cash general and administrative expense of $195 million, before tax, and recorded $193 million of realized gain on the donation of these investments as non-operating income. Net of the related cash tax benefit of $51 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-GAAP net income decreased by $49 million.•Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2020, in connection with the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020, we 38Table of Contentsremeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $329 million. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Transition tax on foreign earnings. During fiscal 2018, in connection with the Tax Act requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimate of approximately $1.1 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Resolution of a tax item. During fiscal 2020, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, dating back more than 12 years, relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering. The resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge to income tax expense of $28 million, which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate.Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to the respective non-GAAP financial measures:For the Year Ended September 30, 2020Operating ExpensesNon-operating Income (Expense)Income Tax ProvisionEffective Income Tax Rate(1)Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per Share(1)(in millions, except percentages and per share data)As reported$7,765 $(291)$2,924 21.2 %$10,866 $4.89 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net— (101)(23)(78)(0.04)Amortization of acquired intangible assets(46)— 11 35 0.02 Acquisition-related costs(17)— 4 13 0.01 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances— — (329)329 0.15 Resolution of a tax item— — (28)28 0.01 Non-GAAP$7,702 $(392)$2,559 18.6 %$11,193 $5.04 For the Year Ended September 30, 2019Operating ExpensesNon-operating Income (Expense)Income Tax ProvisionEffective Income Tax Rate(1)Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per Share(1)(in millions, except percentages and per share data)As reported$7,976 $(117)$2,804 18.8 %$12,080 $5.32 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net— (131)(30)(101)(0.04)Amortization of acquired intangible assets(6)— 1 5 — Acquisition-related costs(4)— 1 3 — Litigation provision(370)— 83 287 0.13 Non-GAAP$7,596 $(248)$2,859 18.9 %$12,274 $5.40 39Table of ContentsFor the Year EndedSeptember 30, 2018Operating ExpensesNon-operating Income (Expense)Income Tax ProvisionEffective Income Tax Rate(1)Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per Share(1)(in millions, except percentages and per share data)As reported$7,655 $(148)$2,505 19.6 %$10,301 $4.42 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net— (98)(25)(73)(0.03)Charitable contribution(195)(193)51 (49)(0.02)Litigation provision(600)— 137 463 0.20 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances— — 1,133 (1,133)(0.49)Transition tax on foreign earnings— — (1,147)1,147 0.49 Non-GAAP$6,860 $(439)$2,654 20.3 %$10,656 $4.58 (1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Release of preferred stock. In September 2020, we released $7.3 billion of the as-converted value from our series B and C preferred stock (alternatively referred to as UK&I and Europe preferred stock, respectively) and issued 374,819 shares of series A preferred stock in connection with the first mandatory release assessment, as required by the litigation management deed entered into at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Common stock repurchases. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2020 Program”). During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.1 billion. As of September 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $5.5 billion for share repurchase. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Senior notes. In fiscal 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in public offerings in an aggregate principal amount of $7.3 billion with maturities ranging between 7 and 30 years. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. On November 5, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Visa from acquiring Plaid, alleging that the proposed acquisition would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and would constitute monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Visa intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues.Nominal payments volume growth in the U.S. for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was 4% and 10%, respectively. The decrease in nominal international payments volume of 1% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020(1) was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 was 2% and 9%, respectively. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19.40Table of ContentsThe following tables present nominal payments and cash volume: U.S.International Visa Inc. 12 months ended June 30,(1)12 monthsended June 30,(1)12 monthsended June 30,(1)20202019%Change(2)20202019%Change(2)20202019%Change(2) (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,518 $1,540 (1)%$2,361 $2,484 (5)%$3,879 $4,025 (4)%Consumer debit(3)1,851 1,699 9 %1,974 1,877 5 %3,824 3,576 7 %Commercial(4)641 634 1 %369 381 (3)%1,010 1,015 — %Total nominal payments volume(2)$4,009 $3,873 4 %$4,704 $4,742 (1)%$8,713 $8,615 1 %Cash volume573 573 — %2,046 2,261 (9)%2,620 2,834 (8)%Total nominal volume(2),(5)$4,583 $4,447 3 %$6,750 $7,003 (4)%$11,333 $11,450 (1)% U.S.InternationalVisa Inc. 12 monthsended June 30,(1)12 monthsended June 30,(1)12 months ended June 30,(1)20192018%Change(2)20192018%Change(2)20192018%Change(2) (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,540 $1,441 7 %$2,484 $2,455 1 %$4,025 $3,897 3 %Consumer debit(3)1,699 1,521 12 %1,877 1,792 5 %3,576 3,313 8 %Commercial(4)634 564 12 %381 364 5 %1,015 927 9 %Total nominal payments volume(2)$3,873 $3,526 10 %$4,742 $4,611 3 %$8,615 $8,137 6 %Cash volume573 563 2 %2,261 2,437 (7)%2,834 3,000 (6)%Total nominal volume(2),(5)$4,447 $4,089 9 %$7,003 $7,048 (1)%$11,450 $11,137 3 %The following table presents the change in nominal and constant payments and cash volume:InternationalVisa Inc.12 months endedJune 30,2020 vs 2019(1)12 months endedJune 30,2019 vs 2018(1)12 months endedJune 30,2020 vs 2019(1)12 months endedJune 30,2019 vs 2018(1) NominalConstant(6)NominalConstant(6)NominalConstant(6)NominalConstant(6)Payments volume growthConsumer credit growth(5)%(2)%1 %8 %(4)%(2)%3 %7 %Consumer debit growth(3)5 %9 %5 %11 %7 %9 %8 %11 %Commercial growth(4)(3)%— %5 %13 %— %1 %9 %12 %Total payments volume growth(2)(1)%2 %3 %9 %1 %3 %6 %10 %Cash volume growth(9)%(6)%(7)%— %(8)%(5)%(6)%— %Total volume growth(2)(4)%(1)%(1)%6 %(1)%1 %3 %7 %(1)Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenues reported for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.(2)Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3)Includes consumer prepaid volume and interlink volume.(4)Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.(5)Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (6)Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.41Table of ContentsThe following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, VPAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks:For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1)2020201920182020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018(in millions, except percentages)Visa processed transactions140,839 138,329 124,320 2 %11 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.Financial Information PresentationNet Revenues Our net revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants as well as establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our net revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa payment services. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current quarter’s pricing applied to the prior quarter’s payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volumes are transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, value added services, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed.International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer, or financial institution originating the transaction, is different from that of the beneficiary. International transaction revenues are recognized in the same period the cross-border transactions occur or services are performed.Other revenues consist mainly of value added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed.Client incentives consist of incentives provided in contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to grow payments volume, increase Visa product acceptance, win merchant routing transactions over our network and drive innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, severance charges and contractor expense. Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. 42Table of ContentsNetwork and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative expenses consist mainly of product enhancements, facilities costs, travel activities, indirect taxes, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss.Non-operating Income (Expense)Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments, income from derivative instruments not associated with our core business, as well as the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expenses. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,$ Change% Change(1) 2020201920182020vs.20192019vs.20182020vs.20192019vs.2018 (in millions, except percentages)U.S.$10,125 $10,279 $9,332 $(154)$947 (1)%10 %International11,721 12,698 11,277 (977)1,421 (8)%13 %Net revenues$21,846 $22,977 $20,609 $(1,131)$2,368 (5)%11 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the year-over-year changes in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in the latter part of March 2020.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in fiscal 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.43Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,$ Change% Change(1) 2020201920182020vs.20192019vs.20182020vs.20192019vs.2018 (in millions, except percentages)Service revenues$9,804 $9,700 $8,918 $104 $782 1 %9 %Data processing revenues10,975 10,333 9,027 642 1,306 6 %14 %International transaction revenues6,299 7,804 7,211 (1,505)593 (19)%8 %Other revenues1,432 1,313 944 119 369 9 %39 %Client incentives(6,664)(6,173)(5,491)(491)(682)8 %12 %Net revenues$21,846 $22,977 $20,609 $(1,131)$2,368 (5)%11 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

International transaction revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications.•Other revenues increased primarily due to the increase in consulting and marketing services related fees, other value added services and acquisition-related revenues.•Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2020 partially offset by the recent decline in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Operating ExpensesThe following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,$ Change% Change(1) 2020201920182020vs.20192019vs.20182020vs.20192019vs.2018 (in millions, except percentages)Personnel$3,785 $3,444 $3,170 $341 $274 10 %9 %Marketing971 1,105 988 (134)117 (12)%12 %Network and processing727 721 686 6 35 1 %5 %Professional fees408 454 446 (46)8 (10)%2 %Depreciation and amortization767 656 613 111 43 17 %7 %General and administrative1,096 1,196 1,145 (100)51 (8)%4 %Litigation provision11 400 607 (389)(207)(97)%(34)%Total operating expenses(2)$7,765 $7,976 $7,655 $(211)$321 (3)%4 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

The remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities was primarily related to deferred taxes on intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016.45Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:For the Years EndedSeptember 30,202020192018 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$10,440 $12,784 $12,941 Investing activities1,427 (591)(3,084)Financing activities(3,968)(12,061)(10,790)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents440 (277)(101)Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents$8,339 $(145)$(1,034)Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower net income, higher client incentive payments and timing of settlement.Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, combined with fewer investment security purchases, lower purchase consideration paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, due to fewer acquisitions and lower purchases of other investments.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2020 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes, the absence of the deferred purchase consideration payment made in the prior year and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividends paid. See Note 10—Debt and Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.46Table of ContentsSources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.Available-for-sale debt securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.6 billion, are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2020. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit facility. We have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires on July 25, 2024. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2020. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Senior notes. In fiscal 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in public offerings in an aggregate principal amount of $7.3 billion with maturities between 7 and 30 years. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the U.S. litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. The balance in this account at September 30, 2020, was $0.9 billion and is reflected as restricted cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit RatingsAt September 30, 2020, our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were as follows: Standard and Poor’sMoody’sDebt typeRatingOutlookRatingOutlookShort-term unsecured debtA-1+StableP-1StableLong-term unsecured debtAA-StableAa3Stable47Table of ContentsVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2020, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a net payable of $452 million. We hold approximately $7.7 billion of available liquidity globally as of September 30, 2020, in the form of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle.U.S. covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the U.S. covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation are payable from the U.S. litigation escrow account. In September 2018, Visa and other defendants entered into an Amended Settlement Agreement with plaintiffs in the interchange multidistrict litigation purporting to represent a class of plaintiffs seeking monetary damages, which superseded and amended the 2012 Settlement Agreement. In December 2019, the district court granted final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement relating to claims by the Damages Class, which was subsequently appealed. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing.During fiscal 2020, we have reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40% of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. At September 30, 2020, the U.S. litigation escrow account had an available balance of $0.9 billion for settlement with opt-out merchants.Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the U.S. covered litigation, including VE territory covered litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.1 billion. As of September 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $5.5 billion. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Dividends. During fiscal 2020, we declared and paid $2.7 billion in dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.30 per share. On October 23, 2020, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $703 million in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2020. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for substantially all employees residing in the U.S. As a result of the acquisition of Visa Europe, we assumed the obligations related to Visa Europe’s defined benefit plan, primarily consisting of the UK pension plans. Our policy with respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan is to contribute annually in September of each year, an amount not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our U.S. non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. In relation to the Visa Europe UK pension plans, our funding policy is to contribute in accordance with the appropriate funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our UK pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed with the UK pension plan trustees. In fiscal 2020, we made contributions to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $3 million and to our Visa Europe’s UK pension plans of $22 million. In fiscal 2021, given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding 48Table of Contentsour U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and Visa Europe’s UK defined benefit pension plans by approximately $2 million and $10 million, respectively. The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. See Note 11—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures decreased slightly during fiscal 2020. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.Senior notes. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Acquisitions. In fiscal 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. On November 5, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Visa from acquiring Plaid. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than purchase order commitments, as discussed and reflected in our contractual obligations table below. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients and partners under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. 49Table of ContentsContractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2020. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities.

(2)Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent.(3)Includes operating leases for premises and equipment, which range in original lease terms from less than one year to twenty-six years.(4)Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.(5)Includes expected dividend amount of $703 million as dividends were declared on October 23, 2020 and will be paid on December 1, 2020 to all holders of record of Visa’s common and preferred stock as of November 13, 2020.(6)We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020, we had also accrued $233 million of interest and $31 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table.(7)We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 11—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.(8)Future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners are not included in the table as the amounts are unknowable due to the inherent unpredictability of payment and transaction volume. These agreements, which range in terms from less than one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets or marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. As of September 30, 2020, we have $4.4 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. 50Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2020, client incentives represented 23% of gross revenues.Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on management’s understanding of the litigation profile, the specifics of each case, our history with similar proceedings, advice of in-house and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. 51Table of ContentsAssumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. At September 30, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2020 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical 10% strengthening or weakening in the value of the functional currencies at September 30, 2020 is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately $210 million or loss of approximately $260 million, respectively, on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The gain or loss from this hypothetical strengthening or weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain or loss on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2020, would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.2 billion. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.52Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our statements of operations or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates.The fair value of our fixed-rate investment securities at September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $4.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $2.0 billion and $4.6 billion at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in fair value of approximately $3.5 million on our investment securities at September 30, 2020. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would create an estimated increase in fair value of approximately $7.2 million on our investment securities at September 30, 2020.In fiscal 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $30 million in annual interest expense. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Equity Investment RiskAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.0 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. These investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. A decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-marketable equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2020 and 2019, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.1 billion and projected benefit obligations were $0.9 billion at each year end. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate as of September 30, 2020 would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $221 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $44 million in pension cost.At September 30, 2020 and 2019, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.5 billion at each year end and projected benefit obligations were $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate as of September 30, 2020 would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $194 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $17 million in pension cost.We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2021, if any, which would be made in September 2021.53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:21:43.768702
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2021,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 19, 2020.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, reliable and secure electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. We facilitate global commerce and money movement across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies. Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to offer products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem.Financial overview. A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results are as follows: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2021202020192021vs.20202020vs.2019 (in millions, except percentages and per share data)Net revenues$24,105 $21,846 $22,977 10 %(5 %)Operating expenses$8,301 $7,765 $7,976 7 %(3 %)Net income$12,311 $10,866 $12,080 13 %(10 %)Diluted earnings per share$5.63 $4.89 $5.32 15 %(8 %)Non-GAAP operating expenses(2)$8,077 $7,702 $7,596 5 %1 %Non-GAAP net income(2)$12,933 $11,193 $12,274 16 %(9 %)Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(2)$5.91 $5.04 $5.40 17 %(7 %)(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Coronavirus. As the effects of an evolving coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues, much remains uncertain. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times.The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak; new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including vaccines and treatments; the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, suppliers and business partners; and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.Highlights for fiscal 2021. Net revenues were $24.1 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, primarily due to the year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume, helped by 33Table of Contentsfewer COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives. Exchange rate movements and our hedging program positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.GAAP operating expenses were $8.3 billion and increased 7% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $8.1 billion and increased 5% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher personnel and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. Exchange rate movements negatively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately half a percentage point.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2021, in connection with the UK enacted legislation on June 10, 2021 that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023, we remeasured our UK deferred tax liabilities, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $1.0 billion. During fiscal 2020, in connection with the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020, we remeasured our UK deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $329 million. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Indirect taxes. During fiscal 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, before tax. Net of the related income tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-GAAP net income increased by $112 million. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations.•Resolution of a tax item. During fiscal 2020, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, dating back more than 12 years, relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering. The resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge to income tax expense of $28 million, which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate.34Table of Contents•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2019, we recorded a litigation provision of $370 million and related tax benefits of $83 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Common stock repurchases. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized an $8.0 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2021 Program”). During fiscal 2021, we repurchased 40 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.7 billion. As of September 30, 2021, our January 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of $4.8 billion for share repurchase. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Pending acquisitions. On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (“Tink”) for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals.On July 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”). The acquisition values Currencycloud at £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that we already own. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals.Terminated acquisition. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced on January 13, 2020. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues.Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.36Table of ContentsThe following tables present nominal payments and cash volume: U.S.International Visa Inc. 12 months ended June 30,(1)12 monthsended June 30,(1)12 monthsended June 30,(1)20212020%Change(2)20212020%Change(2)20212020%Change(2) (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,641 $1,518 8 %$2,396 $2,362 1 %$4,036 $3,880 4 %Consumer debit(3)2,387 1,848 29 %2,440 1,975 24 %4,828 3,824 26 %Commercial(4)697 641 9 %406 370 10 %1,103 1,011 9 %Total nominal payments volume(2)$4,725 $4,007 18 %$5,243 $4,707 11 %$9,968 $8,714 14 %Cash volume(5)635 573 11 %1,927 2,045 (6 %)2,561 2,619 (2 %)Total nominal volume(2),(6)$5,359 $4,580 17 %$7,169 $6,753 6 %$12,529 $11,333 11 % U.S.InternationalVisa Inc. 12 monthsended June 30,(1)12 monthsended June 30,(1)12 months ended June 30,(1)20202019%Change(2)20202019%Change(2)20202019%Change(2) (in billions, except percentages)Nominal payments volume Consumer credit$1,518 $1,540 (1 %)$2,362 $2,484 (5 %)$3,880 $4,024 (4 %)Consumer debit(3)1,848 1,699 9 %1,975 1,878 5 %3,824 3,577 7 %Commercial(4)641 634 1 %370 381 (3 %)1,011 1,015 — %Total nominal payments volume(2)$4,007 $3,873 3 %$4,707 $4,743 (1 %)$8,714 $8,616 1 %Cash volume(5)573 573 — %2,045 2,262 (10 %)2,619 2,835 (8 %)Total nominal volume(2),(6)$4,580 $4,447 3 %$6,753 $7,005 (4 %)$11,333 $11,451 (1 %)The following table presents the change in nominal and constant payments and cash volume:InternationalVisa Inc.12 months endedJune 30,2021 vs 2020(1),(2)12 months endedJune 30,2020 vs 2019(1),(2)12 months endedJune 30,2021 vs 2020(1),(2)12 months endedJune 30,2020 vs 2019(1),(2) NominalConstant(7)NominalConstant(7)NominalConstant(7)NominalConstant(7)Payments volume growthConsumer credit growth1 %(1 %)(5 %)(3 %)4 %3 %(4 %)(2 %)Consumer debit growth(3)24 %21 %5 %8 %26 %25 %7 %8 %Commercial growth(4)10 %7 %(3 %)— %9 %8 %— %1 %Total payments volume growth11 %9 %(1 %)2 %14 %13 %1 %2 %Cash volume growth(5)(6 %)(3 %)(10 %)(7 %)(2 %)— %(8 %)(5 %)Total volume growth6 %5 %(4 %)(1 %)11 %10 %(1 %)1 %(1)Service revenues in a given quarter are assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter.

See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further discussion on the components of our net revenues.The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2021202020192021vs.20202020vs.2019 (in millions, except percentages)U.S.$11,160 $10,125 $10,279 10 %(1 %)International12,945 11,721 12,698 10 %(8 %)Net revenues$24,105 $21,846 $22,977 10 %(5 %)(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues increased in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed transactions and cross-border volume, helped by fewer COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2021, exchange rate movements and our hedging program positively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately half a percentage point.The following table presents the components of our net revenues: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2021202020192021vs.20202020vs.2019 (in millions, except percentages)Service revenues$11,475 $9,804 $9,700 17 %1 %Data processing revenues12,792 10,975 10,333 17 %6 %International transaction revenues6,530 6,299 7,804 4 %(19 %)Other revenues1,675 1,432 1,313 17 %9 %Client incentives(8,367)(6,664)(6,173)26 %8 %Net revenues$24,105 $21,846 $22,977 10 %(5 %)(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Service revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications and business mix. •Data processing revenues increased due to 17% growth in processed transactions, as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020.•International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 4%, as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and border restrictions were relaxed in various markets.•Other revenues increased as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020, driven by higher consulting and data services revenues.•Client incentives increased in conjunction with the increase in payments volume during fiscal 2021. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of the following: •Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation, contractor expense and severance charges. •Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. •Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. •Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. •Depreciation and amortization expenses include amortization of purchased and internally developed software, as well as depreciation expense for property and equipment. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. •General and administrative expenses consist mainly of card benefits, indirect taxes, facilities costs, travel and meeting costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. •Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss.39Table of ContentsThe following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2021202020192021vs.20202020vs.2019 (in millions, except percentages)Personnel$4,240 $3,785 $3,444 12 %10 %Marketing1,136 971 1,105 17 %(12 %)Network and processing730 727 721 — %1 %Professional fees403 408 454 (1 %)(10 %)Depreciation and amortization804 767 656 5 %17 %General and administrative985 1,096 1,196 (10 %)(8 %)Litigation provision3 11 400 (76 %)(97 %)Total operating expenses(2)$8,301 $7,765 $7,976 7 %(3 %)(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Overview within this Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.•Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount and incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth.•Marketing expenses increased as we lapped reductions in spending in the prior year at the outset of COVID-19 as well as higher spending in client marketing and various campaigns, including the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, which were held in Summer 2021.•General and administrative expenses decreased due to lower travel expenses, favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower usage of travel related card benefits, partially offset by a one-time charge to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable laws.Non-operating Income (Expense)Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense, gains and losses earned on investments, income from derivative instruments not associated with our core business, as well as the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expense. The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2021202020192021vs.20202020vs.2019 (in millions, except percentages)Interest expense, net$(513)$(516)$(533)(1 %)(3 %)Investment income and other772 225 416 243 %(46 %)Total non-operating income (expense)$259 $(291)$(117)(189 %)148 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Investment income and other increased primarily due to higher gains from our equity investments, partially offset by lower interest income on our cash and investments. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.40Table of ContentsEffective Income Tax RateThe following table presents our effective income tax rates: For the Years EndedSeptember 30, 202120202019Effective income tax rate23 %21 %19 %The effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 mainly due to the following:•during fiscal 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities, as discussed below;•during fiscal 2021, $255 million of tax benefits recognized as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities; and•during fiscal 2020, a $329 million non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities, as discussed below.On June 10, 2021, the UK enacted legislation that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. On July 22, 2020, the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020. As a result, in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we recorded non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of our UK deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”) in fiscal 2016.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.41Table of ContentsCash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:For the Years EndedSeptember 30,202120202019 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$15,227 $10,440 $12,784 Investing activities(152)1,427 (591)Financing activities(14,410)(3,968)(12,061)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents(37)440 (277)Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents$628 $8,339 $(145)Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in our underlying business, lower client incentive payments and timing and impact of COVID-19 on settlement in the prior fiscal year.Investing activities. Cash was used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher purchases, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to the absence of proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in the prior year, the $3.0 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes and higher share repurchases. See Note 10—Debt and Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the return that these holdings provide.Cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents balance were $16.5 billion and our available-for-sale debt securities were $3.2 billion. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. $1.5 billion of the investments are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. At September 30, 2021, we had no outstanding obligations under the program. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.42Table of ContentsCredit facility. We have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires on July 25, 2024. As of September 30, 2021, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit RatingsVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payments industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. Our credit ratings are published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the U.S. and have not changed from the prior-year comparable period. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2021, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. At September 30, 2021, we held $9.1 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings, other than the U.S. covered litigation and VE territory covered litigation, which are covered by the U.S. and Europe retrospective responsibility plans, could give rise to future liquidity needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2021, we repurchased 40 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.7 billion. As of September 30, 2021, our January 2021 Program had remaining authorized funds of $4.8 billion. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Dividends. During fiscal 2021, we declared and paid $2.8 billion in dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.32 per share. On October 22, 2021, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $812 million in connection with this dividend on December 7, 2021. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Capital expenditures. During fiscal 2021, our capital expenditures decreased slightly. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives.Senior notes. As of September 30, 2021, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our fixed-rate senior notes of $21.0 billion with maturity dates ranging from September 2022 to August 2050. During fiscal 2021, we repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of our senior notes. A principal payment of $1.0 billion is 43Table of Contentsdue on September 14, 2022 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. In August 2020, we issued a $500 million green bond as part of our commitment to sustainable living and a sustainable payments ecosystem. In fiscal 2021, we allocated $165 million to eligible green projects. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Client incentives. As the future cash payments for these agreements, which range in terms from less than one to fifteen years, are based on specific performance requirements, the timing of payments can vary. As of September 30, 2021, we had $5.4 billion of client incentives liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2021, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.8 billion for which we cannot determine the range and timing of the cash payments. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Pending acquisitions. On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. On July 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Currencycloud for a value of £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that we already own. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Other uses of cash. The following table represents material, expected or contractually committed future obligations as of September 30, 2021. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facility.

For future lease payments related to leases that have commenced and are included in the consolidated balance sheet, see Note 9—Leases to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.(3)Amounts presented relate to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries recognized during fiscal 2018 in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.IndemnificationsWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.44Table of ContentsAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2021, client incentives represented 26% of gross revenues.45Table of ContentsLegal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a potential loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on management’s understanding of the litigation profile, the specifics of each case, our history with similar proceedings, advice of in-house and outside legal counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws. We also inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. 46Table of ContentsAt September 30, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $2.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2021 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. At September 30, 2021, the effect of a hypothetical 10% weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately $190 million on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The loss from this hypothetical weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the Euro. Translation from the Euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2021 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $2.0 billion. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.Interest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income.At September 30, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of our fixed-rate investment securities were $5.5 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, and the fair value of our adjustable-rate investment securities were $0.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately $40 million. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. We have interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into U.S. dollar and Euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million in annual interest expense. See Note 13—Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Equity Investment RiskAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. These investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our holdings. A decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-marketable equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.47Table of ContentsPension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2021 and 2020, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.9 billion at each year end. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. As of September 30, 2021, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $225 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $26 million in pension cost.At September 30, 2021 and 2020, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.5 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. As of September 30, 2021, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $166 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $16 million in pension cost.We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2022, if any, which would be made in September 2022.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:21:43.287236
1403161,V,VISA INC.,2022,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.OverviewVisa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. We provide transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through VisaNet, our advanced transaction processing network. We offer products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem.Financial overview. A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2022202120202022vs.20212021vs.2020 (in millions, except percentages and per share data)Net revenues$29,310 $24,105 $21,846 22 %10 %Operating expenses$10,497 $8,301 $7,765 26 %7 %Net income$14,957 $12,311 $10,866 21 %13 %Diluted earnings per share$7.00 $5.63 $4.89 24 %15 %Non-GAAP operating expenses(2)$9,387 $8,077 $7,702 16 %5 %Non-GAAP net income(2)$16,034 $12,933 $11,193 24 %16 %Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(2)$7.50 $5.91 $5.04 27 %17 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.(2)For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. Since 2015, domestic transactions have been processed by Russia’s state-owned payments operator, National Payment Card System. With respect to cross-border activities, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside Russia no longer work within Russia, and all transactions on cards issued by financial institutions in Russia may be processed on a domestic network, unrelated to Visa, and no longer work outside the country. Furthermore, during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 we deconsolidated our Russian subsidiary, as required under U.S. GAAP. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 2% and 4% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. The continuing effects of the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business.32Table of ContentsHighlights for fiscal 2022. Net revenues increased 22% over the prior year, primarily due to the year-over-year growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Exchange rate movements, partially offset by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately two-and-a-half percentage points.GAAP operating expenses increased 26% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher expenses for litigation provision and personnel. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher expenses related to personnel and general and administrative. Exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately two-and-a-half percentage points.Release of preferred stock. In July 2022, we released $3.5 billion of the as-converted value from our series B and C preferred stock and issued 176,655 shares of series A preferred stock in connection with the second mandatory release assessment, as required by the litigation management deed entered into at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition.

In June 2022, we issued €3.0 billion in Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes with maturities ranging between 4 and 12 years. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Acquisitions. On December 20, 2021, we acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (Currencycloud), a global platform that enables financial institutions and fintechs to provide innovative cross-border foreign exchange solutions, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). On March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink AB (Tink) for $1.9 billion in cash. Tink is an open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During fiscal 2022, we recorded additional accruals of $861 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Common stock repurchases. In December 2021, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 56 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $11.6 billion. As of September 30, 2022, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $5.2 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.•Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.•Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and 33Table of Contentssize of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.•Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Litigation provision. During fiscal 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $861 million and related tax benefit of $191 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock convert into shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Russia-Ukraine charges. During fiscal 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.•Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During fiscal 2021, in connection with the UK enacted legislation on June 10, 2021 that increases the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023, we remeasured our UK deferred tax liabilities, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $1.0 billion. During fiscal 2020, in connection with the UK enacted legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020, we remeasured our UK deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $329 million.•Indirect taxes. During fiscal 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, and related tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations.•Resolution of a tax item. During fiscal 2020, we resolved a long-outstanding tax matter, dating back more than 12 years, relating to certain tax filing positions taken prior to our initial public offering. The resolution of this matter resulted in the recognition of a one-time charge to income tax expense of $28 million, which we believe is not representative of our continuing operations and ongoing effective tax rate.34Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues.Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.The following tables present nominal payments and cash volume: U.S.International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (2)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for further discussion on the components of our net revenues.The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2022202120202022vs.20212021vs.2020 (in millions, except percentages)U.S.$12,851 $11,160 $10,125 15 %10 %International16,459 12,945 11,721 27 %10 %Net revenues$29,310 $24,105 $21,846 22 %10 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.Net revenues increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to the year-over-year growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives.Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. In fiscal 2022, exchange rate movements, partially offset by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately two-and-a-half percentage points.The following table presents the components of our net revenues: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2022202120202022vs.20212021vs.2020 (in millions, except percentages)Service revenues$13,361 $11,475 $9,804 16 %17 %Data processing revenues14,438 12,792 10,975 13 %17 %International transaction revenues9,815 6,530 6,299 50 %4 %Other revenues1,991 1,675 1,432 19 %17 %Client incentives(10,295)(8,367)(6,664)23 %26 %Net revenues$29,310 $24,105 $21,846 22 %10 %(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

International transaction revenues also increased due to volatility of a broad range of currencies and select pricing modifications.•Other revenues increased primarily due to select pricing modifications, travel related card benefits, value added services revenues tied to marketing services, consulting revenues and other value added services. 38Table of Contents•Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume during fiscal 2022. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of the following: •Personnel expenses include salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expenses. •Marketing expenses include expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. •Network and processing expenses mainly represent expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. •Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. •Depreciation and amortization expenses include amortization of purchased and internally developed software, as well as depreciation expense for property and equipment. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. •General and administrative expenses consist mainly of card benefits, facilities costs, indirect taxes, travel and meeting costs, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses incurred in support of our business. •Litigation provision represents litigation expenses and is an estimate based on management’s understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss.The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2022202120202022vs.20212021vs.2020 (in millions, except percentages)Personnel$4,990 $4,240 $3,785 18 %12 %Marketing1,336 1,136 971 18 %17 %Network and processing743 730 727 2 %— %Professional fees505 403 408 25 %(1 %)Depreciation and amortization861 804 767 7 %5 %General and administrative1,194 985 1,096 21 %(10 %)Litigation provision868 3 11 NM(76 %)Total operating expenses(2)$10,497 $8,301 $7,765 26 %7 %NM - Not meaningful(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

See Overview within this Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Total operating expenses increased as we invested in future growth and due to the provision for U.S. covered litigation.•Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher number of employees and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions. The increase also included expenses incurred as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine.•Marketing expenses increased due to higher spending in various campaigns, including the FIFA World Cup 2022TM and the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, and client marketing.39Table of Contents•Professional fees increased primarily due to consulting fees related to technology and other corporate projects.•General and administrative expenses increased due to higher usage of travel related card benefits, higher travel expenses, the suspension of our operations in Russia and deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary and the inclusion of expenses from our acquisitions, partially offset by a one-time charge of indirect taxes in the prior year.•Litigation provision increased primarily due to additional accruals of $861 million related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Non-operating Income (Expense)Non-operating income (expense) primarily includes interest expense related to borrowings, income from derivative instruments, interest expense from tax liabilities, gains and losses on investments, as well as the non-service components of net periodic pension income and expense.The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): For the Years EndedSeptember 30,% Change(1) 2022202120202022vs.20212021vs.2020 (in millions, except percentages)Interest expense$(538)$(513)$(516)5 %(1 %)Investment income (expense) and other(139)772 225 (118 %)243 %Total non-operating income (expense)$(677)$259 $(291)(361 %)(189 %)(1)Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.•Interest expense increased primarily due to higher interest expense related to income tax liabilities and the issuance of debt in fiscal 2022, combined with lower income from derivative instruments that decreased the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.•Investment income (expense) and other decreased primarily due to losses on our equity investments, offset by higher interest income on our cash and investments. See Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Effective Income Tax RateThe following table presents our effective income tax rates: For the Years EndedSeptember 30, 202220212020Effective income tax rate18 %23 %21 %The effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 differs from the effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the following:•during fiscal 2022, a decrease in the state tax apportionment ratio, including a $176 million tax benefit related to prior years, as a result of a tax position taken related to a recent ruling;•during fiscal 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities as a result of the increase in UK tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023; and•during fiscal 2021, $255 million of tax benefits recognized as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities.40Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesManagement of Our LiquidityWe regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives.The objectives of our treasury policies are to:•provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios;•ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; •ensure payments on required litigation settlements;•make planned capital investments in our business;•pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and•invest excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs, and earn additional income.Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented:For the Years EndedSeptember 30,202220212020 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$18,849 $15,227 $10,440 Investing activities(4,288)(152)1,427 Financing activities(12,696)(14,410)(3,968)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents(1,287)(37)440 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents$578 $628 $8,339 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher litigation payments.Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to lower proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, combined with higher purchases of investment securities and higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and lower principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes, partially offset by higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid. See Note 10—Debt and Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.41Table of ContentsSources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide.Cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents balance were $15.7 billion and our available-for-sale debt securities were $4.5 billion. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. $2.3 billion of the investments are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-current investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we issued and repaid $950 million of commercial paper. As of September 30, 2022, we had no outstanding obligations under the program. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit facility. We have an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) which expires on July 25, 2024. As of September 30, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Senior notes. In June 2022, we issued €3.0 billion ($3.2 billion) in Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes, with maturities ranging between 4 and 12 years. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Credit RatingsVarious factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payments industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. Our credit ratings are published by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the U.S. and have not changed from the prior-year comparable period. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets.42Table of ContentsUses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2022, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. As of September 30, 2022, we held $9.2 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings, other than the U.S. covered litigation and VE territory covered litigation, which are covered by the U.S. and Europe retrospective responsibility plans, could give rise to future liquidity needs. During fiscal 2022, we deposited $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of September 30, 2022 was $1.4 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $11.6 billion. As of September 30, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $5.2 billion. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases will be executed at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and our financial performance, and may be effected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Dividends. During fiscal 2022, we declared and paid $3.2 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On October 21, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $950 million in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2022. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Capital expenditures. During fiscal 2022, our capital expenditures increased. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure.Senior notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our senior notes of $22.9 billion. During fiscal 2022, we repaid $1.0 billion of principal upon maturity of certain senior notes. A principal payment on certain senior notes of $2.3 billion is due in December 2022, for which we have sufficient liquidity. As of September 30, 2022, we allocated $243 million to eligible green projects from the $500 million green bond issued as part of our commitment to environmental sustainability and a sustainable payments ecosystem. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Client incentives. As of September 30, 2022, we had short-term and long-term liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements of $6.1 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2022, we had long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.8 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.43Table of ContentsAcquisitions. On December 20, 2021, we acquired Currencycloud for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud), and on March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink for $1.9 billion in cash. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Purchase obligations. As of September 30, 2022, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, related to agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. For future obligations related to software licenses, see Note 18—Commitments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Leases. As of September 30, 2022, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $3 million and $528 million, respectively, related to leases that have not yet commenced. For future lease payments related to leases that have commenced and are included in the consolidated balance sheet, see Note 9—Leases to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of September 30, 2022, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $87 million and $589 million, respectively, related to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries recognized during fiscal 2018.IndemnificationsWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. 44Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2022, client incentives represented 26% of gross revenues.Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and based on a number of factors, including management’s understanding of the legal or regulatory profile and the specifics of each proceeding, our history with similar matters, advice of internal and external legal counsel and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. 45Table of ContentsAssumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws. We also inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at September 30, 2022 is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. At September 30, 2022, the effect of a hypothetical 10% weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately $220 million on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The loss from this hypothetical weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the Euro. Translation from the Euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at September 30, 2022 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $1.8 billion.We designated a portion of our Euro-denominated senior notes as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment in Visa Europe as of September 30, 2022. Changes in the value of the designated portion of the Euro-denominated senior notes, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the Euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.46Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income.At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our fixed-rate investment securities were $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, and the fair value of our adjustable-rate investment securities were not material and $0.2 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately $47 million. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. We have interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into U.S. dollar and Euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million in annual interest expense. See Note 13—Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Equity Investment RiskOur equity investments are held in both marketable and non-marketable equity securities. The marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and the non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies.As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our marketable equity securities was $291 million and $323 million, respectively. These securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. These investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of our holdings. A decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-marketable equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.Pension Plan RiskAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. As of September 30, 2022, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $150 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $32 million in pension cost.At September 30, 2022 and 2021, our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, and projected benefit obligations were $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plans, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. As of September 30, 2022, a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 1% decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately $82 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $11 million in pension cost.We will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plans for fiscal 2023, if any, which would be made in September 2023.47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:21:46.443357

We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.Cash Flow DataThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity:For the Years EndedSeptember 30,202320222021 (in millions)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$20,755 $18,849 $15,227 Investing activities$(2,006)$(4,288)$(152)Financing activities$(17,772)$(12,696)$(14,410)Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher incentive payments.Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was lower than the prior fiscal year primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year and lower purchases of investment securities, partially offset by lower sales and maturities of investment securities.Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2023 was higher than the prior fiscal year primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, higher principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes, higher dividends paid and higher share repurchases.Sources of Liquidity Cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents balance were $16.3 billion and our available-for-sale debt securities were $5.4 billion. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. government-sponsored agencies. $3.5 billion of the investments are classified as current and are available to meet short-term liquidity needs. The remaining non-43Table of Contentscurrent investments have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date; however, they are also generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs.Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment.Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding obligations under the program. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Credit facility. We have an unsecured $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2028. As of September 30, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.U.S. Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which was created to insulate Visa and our class A common shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases, we maintain a U.S. litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation will be payable. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation matters, we do not rely on them for other operational needs. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due to and from our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. Most U.S. dollar settlements are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance, while settlements in currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. In general, during fiscal 2023, we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. As of September 30, 2023, we held $10.1 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. See Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation or other fines imposed in investigations and proceedings could give rise to future liquidity needs. During fiscal 2023, we deposited $1.0 billion into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of September 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $12.2 billion. As of September 30, 2023, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $5.0 billion. In October 2023, our board of directors authorized a new $25.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year flexibility. Share repurchases will be executed at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including market conditions and our financial performance, and may be effected through accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. See Note 15—Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Dividends. During fiscal 2023, we declared and paid $3.8 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On October 24, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $1.1 billion in connection with this dividend on December 1, 2023. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to 44Table of Contentsapproval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends.Senior notes. As of September 30, 2023, we had an outstanding aggregate principal amount relating to our senior notes of $20.9 billion. During fiscal 2023, we repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes. Since the issuance of the $500 million green bond as part of our commitment to environmental sustainability and a sustainable payments ecosystem, we have allocated $391 million to eligible green projects. See Note 10—Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Client incentives. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to these agreements of $8.2 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively.Uncertain tax positions. As of September 30, 2023, we had long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.6 billion. See Note 19—Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Pending acquisition. In June 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo for $1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals.Purchase obligations. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $1.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively, related to agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. For future obligations related to software licenses, see Note 18—Commitments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Leases. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $12 million and $421 million, respectively, related to leases that have not yet commenced. For future lease payments related to leases that have commenced and are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet, see Note 9—Leases to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of September 30, 2023, we had short-term and long-term obligations of $162 million and $431 million, respectively, related to the estimated transition tax, net of foreign tax credit carryovers, on certain foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries recognized during fiscal 2018.IndemnificationsWe indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating rules. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12—Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates, which we have either determined to be not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. 45Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition—Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into long-term incentive agreements with financial institution clients, merchants and other business partners for various programs that provide cash and other incentives designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to our network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to net revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. Incentives are recognized systematically and rationally based on management’s estimate of each client’s performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments and transaction volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using client-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information, market and economic conditions and discussions with our clients, merchants and business partners. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If actual performance is not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and estimate the amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and based on a number of factors, including management’s understanding of the legal or regulatory profile and the specifics of each proceeding, our history with similar matters, advice of internal and external legal counsel and management’s best estimate of incurred loss. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential loss related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. We have entered into loss sharing agreements that reduce our potential liability under certain litigation. However, our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the U.S. covered litigation. The plan’s mechanisms include the use of the U.S. litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. Our Europe retrospective responsibility plan only covers Visa Europe territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, subject to certain limitations, and does not cover any fines or penalties incurred in the European Commission proceedings or any other matter. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 20—Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.46Table of ContentsAssumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws. We also inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskMarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the effect of a hypothetical 10% weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value loss of approximately $236 million and $220 million, respectively, on our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The loss from this hypothetical weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to translation as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the Euro. Translation from the Euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical 10% change in the Euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we designated €3.0 billion and €1.2 billion, respectively, of our Euro-denominated senior notes as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure from our net investment in Visa Europe. Foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the designated portion of the Euro-denominated senior notes partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from our net investment in Visa Europe. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13—Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties.47Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately $43 million and $47 million, respectively. Any realized losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. We have interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $40 million in annual interest expense for each fiscal year. See Note 13—Derivative and Hedging Instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.Equity Investment RiskOur equity investments are held in both marketable and non-marketable equity securities. The marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and the non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our marketable equity securities was $163 million and $291 million, respectively, and the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. These securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. A decline in financial condition or operating results of these investments could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in these companies. We regularly review our non-marketable equity securities for possible impairment, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and changes in circumstances influencing the investment, expectations of the entity’s cash flows and capital needs, and the viability of its business model.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:21:33.806301
