821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2006,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent strategy which focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long-term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common for 2005 of $1,252 million was up 104% compared to 2004 net income available to common of $614 million, attributable primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production. At December 31, 2005, EOG's total reserves were 6.2 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 548 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2004. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2005. United States and Canada. The Fort Worth, Texas office was opened in 2004 to expand on EOG's drilling success in the Barnett Shale play of the Fort Worth Basin. EOG has successfully expanded the play beyond its conventional limits by using horizontal drilling and enhanced completion technology. By year-end 2005, EOG had over 500,000 acres under lease in several counties. EOG plans on substantially increasing its drilling program in 2006. EOG's effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has several larger potential plays under way in Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Oklahoma and western Canada. International. During 2005, EOG commenced natural gas production in Trinidad to supply two new long-term contracts. First, EOG is supplying natural gas that is being used as feedstock for the M5000 methanol plant which commenced operations in September 2005. Second, the Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) began taking gas in December 2005, prior to commercial operations, and volumes supplied by EOG during this pre-start up period have been higher than EOG's contractual rate. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG sees an increasing linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidad natural gas supply. For example, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from existing and planned facilities in Trinidad are serious contenders to meet increasing United States demand. In addition, ammonia, methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the United States and Canada to Trinidad, driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation. EOG believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to the two ammonia plants, the new methanol plant and the ALNG, will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to United States and Canada natural gas fundamentals. In 2005, EOG continued its progress in the Southern Gas Basin of the United Kingdom North Sea. Production commenced in January 2005 from the Arthur 1 well and in July 2005 from the Arthur 2 well. The Arthur 3 well is expected to spud in the first half of 2006. EOG expects only modest activity in 2006 due to the difficulty in obtaining rigs in the North Sea. 22 Capital Structure As noted, one of management's key strategies is to keep a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2005, EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 19%, down from 27% at year-end 2004. By primarily utilizing cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from stock options exercised in 2005, EOG funded its $1,858 million exploration and development expenditures, paid down $93 million of debt and paid dividends to common shareholders of $36 million. In addition, in 2006, EOG's Board of Directors increased the cash dividend on common stock to an annual rate of $0.24 per share, which represents a 50% increase in the annual cash dividend. As management currently assesses price forecast and demand trends for 2006, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can essentially be funded by cash from operations. For 2006, EOG's estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately $2.5 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas continues to be a key component of this effort. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management believes that EOG continues to maintain one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. 23 Results of Operations Net Operating Revenues During 2005, net operating revenues increased $1,349 million to $3,620 million from $2,271 million in 2004. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, increased $1,306 million, or 57%, to $3,607 million as compared to $2,301 million in 2004. Natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids revenues solely represent wellhead revenues for these products. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 718 631 638 Canada 228 212 165 Trinidad 231 186 152 United Kingdom 39 7 - Total 1,216 1,036 955 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (2) United States $ 7.86 $ 5.72 $ 5.06 Canada 7.14 5.22 4.66 Trinidad 2.20 (3) 1.51 1.35 United Kingdom 6.99 5.14 - Composite 6.62 4.86 4.40 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 21.5 21.1 18.5 Canada 2.4 2.7 2.3 Trinidad 4.5 3.6 2.4 United Kingdom 0.2 - - Total 28.6 27.4 23.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 54.57 $ 40.73 $ 30.24 Canada 50.49 37.68 28.54 Trinidad 57.36 39.12 28.88 United Kingdom 49.62 - - Composite 54.63 40.22 29.92 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 6.6 4.8 3.2 Canada 0.9 0.8 0.6 Total 7.5 5.6 3.8 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 35.59 $ 27.79 $ 21.53 Canada 35.59 23.23 19.13 Composite 35.59 27.13 21.13 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (4) United States 886 786 768 Canada 248 233 183 Trinidad 259 207 166 United Kingdom 40 7 - Total 1,433 1,233 1,117 Total Bcfe (4) Deliveries 523.0 451.5 407.8 (1) Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

(4) Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. 24 2005 compared to 2004. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2005 increased $1,097 million, or 60%, to $2,939 million from $1,842 million for 2004 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($763 million), increased natural gas deliveries ($315 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take-or-pay contract ($19 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 36% to $6.62 per Mcf for 2005 from $4.86 per Mcf in 2004. Excluding the aforementioned adjustment, the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 35% to $6.58 per Mcf for 2005. This adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 180 MMcfd, or 17%, to 1,216 MMcfd for 2005 from 1,036 MMcfd in 2004. The increase was due to higher production of 87 MMcfd in the United States, 45 MMcfd in Trinidad, 32 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 16 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (63 MMcfd) and Louisiana (20 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants. The increase in the United Kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the Arthur field in January 2005 (24 MMcfd) and the full year production from the Valkyrie field, which commenced production in August 2004 (8 MMcfd). The increase in Canada was attributable to the drilling program, primarily in the Wapiti, Drumheller and Connorsville areas. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $168 million, or 42%, to $571 million from $403 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($151 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($17 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2005 was $54.63 per barrel compared to $40.22 per barrel for 2004. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $42 million, or 76%, to $97 million from $55 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in the composite average price ($23 million) and deliveries ($19 million). During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. 2004 compared to 2003. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2004 increased $307 million, or 20%, to $1,842 million from $1,535 million for 2003 due to increases in natural gas deliveries ($134 million) and the composite average wellhead natural gas price ($173 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 10% to $4.86 per Mcf for 2004 from $4.40 per Mcf in 2003. Natural gas deliveries increased 81 MMcfd, or 8%, to 1,036 MMcfd for 2004 from 955 MMcfd in 2003, due to a 47 MMcfd, or 28%, increase in Canada; a 34 MMcfd, or 22%, increase in Trinidad; and a 7 MMcfd increase in the United Kingdom due to commencement of production in August 2004, partially offset by a 7 MMcfd, or 1% decline in the United States. The increased deliveries in Canada (47 MMcfd) were attributable to property acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2003 and additional production related to post acquisition drilling. The increase in Trinidad was attributable to the increased production from the U(a) Block (22 MMcfd) which began supplying natural gas in mid-2004 to the N2000 ammonia plant and commencement of production from the Parula wells on the SECC Block in February 2004 (12 MMcfd). Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $149 million, or 59%, to $403 million from $254 million as compared to 2003, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($103 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($46 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2004 was $40.22 per barrel compared to $29.92 per barrel for 2003. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries increased 4.2 MBbld, or 18%, to 27.4 MBbld from 23.2 MBbld for 2003. The increase was mainly due to production from new wells in the United States (2.6 MBbld) and higher production in Trinidad from the Parula wells (0.8 MBbld) and from the U(a) Block as a result of new production (0.4 MBbld). Natural gas liquids revenues were $26 million higher than a year ago primarily due to increases in deliveries ($14 million) and the composite average price ($12 million). 25 During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark-to-market commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. During 2003, EOG recognized losses on mark-to-market commodity derivative contracts of $80 million, which included realized losses of $45 million and collar premium payments of $3 million. Operating and Other Expenses 2005 compared to 2004. During 2005, operating expenses of $1,628 million were $336 million higher than the $1,292 million incurred in 2004. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.71 $0.60 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) 1.25 1.12 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.24 0.25 Taxes Other Than Income 0.38 0.30 Interest Expense, Net 0.12 0.14 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $2.70 $2.41 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs and impairments. The per-unit costs of lease and well, including transportation, DD&A, taxes other than income and interest expense, net for 2005 compared to 2004 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expense includes expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expense can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, transportation costs associated with selling hydrocarbon products and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other service costs, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep, fuel and power. Workovers are costs to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses, including transportation, of $373 million were $102 million higher than 2004 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($40 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($28 million) and the United Kingdom ($7 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($11 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Trinidad ($2 million). DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact an individual field, such as the field production profile; drilling or acquisition of new wells; disposition of existing wells; reserve revisions (upward or downward), primarily related to well performance; and impairments. Changes to the individual fields, due to any of these factors, may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A expenses of $654 million were $150 million higher than 2004 primarily as a result of increased production in the United States ($46 million), Canada ($6 million) and Trinidad ($5 million) and the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($14 million). DD&A rates increased in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($59 million) and in Canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves ($9 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($8 million). 26 Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Taxes other than income of $199 million were $65 million higher than 2004. Severance/production taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($41 million), Trinidad ($7 million) and Canada ($3 million), partially offset by the increase in credits taken for a Texas high cost gas severance tax exemption ($10 million) and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million). Other items contributing to the increase were an additional Trinidadian Supplemental Petroleum Tax expense as a result of 2005 tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to January 2004 ($7 million) and 2004 production tax relief in Trinidad ($6 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($11 million). Net interest expense in 2005 included costs associated with the early retirement of 2008 Notes ($8 million) (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these early retirement costs, the 2005 net interest expense decreased $8 million compared to 2004 primarily due to higher capitalized interest ($5 million), an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($2 million) and lower average debt balance in the United States ($1 million). Exploration costs of $133 million were $39 million higher than 2004 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Barnett Shale area. Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"" which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long-lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $78 million were $4 million lower than 2004 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($12 million) and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain long-lived assets in Canada ($8 million), partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain long-lived assets in the United States ($14 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $31 million and $25 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for certain properties in the United States and Canada. Other income, net of $36 million increased $26 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties ($7 million), interest income ($6 million) and equity income from investments in the Caribbean Nitrogen Company Limited (CNCL) and Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited (N2000) ammonia plants in 2005 ($5 million); decreased net foreign currency transaction losses ($4 million); and a gain on the sale of part of EOG's interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in the first quarter of 2005 ($2 million). Income tax provision of $706 million increased $404 million as compared to 2004, due primarily to higher pre-tax income ($383 million) and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings ($24 million). The effective tax rate for 2005 increased to 36% from 33% in 2004. 2004 compared to 2003. During 2004, operating expenses of $1,292 million were $245 million higher than the $1,047 million incurred in 2003. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.60 $0.52 DD&A 1.12 1.08 G&A 0.25 0.25 Taxes Other Than Income 0.30 0.21 Interest Expense, Net 0.14 0.14 Total Per-Unit Costs $2.41 $2.20 The higher per-unit costs of lease and well, including transportation, DD&A and taxes other than income for 2004 compared to 2003 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. 27 Lease and well expenses, including transportation, of $271 million were $58 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a general increase in service costs related to increased operating activities, including an increase in the number of wells, in the United States ($18 million), Canada ($16 million), and Trinidad ($1 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($14 million), Canada ($2 million) and the United Kingdom ($2 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($5 million). DD&A expenses of $504 million increased $63 million from 2003 due primarily to increased production in Canada ($18 million), the United States ($10 million), and Trinidad ($4 million); the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($2 million); increased DD&A rates in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($13 million); increased DD&A rates in Canada mainly from developing acquired proved reserves ($8 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). G&A expenses of $115 million were $15 million higher than 2003 due primarily to expanded operations. Taxes other than income of $134 million were $48 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a decrease in credits taken against severance taxes resulting from the qualification of additional wells for a Texas high cost gas severance tax exemption ($19 million); an increase as a result of higher wellhead revenues in the United States ($13 million), Trinidad ($2 million) and Canada ($1 million); higher property taxes as a result of higher property valuation in the United States ($6 million); the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million); and an increase in the number of wells and facilities in Canada ($2 million). Exploration costs of $94 million were $18 million higher than 2003 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($6 million), Canada ($3 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Trinidad ($1 million); and increased exploration administrative expenses across EOG ($4 million). Impairments of $82 million were $8 million lower than 2003 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($10 million), partially offset by higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). Total impairments under SFAS No. 144 were $25 million in each of 2004 and 2003. Net interest expense of $63 million was $4 million higher than 2003 due primarily to a slightly higher average debt balance. Other income (expense), net for 2004 included income from equity investments of $11 million, gains on sales of reserves and related assets of $6 million and foreign currency transaction losses of $7 million as a result of applying the changes in the Canadian exchange rate to certain intercompany short-term loans that eliminate in consolidation. Income tax provision increased $85 million to $301 million compared to 2003, primarily resulting from higher income before income taxes ($95 million), offset by lower deferred income taxes associated with the Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate ($5 million) and lower effective foreign income tax rates ($2 million). The net effective tax rate for 2004 remained unchanged from the 2003 rate of 33%. In November 2003, Canada enacted legislation reducing the Canadian federal income tax rate for companies in the resource sector from 28% to 27% for 2003, with further reductions to 21% phased in over the next four years. This legislation also made changes to the tax treatment of crown royalties and the resource allowance. Beginning in 2003, Canadian taxpayers are allowed to deduct 10% of actual provincial and other crown royalties. This percentage increases each year through 2007, at which time 100% of crown royalties will be deductible. The resource allowance, a statutory deduction calculated as 25% of adjusted resource profits, will be phased out through 2007, when the deduction will be completely eliminated. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2005 included funds generated from operations, funds from new borrowings, proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties and proceeds from sales of partial interests in certain equity investments in Trinidad. Primary cash outflows included funds used in operations, exploration and development expenditures, oil and gas property acquisitions, repayment of debt, dividend payments to shareholders, redemption of preferred stock and common stock repurchases. 28 2005 compared to 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,369 million in 2005 increased $925 million as compared to 2004 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,306 million), a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($93 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($35 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($217 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($279 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,678 million in 2005 increased by $281 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($308 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($28 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in 2005 ($40 million) and the sale of part of EOG's interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in 2005 ($18 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $72 million in 2005 increased $29 million as compared to 2004. Cash provided by financing activities for 2005 included a long-term debt borrowing ($250 million) and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($65 million). Cash used by financing activities for 2005 included repayments of long-term debt borrowings ($343 million) and cash dividend payments ($43 million). 2004 compared to 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1,444 million in 2004 increased $195 million as compared to 2003 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues of $482 million, partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses of $139 million, an increase in current tax expense of $72 million, unfavorable changes in working capital and other liabilities of $48 million and an increase in realized losses from mark-to-market commodity derivative contracts of $38 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $1,397 million in 2004 increased by $189 million as compared to 2003 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties of $171 million and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities of $12 million. Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities was $43 million in 2004 versus $57 million in 2003. Cash provided by financing activities for 2004 included long-term debt borrowing of $150 million and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan of $76 million. Cash used by financing activities for 2004 included repayments of long-term debt borrowings of $175 million, redemption of all 500 outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock of $50 million and cash dividend payments of $38 million. 29 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures The table below sets out components of total exploration and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, along with the total budgeted for 2006, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2006 2005 2004 2003 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 1,458 $ 1,120 $ 731 Leasehold Acquisitions 131 143 59 Producing Property Acquisitions 56 52 405 Capitalized Interest 15 10 9 Subtotal 1,660 1,325 1,204 Exploration Costs 133 94 76 Dry Hole Costs 65 92 41 Exploration and Development Expenditures 1,858 1,511 1,321 Approximately $2,500 Asset Retirement Costs 20 16 12 (1) Deferred Income Tax on Acquired Properties - (17) - Total Exploration and Development Expenditures $ 1,878 $ 1,510 $ 1,333 (1) Asset Retirement Costs for 2003 does not include the cumulative effect of adoption of SFAS No. 143, ""Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations"" on January 1, 2003. Exploration and development expenditures of $1,858 million for 2005 were $347 million higher than the prior year due primarily to (i) increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $338 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($377 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate related to drilling and facilities expenditures ($17 million), partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United Kingdom ($24 million), Trinidad ($21 million) and Canada ($11 million) and; (ii) increased exploration costs ($39 million) primarily in the Barnett Shale area; partially offset by decreased dry hole costs ($27 million). The 2005 exploration and development expenditures of $1,858 million includes $1,300 million in development, $487 million in exploration, $56 million in property acquisitions and $15 million in capitalized interest. The 2004 exploration and development expenditures of $1,511 million includes $1,009 million in development, $440 million in exploration, $52 million in property acquisitions and $10 million in capitalized interest. The 2003 exploration and development expenditures of $1,321 million included $651 million in development, $256 million in exploration, $405 million in property acquisitions and $9 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. There are no material continuing commitments associated with current expenditure plans. 30 Derivative Transactions During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. (See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Presented below is a summary of EOG's 2006 natural gas financial collar and price swap contracts at February 22, 2006, with prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud). As indicated, EOG does not have any financial collar or price swap contracts that cover periods beyond October 2006. As of February 22, 2006, EOG had no crude oil hedges. EOG accounts for these collar and price swap contracts using mark-to-market accounting.

During 2005, total debt decreased $93 million to $985 million (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $1,025 million and $1,146 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates currently available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2005, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $46 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2005 and 2004, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations. While EOG maintains a $600 million commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2005 was $380 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $600 million Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, combined with approximately $688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. In 2005, the short-term commercial paper loan balance was reduced by $92 million; the $174 million, 6.00% Notes due 2008 and the remaining $75 million outstanding under the Senior Unsecured Term Loan Facility were repaid primarily with cash generated from operating activities. On February 17, 2006, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid $50 million of the $250 million it borrowed in 2005 (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2006, based on resources available at December 31, 2005, EOG plans to pay off the $126 million, 6.70% Notes due 2006. 31 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): 2012 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2006 2007 - 2009 2010 - 2011 Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $ 985,067 $ 126,075 $ 348,992 $ 220,000 $ 290,000 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 84,536 40,440 26,934 8,073 9,089 Interest Payments on Current and Long-Term Debt 420,466 58,944 126,424 63,670 171,428 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 273,185 40,752 93,065 59,081 80,287 Drilling Rig Commitments 182,955 75,624 107,331 - - Seismic Purchase Obligations 3,479 3,479 - - - Other Purchase Obligations 7,072 5,837 1,235 - - Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,956,760 $ 351,151 $ 703,981 $ 350,824 $ 550,804 (1) This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. Effective with adoption of SFAS No. 143, ""Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations"" on January 1, 2003, EOG recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation (see Note 13 to Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, this table does not include EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations (see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2005. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. Shelf Registration As of February 22, 2006, the amount available under various filed registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offer and sale from time to time of EOG debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock totaled approximately $688 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2005, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2005 was the Canadian Dollar. The continued strengthening of the Canadian Dollar in 2005 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 32 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2005, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $36 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This amount is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. In EOG's opinion, overall natural gas production in the United States is declining. In addition, the increasing recognition of natural gas as a more environmentally friendly source of energy is likely to result in increases in demand. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. Assuming a totally unhedged position for 2006, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2006 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in average wellhead natural gas price is approximately $24 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOG is not impacted as significantly by changing crude oil price. EOG's price sensitivity in 2006 for each $1.00 per barrel change in average wellhead crude oil prices is approximately $6 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOG's natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2005, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Marketing companies have played an important role in the United States and Canada natural gas market. These companies aggregate natural gas supplies through purchases from producers like EOG and then resell the gas to end users, local distribution companies or other buyers. In recent years, several of the largest natural gas marketing companies have filed for bankruptcy or are having financial difficulty, and others are exiting this business. EOG does not believe that this will have a material effect on its ability to market its natural gas production. EOG continues to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of partners to whom it sells its production and where appropriate, to seek new markets. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. However, in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the United States and Canada. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in other exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2006 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $2.5 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding the United States and Canada exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2006 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2006 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 33 Environmental Regulations Various federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOG's operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. All other exploratory wells that do not meet these criteria are expensed after one year. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. 34 Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property-by-property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depletion, depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, ""Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies."" The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and/or property dispositions, and 4) impairments. Stock Options EOG accounted for stock options under the provisions and related interpretations of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."" No compensation expense was recognized for such options. As allowed by SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"" issued in 1995, EOG continued to apply APB Opinion No. 25 for purposes of determining net income and to present the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. 35 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), ""Share-Based Payment,"" which supersedes SFAS No. 148, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123."" SFAS No. 123(R) establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. EOG adopted SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. EOG expects this will reduce 2006 net earnings by a pre-tax amount of approximately $25 million, taking into consideration the estimated forfeitures and cancellations. This amount includes approximately $21 million of expense for unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2005 and approximately $1 million of expense for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires a public entity to present its cash flows provided by tax benefits from stock options exercised in the Financing Cash Flows section of the Statement of Cash Flows. Had SFAS No. 123(R) been in effect, EOG's Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities would have been reduced and its Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities would have been increased on its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows by $51 million, $29 million and $12 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOG's future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports and changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOG's success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the availability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews, materials and equipment used in well completions, and tubular steel; the availability, terms and timing of governmental and other permits and rights of way; the availability of pipeline transportation capacity; the extent to which EOG can economically develop its Barnett Shale acreage outside of Johnson County, Texas; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; weather; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements might not occur. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 36 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk EOG's exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk is discussed in the Derivative Transactions, Financing, Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Outlook sections of ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.""",2023-12-30 20:17:35.163811
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2007,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Derivative Transactions. All of EOG's natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil, including blowouts, cratering and fires, each of which could result in damage to life and/or property. Offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. EOG's activities are also subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. In accordance with customary industry practices, insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of the risks. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. EOG's operations outside of the United States are subject to certain risks, including expropriation of assets, risks of increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments, political instability, payment delays, limits on allowable levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation losses, as well as changes in laws, regulations and policies governing operations of foreign companies. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 13 for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject. Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996, is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Taxes Other Than Income Taxes. Common Stock Rights Agreement. On February 14, 2000, EOG's Board of Directors (Board) declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right, and the agreement governing the terms of such Rights, the Rights Agreement) for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The Board has adopted this Rights Agreement to protect shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. The dividend was distributed to the shareholders of record on February 24, 2000. In accordance with the Rights Agreement, each share of common stock issued in connection with the two-for-one stock split effective March 1, 2005, also had one Right associated with it. Each Right, expiring February 24, 2010, represents a right to buy from EOG one hundredth (1/100) of a share of Series E Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Series E) for $90, once the Rights become exercisable. This portion of a Series E share will give the shareholder approximately the same dividend, voting, and liquidation rights as would one share of common stock. Prior to exercise, the Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, or liquidation rights. If issued, each one hundredth (1/100) of a Series E share (i) will not be redeemable; (ii) will entitle holders to quarterly dividend payments of $0.01 per share, or an amount equal to the dividend paid on one share of common stock, whichever is greater; (iii) will entitle holders upon liquidation either to receive $1 per share or an amount equal to the payment made on one share of common stock, whichever is greater; (iv) will have the same voting power as one share of common stock; and (v) if shares of EOG's common stock are exchanged via merger, consolidation, or a similar transaction, will entitle holders to a per share payment equal to the payment made on one share of common stock. The Rights will not be exercisable until ten days after a public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring person (Acquiring Person) by obtaining beneficial ownership of 10% or more of EOG's common stock, or if earlier, ten business days (or a later date determined by EOG's Board before any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person) after a person or group begins a tender or exchange offer which, if consummated, would result in that person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. On February 24, 2005, the Rights Agreement was amended to create an exception to the definition of Acquiring Person to permit a qualified institutional investor to hold 10% or more, but less than 20%, of EOG's common stock without being deemed an Acquiring Person if the institutional investor meets the following requirements: (i) the institutional investor is described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is eligible to report (and, if such institutional investor is the beneficial owner of greater than 5% of EOG's common stock, does in fact report) beneficial ownership of common stock on Schedule 13G; (ii) the institutional investor is not required to file a Schedule 13D (or any successor or comparable report) with respect to its beneficial ownership of EOG's common stock; (iii) the institutional investor does not beneficially own 15% or more of EOG's common stock (including in such calculation the holdings of all of the institutional investor's affiliates and associates other than those which, under published interpretations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff, are eligible to file separate reports on Schedule 13G with respect to their beneficial ownership of EOG's common stock); and (iv) the institutional investor does not beneficially own 20% or more of EOG's common stock (including in such calculation the holdings of all of the 10 institutional investor's affiliates and associates). On June 15, 2005, the Rights Agreement was amended again to revise the exception to the definition of Acquiring Person to permit a qualified institutional investor to hold 10% or more but less than 30% of EOG's common stock without being deemed an Acquiring Person if the institutional investor meets the other requirements of the definition of qualified institutional investor described in the amendment. If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, all holders of Rights, except the Acquiring Person may, for $90, purchase shares of EOG's common stock with a market value of $180 based on the market price of the common stock prior to such acquisition. If EOG is later acquired in a merger or similar transaction after the Rights become exercisable, all holders of Rights except the Acquiring Person may, for $90, purchase shares of the acquiring corporation with a market value of $180 based on the market price of the acquiring corporation's stock prior to such merger. EOG's Board may redeem the Rights for $0.005 per Right at any time before any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person. If the Board redeems any Rights, it must redeem all of the Rights. Once the Rights are redeemed, the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the redemption price of $0.005 per Right. The redemption price has been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split effective March 1, 2005 and will be adjusted for any future stock split or stock dividends of EOG's common stock. After a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, but before an Acquiring Person owns 50% or more of EOG's outstanding common stock, the Board may exchange the Rights for common stock or equivalent security at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock or an equivalent security for each such Right, other than Rights held by the Acquiring Person. Preferred Stock. EOG currently has two authorized series of preferred stock. On February 14, 2000, EOG's Board, in connection with the Rights Agreement described above, authorized 1,500,000 shares of the Series E with the rights and preferences described above. On February 24, 2005, EOG's Board increased the authorized shares of Series E to 3,000,000 as a result of the two-for-one stock split of EOG's common stock effective March 1, 2005. Currently, there are no shares of the Series E outstanding. On July 19, 2000, EOG's Board authorized 100,000 shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 Liquidation Preference per share (Series B). Dividends are payable on the shares only if declared by EOG's Board and will be cumulative. If declared, dividends will be payable at a rate of $71.95 per share, per year on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year beginning September 15, 2000. EOG may redeem all or part of the Series B at any time beginning on December 15, 2009 at $1,000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series B is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, common stock of EOG. On October 11, 2006, EOG commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100,000 outstanding shares of the Series B at a price of $1,074.01 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase.

Risk Factors Our business faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. A substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us. Prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely. Since we are primarily a natural gas company, we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. Among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are: the level of consumer demand;weather conditions;domestic drilling activity;the price and availability of alternative fuels, including liquefied natural gas;the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities;worldwide economic and political conditions;the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures; andthe nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets. Our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing. The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. Any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities or our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. We deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons, or may not be available to us in the future. Weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity. Demand for natural gas and oil is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be misstated. Estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be overstated or understated. To prepare estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs. Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves. 13 If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Future crude oil and natural gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reservoirs. We may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. The presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions;title problems;pressure or irregularities in formations;equipment failures or accidents;adverse weather conditions;compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, which may increase our costs or restrict our activities; costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, tubular materials and equipment;lack of infrastructure; andlack of trained drilling personnel. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by other governments/authorities in countries in which we do business. We have and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations. Further, the crude oil and natural gas industry regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs. As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could hurt our business. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities. The exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, injure or kill people, and damage property and the environment. Offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions, and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce our revenues and increase our costs to the extent not covered by insurance. 14 The occurrence of any of these events and any costs incurred as a result of such events and the liabilities related thereto, would reduce the funds available for exploration, drilling and production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks. From time to time, we use derivative instruments (primarily collars and price swaps) to hedge the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude oil prices on net income and cash flow. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations, particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver oil and gas volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed. If we acquire oil and gas properties, our failure to fully identify potential problems, to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could seriously harm us. From time to time, we seek to acquire oil and gas properties. Although we perform reviews of acquired properties that we believe are consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, acquisitions may have adverse effects on our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could adversely affect our business. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as the military or other actions taken in response to these acts, cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The United States government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These actions could adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices, or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terror. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate those properties and the marketing of crude oil and natural gas production. Higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas production, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, development, production, exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations, commercial paper and to a lesser extent and if necessary, bank borrowings, public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, would 15 reduce our cash flow. Further, if the condition of the capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable. In addition, a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Properties and Reserves Reserve Information. For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, see Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. In general, production from EOG's oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. Volumes generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 Acreage.

On January 31, 2007, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $0.06 per share to $0.09 per share. As of February 16, 2007, there were approximately 260 record holders of EOG's common stock, including individual participants in security position listings. There are an estimated 123,000 beneficial owners of EOG's common stock, including shares held in street name. EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock. However, the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other things, the financial condition, funds from operations, level of exploration, exploitation and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of EOG.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long-term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common for 2006 of $1,289 million was up 3% compared to 2005 net income available to common of $1,252 million. At December 31, 2006, EOG's total reserves were 6.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 607 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2005. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2006. United States and Canada. EOG's effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's crude oil and natural gas production. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 79% of total company production in both 2006 and 2005. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2007 production profile to be similar. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. International. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG sees an increasing linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidad natural gas supply. For example, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from existing and planned facilities in Trinidad are contenders to meet increasing United States natural gas demand. In addition, ammonia, methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the United States and Canada to Trinidad, driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation. EOG believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to two ammonia plants, a methanol plant and the Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) plant will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to United States and Canada natural gas fundamentals. Beginning December 2005, ALNG began taking start-up gas and remained in the start-up phase through December 2006. In the first quarter of 2006, a subsidiary of EOG, EOG Resources Trinidad Block 4(a) Unlimited, drilled two successful wells on Block 4(a). The subsidiary obtained approval to develop Block 4(a) under a production sharing contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago signed in July 2005. A subsidiary of EOG, EOG Resources Trinidad Limited, and the other participants in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block signed a farm-out agreement covering the SECC Deep Ibis prospect with BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC (BP) during 2004. The SECC Deep Ibis well spud in April 2006, was drilled to a depth of approximately 19,000 feet and was abandoned and classified as a dry hole in the third quarter of 2006. BP paid the entire cost for drilling the SECC Deep Ibis exploratory well. During 2006, notwithstanding difficulties in accessing rig slots in the Southern Gas Basin of the United Kingdom North Sea, Arthur 3 was drilled and completed and began producing in early third quarter. In addition to EOG's ongoing production from Valkyrie and Arthur Fields, EOG participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. The Columbus well was a farm-in opportunity, and its future appraisal and development is currently being evaluated. 21 Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. At December 31, 2006, EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 12%, down from 19% at year-end 2005. By primarily utilizing cash on hand and cash provided from its operating activities, EOG funded its $2,974 million exploration and development expenditures, paid down $317 million of debt, paid dividends to common shareholders of $60 million and redeemed $47 million of preferred stock. As management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for 2007, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations. For 2007, EOG's estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately $3.4 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. On September 15, 2006, EOG filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (New Registration Statement) for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $688,237,500 of EOG's debt securities, preferred stock and common stock. The New Registration Statement was filed to replace EOG's existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2000, under which EOG had sold no securities. As of February 26, 2007, the entire amount registered remains available under the New Registration Statement. On October 11, 2006, EOG commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100,000 outstanding shares of the 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 Liquidation Preference per share (Series B), at a price of $1,074.01 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase. The tender offer expired on November 8, 2006, and on November 10, 2006, EOG redeemed 46,740 shares of the Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including redemption premium, fees and dividends, of $51 million. EOG has included as a component of preferred dividends the $4 million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the Series B shares. A total of 53,260 shares of the Series B remain outstanding at December 31, 2006. Stock-Based Compensation. EOG adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), ""Share-Based Payment"" effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective application method and accordingly has not restated any of its prior year results. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), EOG recognized compensation expense for its stock-based compensation plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."" Stock-based compensation expense prior to January 1, 2006 consisted of amounts recognized in connection with grants of restricted stock and units. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in EOG recognizing compensation expense on grants made under its employee stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan. For periods subsequent to January 1, 2006, stock-based compensation expense is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income based upon job functions of employees receiving the grants. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, EOG compensation expense related to its stock-based compensation plans was as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Lease and Well $ 10 $ - $ - Exploration Costs 11 - - General and Administrative 29 12 10 Total $ 50 $ 12 $ 10 22 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2006, net operating revenues increased $284 million, or 8%, to $3,904 million from $3,620 million in 2005. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, decreased $42 million, or 1%, to $3,565 million from $3,607 million in 2005. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 817 718 631 Canada 226 228 212 Trinidad 264 231 186 United Kingdom 30 39 7 Total 1,337 1,216 1,036 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (2) United States $ 6.56 $ 7.86 $ 5.72 Canada 6.41 7.14 5.22 Trinidad 2.44 2.20 (4) 1.51 United Kingdom 7.69 6.99 5.14 Composite 5.74 6.62 4.86 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 20.7 21.5 21.1 Canada 2.5 2.4 2.7 Trinidad 4.8 4.5 3.6 United Kingdom 0.1 0.2 - Total 28.1 28.6 27.4 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 62.68 $ 54.57 $ 40.73 Canada 57.32 50.49 37.68 Trinidad 63.87 57.36 39.12 United Kingdom 57.74 49.62 - Composite 62.38 54.63 40.22 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 8.5 6.6 4.8 Canada 0.8 0.9 0.8 Total 9.3 7.5 5.6 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (2) United States $ 39.95 $ 35.59 $ 27.79 Canada 43.69 35.59 23.23 Composite 40.25 35.59 27.13 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (3) United States 992 886 786 Canada 246 248 233 Trinidad 292 259 207 United Kingdom 31 40 7 Total 1,561 1,433 1,233 Total Bcfe (3) Deliveries 569.9 523.0 451.5 (1) Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

(3) Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. (4) Includes $0.23 per Mcf as a result of a revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take-or-pay contract. 23 2006 compared to 2005. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2006 decreased $136 million, or 5%, to $2,803 million from $2,939 million for 2005 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($407 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take-or-pay contract ($19 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($290 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 13% to $5.74 per Mcf for 2006 from $6.62 per Mcf in 2005. The Trinidad take-or-pay contract adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 121 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,337 MMcfd for 2006 from 1,216 MMcfd in 2005. The increase was due to higher production of 99 MMcfd in the United States and 33 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 9 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (83 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (24 MMcfd) and Kansas (7 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in the Gulf of Mexico (16 MMcfd). The decrease in Gulf of Mexico production was partially due to continued shut-in production caused by infrastructure damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in Trinidad was due to the commencement of two contracts late in the fourth quarter of 2005 (43 MMcfd) and increased contractual demand (34 MMcfd), partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the December 2005 completion of a cost recovery arrangement (44 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $54 million, or 9%, to $625 million from $571 million as compared to 2005, due to an increase in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($78 million), partially offset by a decrease in the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($24 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2006 was $62.38 per barrel compared to $54.63 per barrel for 2005. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $40 million, or 41%, to $137 million from $97 million as compared to 2005, due to increases in deliveries ($24 million) and the composite average price ($16 million). During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. 2005 compared to 2004. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2005 increased $1,097 million, or 60%, to $2,939 million from $1,842 million for 2004 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($763 million), increased natural gas deliveries ($315 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take-or-pay contract ($19 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 36% to $6.62 per Mcf for 2005 from $4.86 per Mcf in 2004. Excluding the aforementioned adjustment, the composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 35% to $6.58 per Mcf for 2005. This adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 180 MMcfd, or 17%, to 1,216 MMcfd for 2005 from 1,036 MMcfd in 2004. The increase was due to higher production of 87 MMcfd in the United States, 45 MMcfd in Trinidad, 32 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 16 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (63 MMcfd) and Louisiana (20 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was due to the increased contractual requirements and demand related to the ammonia and methanol plants. The increase in the United Kingdom was due to the commencement of production from the Arthur field in January 2005 (24 MMcfd) and the full year production from the Valkyrie field, which commenced production in August 2004 (8 MMcfd). The increase in Canada was attributable to the drilling program, primarily in the Wapiti, Drumheller and Connorsville areas. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $168 million, or 42%, to $571 million from $403 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in both the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($151 million) and the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($17 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2005 was $54.63 per barrel compared to $40.22 per barrel for 2004. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $42 million, or 76%, to $97 million from $55 million as compared to 2004, due to increases in the composite average price ($23 million) and deliveries ($19 million). 24 During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. During 2004, EOG recognized losses on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $33 million, which included realized losses of $82 million and collar premium payments of $1 million. Operating and Other Expenses 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, operating expenses of $2,009 million were $381 million higher than the $1,628 million incurred in 2005. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 Lease and Well $0.66 $0.54 Transportation Costs 0.19 0.17 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) 1.44 1.25 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.29 0.24 Taxes Other Than Income 0.35 0.38 Net Interest Expense 0.08 0.12 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $3.01 $2.70 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs and impairments. The change in per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A, taxes other than income and net interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep, and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $373 million in 2006 were $86 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($34 million) and Canada ($16 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses ($21 million), including stock-based compensation expense ($10 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($6 million). Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third-party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a down-stream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs and transportation fees. Transportation costs of $110 million in 2006 were $23 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles; drilling or acquisition of new wells; disposition of existing wells; reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance; and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. 25 DD&A expenses of $817 million in 2006 were $163 million higher than 2005 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($56 million) and Trinidad ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($4 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($78 million) and Canada ($11 million), and a downward reserve revision in the United Kingdom ($11 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($9 million). G&A expenses of $165 million in 2006 were $39 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($31 million) and higher insurance costs ($4 million). The increase in employee-related costs primarily reflects higher stock-based compensation expenses ($17 million). Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Taxes other than income of $201 million in 2006 were $2 million higher than 2005. Severance taxes in the United States decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($14 million). Severance/production taxes in Trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate ($12 million), partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the Supplemental Petroleum Tax ($7 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($7 million) and Canada ($2 million). Net interest expense of $43 million in 2006 decreased $19 million compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average debt balance ($9 million), costs in 2005 associated with the early retirement of the 6.00% Notes due 2008 ($8 million), and higher capitalized interest ($5 million). Exploration costs of $155 million in 2006 were $22 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses. Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under SFAS No. 144, ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"" which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long-lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $108 million in 2006 were $30 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments in the United States ($17 million) and Canada ($7 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($4 million) and the United States ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $55 million and $31 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for properties in the United States and Canada. Other income, net was $60 million in 2006 compared to $36 million in 2005. The increase of $24 million was primarily due to higher interest income ($19 million), settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($4 million) and increased net foreign currency transaction gains ($3 million), partially offset by lower gains on sales of properties ($5 million). Income tax provision of $613 million in 2006 decreased $93 million compared to 2005 due primarily to a net decrease in foreign income taxes ($37 million), largely related to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction ($19 million) and an Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate reduction ($13 million), partially offset by a United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase ($7 million); reduced income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 ($24 million); decreased pretax income ($18 million); and reduced state income taxes ($18 million), partially offset by a decrease in the Domestic Production Activities Deduction ($7 million). The effective tax rate for 2006 decreased to 32% from 36% in 2005. 26 2005 compared to 2004. During 2005, operating expenses of $1,628 million were $336 million higher than the $1,292 million incurred in 2004. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Lease and Well, including Transportation $0.71 $0.60 DD&A 1.25 1.12 G&A 0.24 0.25 Taxes Other Than Income 0.38 0.30 Interest Expense, Net 0.12 0.14 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $2.70 $2.41 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs and impairments. The per-unit rates of lease and well, including transportation, DD&A, taxes other than income and interest expense, net for 2005 compared to 2004 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses, including transportation, of $373 million were $102 million higher than 2004 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($40 million); increased transportation related costs in the United States ($28 million) and the United Kingdom ($7 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($11 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Trinidad ($2 million). DD&A expenses of $654 million in 2005 were $150 million higher than 2004 primarily as a result of increased production in the United States ($46 million), Canada ($6 million) and Trinidad ($5 million) and the commencement of production in the United Kingdom ($14 million). DD&A rates increased in the United States due to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties ($59 million) and in Canada predominantly from the development of acquired proved reserves ($9 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($8 million). Taxes other than income of $199 million in 2005 were $65 million higher than 2004. Severance/production taxes increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($41 million), Trinidad ($7 million) and Canada ($3 million), partially offset by the increase in credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($10 million) and a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($5 million). Other items contributing to the increase were an additional Trinidadian Supplemental Petroleum Tax expense as a result of 2005 tax legislation that increased the tax expense retroactively to January 2004 ($7 million) and 2004 production tax relief in Trinidad ($6 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($11 million). Net interest expense in 2005 included costs associated with the early retirement of the 2008 Notes ($8 million) (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding these early retirement costs, the 2005 net interest expense decreased $8 million compared to 2004 primarily due to higher capitalized interest ($5 million), an interest charge related to the results of a production tax audit lawsuit in the first quarter of 2004 ($2 million) and lower average debt balance in the United States ($1 million). Exploration costs of $133 million in 2005 were $39 million higher than 2004 due primarily to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. Impairments of $78 million were $4 million lower than 2004 due primarily to lower amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($12 million) and lower impairments to the carrying value of certain long-lived assets in Canada ($8 million), partially offset by higher impairments to the carrying value of certain long-lived assets in the United States ($14 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $31 million and $25 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for certain properties in the United States and Canada. Other income, net of $36 million in 2005 increased $26 million compared to 2004 primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of properties ($7 million), interest income ($6 million) and equity income from investments in the Caribbean Nitrogen Company Limited (CNCL) and Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited (N2000) ammonia plants in 2005 27 ($5 million); decreased net foreign currency transaction losses ($4 million); and a gain on the sale of part of EOG's interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in the first quarter of 2005 ($2 million). Income tax provision of $706 million increased $404 million as compared to 2004, due primarily to higher pretax income ($383 million) and income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings ($24 million). The effective tax rate for 2005 increased to 36% from 33% in 2004. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2006 included funds generated from operations, funds from new borrowings, proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan, and proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations, exploration and development expenditures, repayment of debt, dividend payments to shareholders and redemption of preferred stock. 2006 compared to 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,579 million in 2006 increased $209 million compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($205 million), favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($162 million) and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest expense ($54 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($173 million) and a decrease in wellhead revenues ($42 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $2,710 million in 2006 increased by $1,032 million compared to 2005 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($1,094 million) and decreased proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties ($51 million), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($125 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $299 million in 2006 increased $227 million compared to 2005. Cash used by financing activities for 2006 included repayments of long-term debt borrowings ($317 million), cash dividend payments ($60 million) and redemption of preferred stock, including premium paid ($50 million). Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 included borrowing under a revolving credit facility ($65 million), proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($36 million) and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expenses ($28 million). 2005 compared to 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,369 million in 2005 increased $925 million as compared to 2004 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,306 million), a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($93 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($35 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($217 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($279 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $1,678 million in 2005 increased by $281 million as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($308 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($28 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties in 2005 ($40 million) and the sale of part of EOG's interest in the N2000 ammonia plant in 2005 ($18 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $72 million in 2005 increased $29 million as compared to 2004. Cash provided by financing activities for 2005 included a long-term debt borrowing ($250 million) and proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($65 million). Cash used by financing activities for 2005 included repayments of long-term debt borrowings ($343 million) and cash dividend payments ($43 million). 28 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures The table below sets out components of total exploration and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, along with the total budgeted for 2007, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2007 2006 2005 2004 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 2,472 $ 1,458 $ 1,120 Leasehold Acquisitions 225 131 143 Producing Property Acquisitions 22 56 52 Capitalized Interest 20 15 10 Subtotal 2,739 1,660 1,325 Exploration Costs 155 133 94 Dry Hole Costs 80 65 92 Exploration and Development Expenditures 2,974 1,858 1,511 Approximately $3,400 Asset Retirement Costs 22 20 16 Deferred Income Tax on Acquired Properties - - (17) Total Exploration and Development Expenditures $ 2,996 $ 1,878 $ 1,510 Exploration and development expenditures of $2,974 million for 2006 were $1,116 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $1,014 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($843 million), Trinidad ($79 million), Canada ($57 million) and the United Kingdom ($13 million); increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($74 million) and Canada ($16 million); and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($28 million). The 2006 exploration and development expenditures of $2,974 million includes $2,228 million in development, $704 million in exploration, $22 million in property acquisitions and $20 million in capitalized interest. The 2005 exploration and development expenditures of $1,858 million includes $1,300 million in development, $487 million in exploration, $56 million in property acquisitions and $15 million in capitalized interest. The 2004 exploration and development expenditures of $1,511 million includes $1,009 million in development, $440 million in exploration, $52 million in property acquisitions and $10 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. (See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 29 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's 2007 natural gas and crude oil financial price swap contracts at February 26, 2007, with prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl), as applicable, and notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and in barrels per day (Bbld), as applicable. Currently, EOG is not a party to any financial collar contracts. EOG accounts for these price swap contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method. Financial Price Swap Contracts Natural Gas Crude Oil Weighted Weighted Volume Average Price Volume Average Price Month (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) (Bbld) ($/Bbl) January (closed) 120,000 $10.91 4,000 $78.42 February (1) 120,000 10.93 4,000 78.55 March 120,000 10.75 4,000 78.58 April 120,000 8.81 4,000 78.57 May 120,000 8.65 4,000 78.50 June 120,000 8.74 4,000 78.40 July 120,000 8.84 4,000 78.28 August 120,000 8.92 4,000 78.16 September 120,000 9.00 4,000 78.03 October 120,000 9.14 4,000 77.91 November 120,000 9.94 4,000 77.75 December 120,000 10.70 4,000 77.57 (1) The natural gas contracts for February 2007 are closed. The crude oil contracts for February 2007 will close on February 28, 2007. Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 12% as of December 31, 2006 compared to 19% as of December 31, 2005. During 2006, total debt decreased $252 million to $733 million (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $754 million and $1,025 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2006, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $39 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2006 and 2005, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations. While EOG maintains a $600 million commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2006 was $172 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $600 million Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, combined with approximately $688 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. During 2006, EOG repaid the $126 million, 6.70% Notes due in 2006 primarily with cash generated from operating activities. In 2006, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid $190 million of the $250 million borrowed in 2005 (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The foreign subsidiary has the option to pay off the remaining $60 million of the $250 million borrowed in 2005 at any time prior to maturity. EOG plans to replace the $98 million, 6.50% Notes due 2007 with other long-term debt. On October 11, 2006, EOG commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the 100,000 outstanding shares of the 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 Liquidation Preference per share (Series B), at a price of $1,074.01 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase. The tender offer expired on November 8, 2006, and on November 10, 2006, EOG redeemed 46,740 shares of the Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including redemption premium, fees and dividends, of 30 $51 million. EOG has included as a component of preferred dividends the $4 million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the Series B shares. A total of 53,260 shares of the Series B remain outstanding at December 31, 2006. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): 2013 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2007 2008 - 2010 2011 - 2012 Beyond Long-Term Debt $ 733,442 $ - $ 125,000 $ 318,442 $ 290,000 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 189,533 17,627 50,927 29,141 91,838 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 351,416 45,441 102,712 48,270 154,993 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 1,675,148 78,005 478,822 342,990 775,331 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 472,253 229,991 240,372 1,890 - Seismic Purchase Obligations 2,322 2,322 - - - Other Purchase Obligations 36,602 35,916 686 - - Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,460,716 $ 409,302 $ 998,519 $ 740,733 $ 1,312,162 (1) This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. In addition, this table does not include EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations (see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2006. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Shelf Registration On September 15, 2006, EOG filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (New Registration Statement) for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $688,237,500 of EOG's debt securities, preferred stock and common stock. The New Registration Statement was filed to replace EOG's existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the SEC in October 2000, under which EOG had sold no securities. As of February 26, 2007, the entire amount registered remains available under the New Registration Statement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other off-balance sheet arrangements during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions or arrangements in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2006, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2006 was the Canadian Dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian Dollar in 2006 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 31 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2006, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $36 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. This amount is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Shareholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. Assuming a totally unhedged position for 2007, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2007 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $27 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOG's price sensitivity in 2007 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price is approximately $6 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOG's natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of December 31, 2006, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. However, in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the United States and Canada. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities. Budgeted 2007 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $3.4 billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in 2007 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2007 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such 32 laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOG's operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property-by-property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future 33 undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depletion, depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, ""Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies."" The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and/or property dispositions, and 4) impairments. Stock-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, EOG accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), ""Share Based Payment."" SFAS No. 123(R) requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award, eliminating the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under APB Opinion No. 25, ""Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."" In applying the provisions of SFAS 123(R), judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 34 Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOG's future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports and changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOG's success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the availability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews, materials and equipment used in well completions, and tubular steel; the availability, terms and timing of governmental and other permits and rights of way; the availability of pipeline transportation capacity; the availability of compression uplift capacity; the extent to which EOG can economically develop its Barnett Shale acreage outside of Johnson County, Texas; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; weather; and financial market conditions. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements might not occur. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 35 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk EOG's exposure to commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk is discussed in the Derivative Transactions, Financing, Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Outlook sections of ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.""",2023-12-30 20:17:39.308203
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2008,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. All of EOG's natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil, including blowouts, cratering and fires, each of which could result in damage to life and/or property. Offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. EOG's activities are also subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. In accordance with customary industry practices, insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of the risks. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. EOG's operations outside of the United States are subject to certain risks, including expropriation of assets, risks of increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments, political instability, payment delays, limits on allowable levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation losses, as well as changes in laws, regulations and policies governing operations of foreign companies. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject. Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996, is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of 11 production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7.

The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. A substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us. Prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely. Since we are primarily a natural gas company, we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. Among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are: the level of consumer demand; weather conditions; domestic drilling activity; the price and availability of alternative fuels, including liquefied natural gas; the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities; worldwide economic and political conditions; the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures; and the natural and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including environmental regulations. Our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. Prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures, our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. Our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially affected if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing. The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. Moreover, we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own, and these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons, or may not be available to us in the future. Any significant change in market factors affecting these facilities, the availability of these facilities or our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity. Demand for natural gas and crude oil is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and sea level changes associated with climate change, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. Extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs and the installation of new facilities. Such extreme weather conditions and changes associated with climate change could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be misstated. Estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes in conditions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. 13 To prepare estimates of economically recoverable natural gas and crude oil reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs. Our actual proved reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities, acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Our future natural gas and crude oil production, specifically maintaining our production at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. Drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control. Drilling natural gas and crude oil wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs. As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. The presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents, among other factors, may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a partial or total loss of our investment. In addition, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, as our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, and the cost of such operations may increase, as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, which may increase our costs or restrict our activities; costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, tubular materials and equipment; lack of infrastructure; and lack of trained drilling personnel. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, especially regulations relating to environmental protection, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in foreign countries in which we do business. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the natural gas and crude oil industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance. As an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Changes in, or additions to, regulations regarding the protection of the environment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 EOG is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation, recently proposed by the Canadian legislature, to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, proposed United States policy, legislation or regulatory actions may also address GHG emissions. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities. The exploration for, and production of, natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, injure or kill people, and damage property and the environment. Moreover, our offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions, and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling and production and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks. From time to time, we use derivative instruments (primarily collars and price swaps) to hedge the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude oil prices on our net income and cash flow. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations, particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver natural gas and crude oil volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed. If we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties, our failure to fully identify potential problems, to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired that we believe are consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves, actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, acquisitions may have material and adverse effects on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The United States government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets, increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices, or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of natural gas and crude oil leases, properties and reserves, equipment and labor required to explore, develop and operate those properties and the marketing of natural gas and crude oil production. Higher recent natural gas and crude oil prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition, and there are several companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. We also compete with our competitors in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, development, production, exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations and commercial paper borrowings and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower natural gas and crude oil prices, however, would reduce our cash flow. Further, if the condition of the capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable. The recent credit crisis triggered by the subprime mortgage markets and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk, generally, may increase the interest rates that the lenders require us to pay. In addition, a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the United States and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the value has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 15% of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves Reserve Information. For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, see Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements represent only estimates. 16 Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. In general, production from EOG's natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. Volumes generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2007. Excluded is acreage in which EOG's interest is limited to owned royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low price per share for the common stock of EOG, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape, and the amount of common stock dividend declared per share. Price Range High Low Dividend Declared 2007 First Quarter $ 73.09 $ 59.21 $ 0.09 Second Quarter 81.49 71.15 0.09 Third Quarter 76.92 65.29 0.09 Fourth Quarter 91.63 72.20 0.09 2006 First Quarter $ 86.91 $ 64.12 $ 0.06 Second Quarter 79.24 56.31 0.06 Third Quarter 75.56 58.45 0.06 Fourth Quarter 72.27 59.88 0.06 On January 31, 2007, EOG's Board of Directors (Board) increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $0.06 per share to $0.09 per share. On February 7, 2008, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $0.09 per share to $0.12 per share. As of February 15, 2008, there were approximately 250 record holders of EOG's common stock, including individual participants in security position listings. There are an estimated 157,000 beneficial owners of EOG's common stock, including shares held in street name. EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock. However, the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other things, the financial condition, funds from operations, level of exploration, exploitation and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of EOG. 19 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, EOG's share repurchase activity: Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased(1) (b) Average Price Paid per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs(2) October 1, 2007 - October 31, 2007 9,117 $85.32 - 6,386,200 November 1, 2007 - November 30, 2007 2,585 87.29 - 6,386,200 December 1, 2007 - December 31, 2007 1,574 87.35 - 6,386,200 Total 13,276 85.94 (1) The quarterly total number of shares of 13,276 consists solely of zero shares (15,558 shares for the full year 2007) that were returned to EOG in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options and 13,276 shares (110,895 shares for the full year 2007) that were withheld by or returned to EOG to satisfy tax withholding obligations that arose upon the exercise of employee stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights or the vesting of restricted stock or units. (2) In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of EOG's common stock. During 2007, EOG did not repurchase any shares under the Board authorized repurchase program. 20 Comparative Stock Performance The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed ""soliciting material"" or to be ""filed"" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that EOG specifically incorporates such information by reference into such a filing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, offshore Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long-term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common stockholders for 2007 of $1,083 million was down 16% compared to 2006 net income available to common stockholders of $1,289 million. At December 31, 2007, EOG's total reserves were 7.7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 944 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2006. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2007. United States and Canada. EOG's effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's natural gas and crude oil production. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 83% of total company production in 2007 as compared to 79% in 2006. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2008 production profile to be similar. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. In December 2007, EOG entered into an agreement to sell the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the Appalachian Basin to a subsidiary of EXCO Resources, Inc., an independent oil and gas company, for approximately $395 million, subject to customary adjustments under the agreement. The Appalachian area being divested includes approximately 2,400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1% of EOG's total 2007 production and approximately 2% of its total year-end 2007 proved reserves. The transaction closed on February 20, 2008. EOG retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area, including rights in the Marcellus Shale, and will continue its shale exploration program. On December 31, 2007, the book value of the assets and liabilities included in the sale were $254 million and $9 million, respectively. International. Although EOG continues to focus on United States and Canada natural gas, EOG continues to see linkage between United States and Canada natural gas demand and Trinidad natural gas supply. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Under the Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) contract, EOG delivered gas at the contractual rate of 30 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd), gross (12 MMcfd, net) beginning in May 2007 when the ALNG plant reached commercial status. In March 2007, EOG acquired the remaining 10% working interest from Primera Block 4(a) Limited, a Trinidadian company, and now holds a 100% working interest in Block 4(a). In July 2007, EOG executed a 15-year natural gas contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) for the sale of approximately 100 MMcfd, gross (78 MMcfd, net to EOG, based on current pricing and operating assumptions). EOG expects to begin initial delivery under this contract in early 2010 from its first discovery on Block 4(a), subject to the completion of a pipeline by NGC. In May 2007, EOG acquired the remainder of the interest in the Modified U(b) Block from Primera Oil & Gas Ltd., a Trinidadian company, and now holds a 100% working interest in the Modified U(b) Block. In August 2007, EOG drilled the U(b)-2 exploratory well on the Modified U(b) Block, and the well was determined to be non-commercial. In 2007, EOG agreed to purchase an 80% interest in the Pelican field facilities from the subsidiaries of the other participants in the South East Coast Consortium Block. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008. During 2007, EOG executed a one-year term sheet, effective July 1, 2007, with the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago that sets forth the pricing for the sales of crude oil and condensate produced in Trinidad. The pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin. This term sheet replaces the pricing provisions of a previous crude oil and condensate sales contract 23 that expired on June 30, 2007 and will be incorporated into a new crude oil and condensate sales contract which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2008. In addition to EOG's ongoing production from the Valkyrie and Arthur Fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, EOG participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f, at the end of 2006. In 2007, a successful appraisal well was drilled on this prospect. The future development of this prospect is currently being evaluated. EOG also participated in the drilling of an unsuccessful exploratory well in August 2007 on the Eos prospect located in the Southern North Sea Block 45/11c. EOG continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified. Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. At December 31, 2007, EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 14%, up from 12% at year-end 2006. By primarily utilizing cash on hand, cash provided from its operating activities and proceeds from long-term debt borrowings, EOG funded $3.9 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures, paid down $158 million of debt, paid dividends to common and preferred stockholders of $84 million and paid $51 million for the redemption of preferred stock. As management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for 2008, EOG believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations. For 2008, EOG's budget for exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures is approximately $4.4 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. On September 10, 2007, EOG completed its public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 (2017 Notes). Interest on the 2017 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2008. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $595 million and were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. On September 15, 2006, EOG filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (New Registration Statement) for the offer and sale from time to time of up to $688,237,500 of EOG's debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock. The New Registration Statement was filed to replace EOG's then existing shelf registration statement which had been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October 2000 and under which EOG had sold no securities. As of December 31, 2007, and as a result of the issuance of the 2017 Notes, EOG may offer and sell up to $88,237,500 of debt securities, preferred stock and/or common stock under the New Registration Statement. In 2007, EOG repurchased a total of 48,260 shares of its outstanding 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share (Series B), for an aggregate purchase price, including premium and fees, of $51 million, plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase. EOG has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the $3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases. At December 31, 2007, 5,000 shares of the Series B with a book value of $5 million remained outstanding. Such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in January 2008. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 24 Stock-Based Compensation. EOG adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), ""Share-Based Payment"" effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective application method and accordingly has not restated any of its prior year results. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock-based compensation expense is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income based upon job functions of employees receiving the grants. EOG compensation expense related to its stock-based compensation plans for the years ended December 31, was as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Lease and Well $ 14 $ 10 $ - Exploration Costs 13 11 - General and Administrative 40 29 12 Total $ 67 $ 50 $ 12 25 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2007, net operating revenues increased $278 million, or 7%, to $4,191 million from $3,913 million in 2006. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, increased $474 million, or 13%, to $4,039 million from $3,565 million in 2006. Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) United States 971 817 718 Canada 224 226 228 Trinidad 252 264 231 United Kingdom 23 30 39 Total 1,470 1,337 1,216 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (1) United States $ 6.32 $ 6.56 $ 7.86 Canada 6.25 6.41 7.14 Trinidad 2.71 2.44 2.20 United Kingdom 6.19 7.69 6.99 Composite 5.69 5.74 6.62 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (2) United States 24.6 20.7 21.5 Canada 2.4 2.5 2.4 Trinidad 4.1 4.8 4.5 United Kingdom 0.1 0.1 0.2 Total 31.2 28.1 28.6 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (1) United States $ 68.85 $ 62.68 $ 54.57 Canada 65.27 57.32 50.49 Trinidad 69.84 63.87 57.36 United Kingdom 66.84 57.74 49.62 Composite 68.69 62.38 54.63 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (2) United States 11.1 8.5 6.6 Canada 1.1 0.8 0.9 Total 12.2 9.3 7.5 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (1) United States $ 47.63 $ 39.95 $ 35.59 Canada 44.54 43.69 35.59 Composite 47.36 40.25 35.59 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (3) United States 1,184 992 886 Canada 245 246 248 Trinidad 276 292 259 United Kingdom 24 31 40 Total 1,729 1,561 1,433 Total Bcfe (3) Deliveries 631.3 569.9 523.0 (1) Dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel, as applicable. (2) Thousand barrels per day. (3) Million cubic feet equivalent per day; includes natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. 26 2007 compared to 2006. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2007 increased $248 million, or 9%, to $3,051 million from $2,803 million for 2006 due to increased natural gas deliveries ($278 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($30 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to $5.69 per Mcf for 2007 from $5.74 per Mcf in 2006. Natural gas deliveries increased 133 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,470 MMcfd for 2007 from 1,337 MMcfd in 2006. The increase was due to higher production of 154 MMcfd in the United States, partially offset by lower production of 12 MMcfd in Trinidad, 7 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (119 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (13 MMcfd), Kansas (13 MMcfd) and Mississippi (10 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was due to reduced 2007 deliveries to ALNG (10 MMcfd) and a decrease in contractual demand (2 MMcfd). During 2006, EOG supplied gas for use in ALNG's start-up phase. In 2007, ALNG remained in the start-up phase, but did not require any gas from EOG until May 2007 when ALNG reached commercial status and EOG began supplying gas under the ALNG take-or-pay contract. The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $153 million, or 24%, to $778 million from $625 million as compared to 2006, due to an increase in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($81 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($72 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota. The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2007 was $68.69 per barrel compared to $62.38 per barrel for 2006. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $73 million, or 53%, to $210 million from $137 million as compared to 2006, due to increases in deliveries ($42 million) and the composite average price ($31 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and South Texas areas. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. 2006 compared to 2005. Wellhead natural gas revenues for 2006 decreased $136 million, or 5%, to $2,803 million from $2,939 million for 2005 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($407 million) and a second quarter 2005 revenue adjustment related to an amended Trinidad take-or-pay contract ($19 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($290 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 13% to $5.74 per Mcf for 2006 from $6.62 per Mcf in 2005. The Trinidad take-or-pay contract adjustment increased the average Trinidad wellhead natural gas price by $0.23 per Mcf for 2005. Natural gas deliveries increased 121 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,337 MMcfd for 2006 from 1,216 MMcfd in 2005. The increase was due to higher production of 99 MMcfd in the United States and 33 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 9 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (83 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (24 MMcfd) and Kansas (7 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in the Gulf of Mexico (16 MMcfd). The decrease in Gulf of Mexico production was partially due to continued shut-in production caused by infrastructure damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The increase in Trinidad was due to the commencement of two contracts late in the fourth quarter of 2005 (43 MMcfd) and increased contractual demand (34 MMcfd), partially offset by a decrease in volumes as a result of the December 2005 completion of a cost recovery arrangement (44 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $54 million, or 9%, to $625 million from $571 million as compared to 2005, due to an increase in the composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($78 million), partially offset by a decrease in the wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($24 million). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2006 was $62.38 per barrel compared to $54.63 per barrel for 2005. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $40 million, or 41%, to $137 million from $97 million as compared to 2005, due to increases in deliveries ($24 million) and the composite average price ($16 million). 27 During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. During 2005, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $10 million, which included realized gains of $10 million. Operating and Other Expenses 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007, operating expenses of $2,542 million were $533 million higher than the $2,009 million incurred in 2006. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 Lease and Well $0.76 $0.66 Transportation Costs 0.27 0.19 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) 1.69 1.44 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.33 0.29 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.08 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $3.12 $2.66 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep, and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $480 million in 2007 were $107 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($62 million) and Canada ($13 million), higher lease and well administrative expenses ($18 million), higher workover expenditures in the United States ($7 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third-party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a down-stream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs and transportation fees. Transportation costs of $170 million in 2007 were $60 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play and related costs associated with new marketing arrangements to transport the increased production to new downstream markets. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. 28 DD&A expenses of $1,066 million in 2007 were $248 million higher than 2006 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($122 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($5 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($102 million), Canada ($17 million) and in the United Kingdom ($2 million). The exchange rates in Canada ($10 million) and in the United Kingdom ($2 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. G&A expenses of $205 million in 2007 were $40 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($24 million), legal settlement costs ($4 million), insurance costs ($3 million) and office rent ($2 million). The increase in employee-related costs primarily reflects higher stock-based compensation expenses ($11 million). Net interest expense of $47 million in 2007 increased $4 million compared to 2006 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($13 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($9 million). Exploration costs of $150 million in 2007 were $5 million lower than 2006 due primarily to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under SFAS No. 144, ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"" which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long-lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $148 million in 2007 were $39 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments ($27 million) and increased amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($7 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Canada ($3 million). The increase in SFAS No. 144 related impairments is due to an increase in Canada ($15 million) primarily related to the Northwest Territories discovery (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements) and an increase in the United States ($12 million). Under SFAS No. 144, EOG recorded impairments of $82 million and $55 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are determined based on wellhead revenue and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2007 increased $7 million to $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $201 million (5.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2006. Severance/production taxes increased primarily due to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($27 million) and Trinidad ($2 million), partially offset by increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($26 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in Canada ($2 million). Other income, net was $29 million in 2007 compared to $52 million in 2006. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to lower interest income ($17 million), lower settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($3 million) and lower equity income from the Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited ammonia plant ($2 million). Income tax provision of $541 million in 2007 decreased $72 million compared to 2006 due primarily to decreased pretax income ($99 million), partially offset by higher foreign income taxes ($10 million) and increased state income taxes ($7 million). The net effective tax rate for 2007 increased to 33% from 32% in 2006. 29 2006 compared to 2005. During 2006, operating expenses of $2,009 million were $381 million higher than the $1,628 million incurred in 2005. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 Lease and Well $0.66 $0.54 Transportation Costs 0.19 0.17 DD&A 1.44 1.25 G&A 0.29 0.24 Net Interest Expense 0.08 0.12 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $2.66 $2.32 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments and taxes other than income. The change in per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 were due primarily to the reasons set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $373 million in 2006 were $86 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($34 million) and Canada ($16 million); higher lease and well administrative expenses ($21 million), including stock-based compensation expense ($10 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million); and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($6 million). Transportation costs of $110 million in 2006 were $23 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale play. DD&A expenses of $817 million in 2006 were $163 million higher than 2005 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($56 million) and Trinidad ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($4 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($78 million) and Canada ($11 million), and a downward reserve revision in the United Kingdom ($11 million). The Canadian exchange rate also contributed to the DD&A expense increase ($9 million). G&A expenses of $165 million in 2006 were $39 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($31 million) and higher insurance costs ($4 million). The increase in employee-related costs primarily reflects higher stock-based compensation expenses ($17 million). Net interest expense of $43 million in 2006 decreased $19 million compared to 2005 primarily due to a lower average debt balance ($9 million), costs in 2005 associated with the early retirement of the 6.00% Notes due 2008 ($8 million), and higher capitalized interest ($5 million). Exploration costs of $155 million in 2006 were $22 million higher than 2005 due primarily to higher employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses. Impairments of $108 million in 2006 were $30 million higher than 2005 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments in the United States ($17 million) and Canada ($7 million) and higher amortization of unproved leases in Canada ($4 million) and the United States ($2 million). EOG recorded impairments of $55 million and $31 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, under SFAS No. 144 for properties in the United States and Canada. Taxes other than income of $201 million in 2006 were $2 million higher than 2005. Severance taxes in the United States decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($14 million). Severance/production taxes in Trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate ($12 million), partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the Supplemental Petroleum Tax ($7 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the United States ($7 million) and Canada ($2 million). 30 Other income, net was $52 million in 2006 compared to $23 million in 2005. The increase of $29 million was primarily due to higher interest income ($19 million), settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($4 million) and increased net foreign currency transaction gains ($3 million). Income tax provision of $613 million in 2006 decreased $93 million compared to 2005 due primarily to a net decrease in foreign income taxes ($37 million), largely related to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction ($19 million) and an Alberta, Canada corporate tax rate reduction ($13 million), partially offset by a United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase ($7 million); reduced income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 ($24 million); decreased pretax income ($18 million); and reduced state income taxes ($18 million), partially offset by a decrease in the Domestic Production Activities Deduction ($7 million). The effective tax rate for 2006 decreased to 32% from 36% in 2005. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2007 were funds generated from operations, the issuance of long-term debt, proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plans, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, net commercial paper, other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facility borrowings. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; redemptions of preferred stock and debt issuance costs. 2007 compared to 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,893 million in 2007 increased $315 million compared to 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($474 million) and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($157 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($180 million), a decrease in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($87 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($55 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,456 million in 2007 increased by $745 million compared to 2006 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities was $394 million in 2007 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $299 million in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities for 2007 included the issuance of long-term debt ($600 million), proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans ($55 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($27 million) and Trinidad revolving credit facility borrowings ($10 million). Cash used by financing activities for 2007 included repayments of long-term borrowings ($158 million), cash dividend payments ($84 million), redemptions of preferred stock ($51 million) and debt issuance costs ($5 million). 2006 compared to 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,579 million in 2006 increased $209 million compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a favorable change in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($205 million), favorable changes in working capital and other liabilities ($162 million) and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes and interest expense ($54 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($173 million) and a decrease in wellhead revenues ($42 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $2,710 million in 2006 increased by $1,032 million compared to 2005 due primarily to increased additions to oil and gas properties ($1,094 million) and decreased proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties ($51 million), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital related to investing activities ($125 million). Changes in Components of Working Capital Associated with Investing Activities included changes in accounts payable associated with the accrual of exploration and development expenditures and changes in inventories which represent material and equipment used in drilling and related activities. Cash used in financing activities of $299 million in 2006 increased $227 million compared to 2005. Cash used by financing activities for 2006 included repayments of long-term debt borrowings ($317 million), cash dividend payments ($60 million) and redemption of preferred stock, including premium paid ($50 million). Cash provided by financing activities for 2006 included borrowing under a revolving credit facility ($65 million), 31 proceeds from sales of treasury stock attributable to employee stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan ($36 million) and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation expenses ($28 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, along with the total budgeted for 2008, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2008 2007 2006 2005 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 2,976 $ 2,403 $ 1,418 Leasehold Acquisitions 278 225 131 Producing Property Acquisitions 20 22 56 Capitalized Interest 29 20 15 Subtotal 3,303 2,670 1,620 Exploration Costs 150 155 133 Dry Hole Costs 115 80 65 Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,568 2,905 1,818 Approximately $4,100 Asset Retirement Costs 31 22 20 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,599 2,927 1,838 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 277 100 63 Approximately $280 Total Expenditures $ 3,876 $ 3,027 $ 1,901 Exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million for 2007 were $663 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $573 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($648 million); increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($57 million); increased dry hole costs in the United States ($19 million), Trinidad ($9 million) and the United Kingdom ($7 million); changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($18 million); and increased capitalized interest in the United States ($8 million). These increases were partially offset by lower drilling and facilities expenditures in Canada ($70 million), the United Kingdom ($12 million) and Trinidad ($7 million); decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($7 million); and decreased lease acquisitions in the United Kingdom ($6 million). The 2007 exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million includes $2,681 million in development, $838 million in exploration, $29 million in capitalized interest and $20 million in property acquisitions. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering systems and processing plants in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2006 exploration and development expenditures of $2,905 million includes $2,159 million in development, $704 million in exploration, $22 million in property acquisitions and $20 million in capitalized interest. The 2005 exploration and development expenditures of $1,818 million includes $1,260 million in development, $487 million in exploration, $56 million in property acquisitions and $15 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's 2008 and 2009 natural gas and crude oil financial price swap contracts at February 27, 2008, with notional volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and in barrels per day (Bbld), as applicable, and prices expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu) and in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl), as applicable. Currently, EOG is not a party to any financial collar contracts. EOG accounts for these price swap contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method.

The crude oil contracts for February 2008 will close on February 29, 2008. Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 14% at December 31, 2007 compared to 12% at December 31, 2006. During 2007, total debt increased $452 million to $1,185 million (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $1,227 million and $754 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2007, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in an $83 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2007 and 2006, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facility borrowings to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $1.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2007 was $590 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted 33 credit facilities during 2007 was $123 million with no amounts outstanding at year-end. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, combined with approximately $88 million of availability under its shelf registration described below, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. During September 2007, EOG issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 2017 Notes. Net proceeds of approximately $595 million were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. In December 2007, EOG repaid, at maturity, the remaining $98 million principal amount of its 6.50% Notes due in 2007. Also during 2007, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid the remaining $60 million year-end 2006 outstanding balance of its $600 million, 3-year unsecured Senior Term Loan Agreement. EOG had previously terminated its remaining borrowing capacity under the Senior Term Loan Agreement. In 2007, EOG repurchased a total of 48,260 shares of its outstanding Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including premium and fees, of $51 million, plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase. EOG has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the $3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases. At December 31, 2007, 5,000 shares of the Series B with a book value of $5 million remained outstanding. Such remaining shares were subsequently repurchased in January 2008. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 (in thousands): 2013 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2008 2009 - 2010 2011 - 2012 Beyond Long-Term Debt $ 1,185,000 $ - $ 75,000 $ 220,000 $ 890,000 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 211,654 28,472 42,305 33,881 106,996 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 656,628 71,105 135,510 118,770 331,243 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 1,928,603 149,495 385,862 377,473 1,015,773 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 380,004 200,878 178,291 835 - Seismic Purchase Obligations 3,027 3,027 - - - Other Purchase Obligations 30,767 30,767 - - - Total Contractual Obligations $ 4,395,683 $ 483,744 $ 816,968 $ 750,959 $ 2,344,012 (1) This table does not include the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties. In addition, this table does not include EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations (see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2007. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods in this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. 34 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2007, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2007 was the Canadian Dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian Dollar in 2007 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since the Canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2007, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $58 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. The market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate in 2008 will impact the level of EOG's 2008 total capital expenditures as well as its production. Including the impact of EOG's 2008 natural gas and crude oil hedges, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2008 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $20 million for net income and operating cash flow. EOG's price sensitivity in 2008 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids prices, is approximately $10 million for net income and operating cash flow. For information regarding EOG's natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of December 31, 2007, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In 2008, EOG expects to allocate an increased amount of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and the Rocky Mountain operating area which includes the Uinta Basin and the North Dakota Bakken. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG anticipates continuing to expend a portion of its available funds in the further development of Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea. In addition, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. Budgeted 2008 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $4.1 billion. In addition, budgeted 2008 expenditures for natural gas gathering and processing and other assets are approximately $280 million. The total 2008 capital expenditures budget of $4.4 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of total capital expenditures may vary in 2008 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, EOG believes net operating cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and available financing alternatives in 2008 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition 35 expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad and the United Kingdom, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Operations. Based on average North American natural gas prices of $7.50 per Mcf at Henry Hub and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, EOG expects to increase overall production in 2008 by 15% over 2007 levels. United States production is expected to increase by 19%, with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 36% and 40%, respectively. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations, and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOG's operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation, recently proposed by the Canadian legislature, to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, proposed United States policy, legislation or regulatory actions may also address GHG emissions. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we are operating to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. 36 Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a property-by-property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, ""Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies."" The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and 4) impairments. 37 Stock-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, EOG accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), ""Share Based Payment."" In applying the provisions of SFAS 123(R), judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding EOG's future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the ability to generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and financial market conditions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; changes in demand or prices for ammonia or methanol; the extent of EOG's success in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the ability to achieve production levels from existing and future oil and gas development projects due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting oil and gas reservoir performance; the availability and cost of drilling rigs, experienced drilling crews, tubular steel and other materials, equipment and services used in drilling and well completions; the availability, terms and timing of mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; access to surface locations for drilling and production facilities; the availability and capacity of gathering, processing and pipeline transportation facilities; the availability of compression uplift capacity; the extent to which EOG can economically develop its Barnett Shale acreage outside of Johnson County, Texas; whether EOG is successful in its efforts to more densely develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale and other production areas; political developments around the world and the enactment of new government policies, legislation and regulations, including environmental regulations; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and weather, including weather-related delays in the installation of gathering and production facilities. 38 In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

All of EOG's natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil, including blowouts, cratering and fires, each of which could result in damage to life and/or property. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. EOG's activities are also subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. In accordance with customary industry practices, insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. EOG's operations outside of the United States are subject to certain risks, including expropriation of assets, risks of increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments, political instability, payment delays, limits on allowable levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation losses, as well as changes in laws, regulations and policies governing operations of foreign companies. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject. Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996, is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7.

The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. 13 A substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material and adverse effect on us. Prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely. Since we are primarily a natural gas company, we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids. Among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are: the level of consumer demand; supplies of natural gas and crude oil; weather conditions; domestic and international drilling activity; the price and availability of competing energy sources, including liquefied natural gas; the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities; worldwide economic and political conditions; the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others; the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures; and the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including environmental regulations. Our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. Prolonged or substantial declines in natural gas and/or crude oil prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. In addition, if we expect significant sustained decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our natural gas and crude oil properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our natural gas and crude oil properties. Any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling natural gas and crude oil wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs. As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, and the cost of such operations may increase, as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses; the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including leases, pipelines and related facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, tubular materials and other necessary equipment; and lack of necessary services and/or qualified personnel. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 Our ability to sell and deliver our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. The sale of our natural gas and crude oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from natural gas and crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration. exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Maintaining our production of natural gas and crude oil at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, as is, in turn, our future cash flow and results of operations. A portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as natural gas or crude oil prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the United States (U.S.) are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other risks: loss of revenue, equipment and property as a result of expropriation, war and other political risks; increases in taxes and governmental royalties; renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities; difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 15 If we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves, actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us. Demand for natural gas and crude oil is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for natural gas production. In addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation. Such extreme weather conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, development, production, exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations, commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower natural gas and crude oil prices, however, would reduce our cash flow. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. The recent credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk and, related thereto, the recent weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions, may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings. In addition, a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us. We have various customers for the natural gas, crude oil and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, have recently weakened. In addition, there has been recent weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets, 16 including the credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase natural gas, crude oil or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and the equipment, materials, services and employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce and market natural gas and crude oil. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition from competing energy sources, such as liquefied natural gas imported into the U.S. from other countries and, to a lesser extent, alternative energy sources. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of proved natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Moreover, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs. Our actual proved reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business, 17 and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the natural gas and crude oil industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and by the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may materially and adversely affect EOG's business, results of operations and financial condition. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in natural gas and crude oil prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. We use derivative instruments (primarily financial collars, price swaps and basis swaps) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices on our results of operations and cash flow. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in natural gas and crude oil prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities. The exploration for, and production of, natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, injure or kill people, and damage property and the environment. Moreover, our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues 18 and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 11% of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves Reserve Information. For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids, including crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids, see ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. In general, the rate of production from EOG's natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. Volumes generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 Acreage.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom North Sea and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return, drilling internally generated prospects, delivering long-term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Net income available to common stockholders for 2008 of $2,436 million was up 125% compared to 2007 net income available to common stockholders of $1,083 million. At December 31, 2008, EOG's total reserves were 8.7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 944 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2007. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2008. United States and Canada. EOG's effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's natural gas and crude oil production. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 87% of total company production in 2008 as compared to 83% in 2007. In 2008, the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken areas produced an increasing amount of crude oil and natural gas liquids. For 2008, crude oil and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 19% of total company production as compared to 15% for 2007. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2009 crude oil and natural gas liquids production to increase as compared to 2008. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. In February 2008, EOG closed on the sale of the majority of its producing shallow gas assets and surrounding acreage in the Appalachian Basin to a subsidiary of EXCO Resources, Inc., an independent oil and gas company, for approximately $386 million ($40 million of which was received in 2007). The Appalachian area that was divested included approximately 2,400 operated wells that accounted for approximately 1% of EOG's total 2007 production and approximately 2% of its total year-end 2007 proved reserves. EOG retained certain of its undeveloped acreage in this area, including rights in the Marcellus Shale, and continued its shale exploration program in 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, EOG commenced production in its British Columbia, Canada shale gas play. EOG holds approximately 158,000 net acres in this play at December 31, 2008 and expects to slowly increase production until 2012, when the construction of additional infrastructure for the play is expected to be completed. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. In February 2008, EOG, through its subsidiary EOG Resources Trinidad Limited (EOGRT) purchased an 80% working interest in the exploration and production license covering the Pelican field and its related facilities from Trinidad and Tobago Marine Petroleum Company Limited. The acquisition includes the subsurface rights, offshore facilities, the condensate transport line and the onshore storage facilities. In October 2008, EOG, through its subsidiaries, EOGRT, EOG Resources Trinidad-U(a) Block Limited and EOG Resources Trinidad U(b) Block Unlimited (EOGRT U(b)), finalized crude oil and condensate sales contracts with the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago. The pricing terms are based on the valuation of the distillation yield of the crude oil and condensate produced less a refining margin. In April 2008, EOG's subsidiary, EOG Resources Trinidad-LRL Unlimited, relinquished its rights to Lower Reverse ""L"" Block and recorded an impairment of $20 million. In December 2008, EOG, through its subsidiaries EOGRT and EOGRT U(b), began production from the Oilbird field. 26 EOG continues to expand its exploration prospect portfolio in the United Kingdom (U.K.) in addition to its ongoing production from the Valkyrie and Arthur fields in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea Block 23/16f. There are currently two producing wells in the Arthur field, one or both of which could cease production during the second half of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2008, EOG recorded an impairment of $6 million ($3 million after-tax) for its Arthur field based on well performance. During 2008, a field development plan was submitted for the Columbus discovery in the Central North Sea. In the fourth quarter of 2008, EOGUK was awarded three Central North Sea operated licenses in the U.K. 25th Seaward Licensing Round. A rig was contracted to drill two operated wells in the East Irish Sea in 2009. The licenses for the East Irish Sea were awarded to EOG in 2007. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, The People's Republic of China. The acquisition includes production of approximately 9 million cubic feet equivalent per day, net, on approximately 130,000 acres. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to additional zones on the acreage purchased. EOG plans to drill its first horizontal well in 2009. EOG continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified. Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. At December 31, 2008, EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 17%. During 2008, EOG funded $5.4 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures, paid $115 million in dividends to common and preferred stockholders, repaid $38 million of debt and paid $5 million for the redemption of all remaining shares of its outstanding 7.195% Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Senior Preferred Stock, Series B, with a $1,000 liquidation preference per share (Series B), primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds from long-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the sale of its Appalachian assets. For 2009, EOG's budget for exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures is approximately $3.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. United States and Canada crude oil and natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures. EOG intends to manage the 2009 capital budget in order to balance expenditures with operating cash flows. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. On September 30, 2008, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $743 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. 27 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2008, net operating revenues increased $2,888 million, or 68%, to $7,127 million from $4,239 million in 2007. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids, increased $2,202 million, or 55%, to $6,222 million from $4,020 million in 2007. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market commodity derivative contracts of $598 million compared to net gains of $93 million in 2007. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $91 million, or 124%, to $165 million in 2008 from $74 million in 2007. Other, net operating revenues in 2008 primarily consist of the gain of $128 million on the sale of the Appalachian assets in February 2008. The following review of operations gives effect to the reclassifications discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,162 971 817 Canada 222 224 226 Trinidad 218 252 264 Other International (2) 17 23 30 Total 1,619 1,470 1,337 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 8.22 $ 6.27 $ 6.52 Canada 7.64 6.25 6.41 Trinidad 3.58 2.71 2.44 Other International (2) 8.18 6.19 7.69 Composite 7.51 5.65 5.72 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 39.5 24.6 20.7 Canada 2.7 2.4 2.5 Trinidad 3.2 4.1 4.8 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 45.5 31.2 28.1 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 87.68 $ 68.85 $ 62.68 Canada 89.70 65.27 57.32 Trinidad 92.90 69.84 63.87 Other International (2) 99.30 66.84 57.74 Composite 88.18 68.69 62.38 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 15.0 11.1 8.5 Canada 1.0 1.1 0.8 Total 16.0 12.2 9.3 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 53.33 $ 47.63 $ 39.95 Canada 54.77 44.54 43.69 Composite 53.42 47.36 40.25 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (4) United States 1,490 1,184 992 Canada 244 245 246 Trinidad 237 276 292 Other International (2) 17 24 31 Total 1,988 1,729 1,561 Total Bcfe (4) 727.6 631.3 569.9 (1) Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable. (2) Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom operations and, effective July 1, 2008, EOG's China operations. (3) Dollars per thousand cubic feet or per barrel, as applicable. (4) Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids. 29 2008 compared to 2007. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2008 increased $1,419 million, or 47%, to $4,452 million from $3,033 million for 2007 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($1,101 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($318 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 33% to $7.51 per Mcf in 2008 from $5.65 per Mcf in 2007. Natural gas deliveries increased 149 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,619 MMcfd in 2008 from 1,470 MMcfd in 2007. The increase was due to higher production of 191 MMcfd in the United States and initial production of 5 MMcfd in China, partially offset by lower production of 34 MMcfd in Trinidad, 11 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (140 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (54 MMcfd), Mississippi (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (4 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production due to the February 2008 sale of the Appalachian assets (15 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was primarily due to decreased deliveries as a result of plant shutdowns due to unplanned maintenance activities (29 MMcfd) and reduced deliveries due to lower demand in 2008 (10 MMcfd), partially offset by increased deliveries to Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) (5 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $680 million, or 87%, to $1,458 million in 2008 from $778 million in 2007, due to an increase of 14.3 MBbld, or 46%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($358 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($322 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (12 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2008 increased 28% to $88.18 per barrel compared to $68.69 per barrel for 2007. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $102 million, or 49%, to $312 million in 2008 from $210 million in 2007, due to increases in deliveries ($67 million) and a higher composite average price ($35 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2008 increased 13% to $53.42 per barrel compared to $47.36 per barrel for 2007. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included realized losses of $137 million. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third-party natural gas and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, substantially all of such revenues were related to sales of third-party natural gas. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party natural gas and the associated transportation costs. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs increased $5 million to $12 million in 2008 compared to $7 million in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. 2007 compared to 2006. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2007 increased $240 million, or 9%, to $3,033 million from $2,793 million in 2006 due to increased natural gas deliveries ($277 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($37 million). The composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased to $5.65 per Mcf in 2007 from $5.72 per Mcf in 2006. Natural gas deliveries increased 133 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,470 MMcfd in 2007 from 1,337 MMcfd in 2006. The increase was due to higher production of 154 MMcfd in the United States, partially offset by lower production of 12 MMcfd in Trinidad, 7 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (119 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (13 MMcfd), Kansas (13 MMcfd) and Mississippi (10 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was due to reduced 2007 deliveries to ALNG (10 MMcfd) and a decrease in contractual demand (2 MMcfd). During 2006, EOG supplied gas for use in ALNG's start-up phase. In 2007, ALNG remained in the start-up phase, but did not require any gas from EOG until May 2007 when ALNG reached commercial status and EOG began supplying gas under the ALNG take-or-pay contract. The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. 30 Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $153 million, or 24%, to $778 million in 2007 from $625 million in 2006, due to an increase in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($81 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($72 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota. The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price in 2007 was $68.69 per barrel compared to $62.38 per barrel in 2006. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $73 million, or 53%, to $210 million in 2007 from $137 million in 2006, due to increases in deliveries ($42 million) and a higher composite average price ($31 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and South Texas areas. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. During 2006, EOG recognized gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $334 million, which included realized gains of $215 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2007 increased $4 million to $7 million in 2007 from $3 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. Operating and Other Expenses 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, operating expenses of $3,360 million were $769 million higher than the $2,591 million incurred in 2007. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Lease and Well $ 0.77 $ 0.72 Transportation Costs 0.38 0.24 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties 1.74 1.63 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.09 0.06 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.34 0.33 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.07 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $ 3.39 $ 3.05 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2008 as compared to 2007 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers, and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other expenses, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $559 million in 2008 increased $107 million from $452 million in 2007 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses ($78 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($28 million), both in the United States. 31 Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third-party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs and transportation fees. Transportation costs of $274 million in 2008 increased $122 million from $152 million in 2007 primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($64 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($38 million) to downstream markets. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consist of natural gas gathering and processing facilities, compressors, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2008 increased $261 million to $1,327 million from $1,066 million in 2007. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $236 million higher than in 2007 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($210 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($10 million) and in Trinidad ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($15 million) and Canada ($8 million). Changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $25 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. G&A expenses of $244 million in 2008 were $38 million higher than 2007 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($33 million). The increase in employee-related costs primarily reflects higher stock-based compensation expenses ($18 million). Net interest expense of $52 million in 2008 increased $5 million from $47 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($18 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($13 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operation and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's natural gas gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $13 million to $41 million in 2008 as compared to $28 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. Exploration costs of $194 million in 2008 increased $44 million from $150 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million) and higher employee-related costs ($15 million). The increase in geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States was primarily attributable to activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($21 million). Impairments include amortization of unproved leases, as well as impairments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, ""Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"" (SFAS No. 144), which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long-lived assets based on future cash flow analysis. Impairments of $193 million in 2008 were $45 million higher than impairments of $148 million in 2007 due primarily to increased amortization costs as a result of increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($30 million) and Canada ($12 million), an SFAS No. 144 related impairment in Trinidad as a result of EOG's relinquishment of its rights to Lower Reverse ""L"" Block ($20 million) and an SFAS No. 144 related 32 impairment in the United Kingdom for the Arthur field ($6 million), partially offset by decreased SFAS No. 144 related impairments in Canada ($20 million). Under SFAS No. 144, EOG recorded impairments of $86 million and $82 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are determined based on wellhead revenue and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2008 increased $113 million to $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2007 primarily due to an increase in severance/production taxes in the United States as a result of increased wellhead revenues ($86 million), a decrease in credits taken in 2008 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($13 million) and increased ad valorem/property taxes as a result of higher property valuations in the United States ($20 million). Income tax provision of $1,310 million in 2008 increased $769 million compared to 2007 due primarily to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2008 increased to 35% from 33% in 2007. The increase in the 2008 net effective tax rate is primarily due to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction in 2007. 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007, operating expenses of $2,591 million were $566 million higher than the $2,025 million incurred in 2006. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 Lease and Well $ 0.72 $ 0.63 Transportation Costs 0.24 0.18 DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties 1.63 1.39 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.06 0.05 G&A 0.33 0.29 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.08 Total Per-Unit Costs (1) $ 3.05 $ 2.62 (1) Total per-unit costs do not include gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2007 as compared to 2006 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $452 million in 2007 were $96 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($53 million) and Canada ($13 million), higher lease and well administrative expenses ($17 million), higher workover expenditures in the United States ($7 million) and changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($7 million). Transportation costs of $152 million in 2007 were $52 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale Play and related costs associated with new marketing arrangements to transport the increased production to new downstream markets. DD&A expenses in 2007 increased $248 million to $1,066 million from $817 million in 2006. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $235 million higher than in 2006 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($117 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($5 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($93 million), Canada ($18 million) and in the United Kingdom ($2 million). Changes in the exchange rates in Canada ($10 million) and in the United Kingdom ($1 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. 33 DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $13 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. G&A expenses of $205 million in 2007 were $40 million higher than 2006 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($24 million), legal settlement costs ($4 million), insurance costs ($3 million) and office rent ($2 million). The increase in employee-related costs primarily reflects higher stock-based compensation expenses ($11 million). Net interest expense of $47 million in 2007 increased $4 million compared to 2006 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($13 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($9 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $10 million to $28 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase primarily reflects increased activity in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. Exploration costs of $150 million in 2007 were $5 million lower than 2006 due primarily to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments of $148 million in 2007 were $39 million higher than 2006 due primarily to increased SFAS No. 144 related impairments ($27 million) and increased amortization of unproved leases in the United States ($7 million), the United Kingdom ($3 million) and Canada ($3 million). The increase in SFAS No. 144 related impairments is due to an increase in Canada ($15 million) primarily related to the Northwest Territories discovery (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements) and an increase in the United States ($12 million). Under SFAS No. 144, EOG recorded impairments of $82 million and $55 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2007 increased $7 million to $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $201 million (5.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2006. Severance/production taxes increased primarily due to increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($27 million) and Trinidad ($2 million), partially offset by increased credits taken for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($26 million). Ad valorem/property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in Canada ($2 million). Other income, net was $29 million in 2007 compared to $52 million in 2006. The decrease of $23 million was primarily due to lower interest income ($17 million), lower settlements received related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($3 million) and lower equity income from the Nitrogen (2000) Unlimited ammonia plant ($2 million). Income tax provision of $541 million in 2007 decreased $72 million compared to 2006 due primarily to decreased pretax income ($99 million), partially offset by higher foreign income taxes ($10 million) and increased state income taxes ($7 million). The net effective tax rate for 2007 increased to 33% from 32% in 2006. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2008 were funds generated from operations, the issuance of long-term debt, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; redemptions of preferred stock and debt issuance costs. 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,633 million in 2008 increased $1,732 million from $2,901 million in 2007 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,202 million); favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($170 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($91 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($50 million); partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($404 million); an increase in marketing costs ($86 million); an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($265 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($9 million). 34 Net cash used in investing activities of $4,967 million in 2008 increased by $1,511 million from $3,456 million for the same period of 2007 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,317 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($296 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($199 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($300 million), primarily reflecting net proceeds from the sale of EOG's Appalachian assets. Net cash provided by financing activities was $645 million in 2008 compared to $386 million in 2007. Cash provided by financing activities for 2008 included the issuance of long-term debt ($750 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($73 million) and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($6 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2008 included cash dividend payments ($115 million), Trinidad revolving credit facility repayment ($38 million), treasury stock purchases ($18 million), debt issuance costs ($8 million) and the redemption of preferred stock ($5 million). 2007 compared to 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,901 million in 2007 increased $305 million compared to 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($466 million); a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($157 million); and an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($44 million); partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($172 million); an increase in marketing costs ($40 million); a decrease in the net cash flows from settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($87 million); and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($65 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,456 million in 2007 increased by $745 million compared to 2006 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($652 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($177 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($63 million). Net cash provided by financing activities was $386 million in 2007 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $316 million in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities for 2007 included the issuance of long-term debt ($600 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($55 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($27 million) and Trinidad revolving credit facility borrowings ($10 million). Cash used in financing activities for 2007 included repayments of long-term borrowings ($158 million), cash dividend payments ($84 million), redemptions of preferred stock ($51 million), treasury stock purchases ($8 million) and debt issuance costs ($5 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, along with the total expenditures budgeted for 2009, excluding acquisitions (in millions): Actual Budgeted 2009 2008 2007 2006 (excluding acquisitions) Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 3,990 $ 2,976 $ 2,403 Leasehold Acquisitions 521 278 225 Producing Property Acquisitions 109 20 22 Capitalized Interest 43 29 20 Subtotal 4,663 3,303 2,670 Exploration Costs 194 150 155 Dry Hole Costs 55 115 80 Exploration and Development Expenditures 4,912 3,568 2,905 Approximately $2,850 Asset Retirement Costs 181 31 22 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 5,093 3,599 2,927 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 477 277 100 Approximately $250 Total Expenditures $ 5,570 $ 3,876 $ 3,027 35 Exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million for 2008 were $1,344 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures of $1,014 million resulting from higher drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,064 million), increased lease acquisitions in the United States ($143 million) and Canada ($96 million), increased producing property acquisitions in the United States ($66 million) and Canada ($12 million), increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million) primarily attributable to the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale Play ($21 million), higher exploration employee-related costs ($15 million) and increased capitalized interest in the United States ($11 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased dry hole costs in the United States ($40 million) and Trinidad ($20 million). The 2008 exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million includes $3,612 million in development, $1,148 million in exploration, $109 million in producing property acquisitions and $43 million in capitalized interest. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2007 exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million includes $2,681 million in development, $838 million in exploration, $29 million in capitalized interest and $20 million in producing property acquisitions. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering systems and processing plants in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2006 exploration and development expenditures of $2,905 million includes $2,159 million in development, $704 million in exploration, $22 million in producing property acquisitions and $20 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom North Sea and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included realized losses of $137 million. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included realized gains of $128 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Financial Collar Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial collar contracts at December 31, 2008 was a positive $44 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial collar contracts at February 25, 2009. The notional volumes are expressed in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and prices are expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu). The average floor price of EOG's outstanding natural gas financial collar contracts for 2010 is $10.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and the average ceiling price is $12.32 per MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Collar Contracts Floor Price Ceiling Price Weighted Ceiling Weighted Volume Floor Range Average Price Range Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) ($/MMBtu) 2010 January 40,000 $11.44 - 11.47 $11.45 $13.79 - 13.90 $13.85 February 40,000 11.38 - 11.41 11.40 13.75 - 13.85 13.80 March 40,000 11.13 - 11.15 11.14 13.50 - 13.60 13.55 April 40,000 9.40 - 9.45 9.42 11.55 - 11.65 11.60 May 40,000 9.24 - 9.29 9.26 11.41 - 11.55 11.48 June 40,000 9.31 - 9.36 9.34 11.49 - 11.60 11.55 July 40,000 9.40 - 9.45 9.43 11.60 - 11.70 11.65 August 40,000 9.47 - 9.52 9.50 11.68 - 11.80 11.74 September 40,000 9.50 - 9.55 9.52 11.73 - 11.85 11.79 October 40,000 9.58 - 9.63 9.61 11.83 - 11.95 11.89 November 40,000 9.88 - 9.93 9.91 12.30 - 12.40 12.35 December 40,000 9.87 - 10.30 10.09 12.55 - 12.71 12.63 37 Financial Price Swap Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts at December 31, 2008 was a positive $805 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts at February 25, 2009. The notional volumes are expressed in MMBtud and prices are expressed in $/MMBtu. The average price of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts for 2009 is $9.71 per MMBtu and for 2010 is $9.87 per MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Price Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2009 January (closed) 585,000 $10.76 February (closed) 585,000 10.74 March (closed) 585,000 10.50 April 610,000 9.24 May 610,000 9.16 June 610,000 9.21 July 610,000 9.29 August 610,000 9.34 September 610,000 9.36 October 610,000 9.42 November 610,000 9.66 December 610,000 9.98 2010 January 20,000 $11.20 February 20,000 11.15 March 20,000 10.89 April 20,000 9.29 May 20,000 9.13 June 20,000 9.21 July 20,000 9.31 August 20,000 9.38 September 20,000 9.40 October 20,000 9.49 November 20,000 9.80 December 20,000 10.21 38 Financial Basis Swap Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts at December 31, 2008 was a negative $25 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts at February 25, 2009. The weighted average price differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX gas prices per MMBtu for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap. The notional volumes are expressed in MMBtud and price differentials expressed in $/MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price Differential (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2009 Second Quarter 65,000 $(2.54) Third Quarter 65,000 (2.60) Fourth Quarter 65,000 (3.03) 2010 First Quarter 65,000 $(1.72) Second Quarter 65,000 (2.56) Third Quarter 65,000 (3.17) Fourth Quarter 65,000 (3.73) 2011 First Quarter 65,000 $(1.89) Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 17% at December 31, 2008 compared to 14% at December 31, 2007. During 2008, total debt increased $712 million to $1,897 million. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,933 million and $1,227 million, respectively. The fair value of debt is the value EOG would have to pay to retire the debt, including any premium or discount to the debtholder for the differential between the stated interest rate and the year-end market rate. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2008, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in an $115 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2008 and 2007, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the offering of its 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 described below, proceeds from the sale of EOG's Appalachian assets, cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper, other uncommitted credit facilities and a revolving credit facility to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $1.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2008 was $704 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2008 was $130 million with no amounts outstanding at year-end. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On September 30, 2008, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (collectively, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $743 million were used for general 39 corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. During September 2007, EOG issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017. Net proceeds of approximately $595 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. In December 2007, EOG repaid, at maturity, the remaining $98 million principal amount of its 6.50% Notes due in 2007. Also during 2007, a foreign subsidiary of EOG repaid the remaining $60 million year-end 2006 outstanding balance of its $600 million, 3-year unsecured Senior Term Loan Agreement. EOG had previously terminated its remaining borrowing capacity under the Senior Term Loan Agreement. In 2007, EOG repurchased a total of 48,260 shares of its outstanding Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including premium and fees, of $51 million, plus accrued dividends up to the date of repurchase. EOG has included as a component of preferred stock dividends the $3 million of premium and fees associated with the repurchases. In January 2008, EOG repurchased the remaining 5,000 outstanding shares of its Series B for an aggregate purchase price, including a premium, of approximately $5.4 million. The premium of $0.4 million associated with the repurchase was included as a component of preferred stock dividends. As of December 31, 2008, no shares of Series B remain outstanding. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 (in thousands): 2014 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2009 2010 - 2011 2012 - 2013 Beyond Long-Term Debt $ 1,897,000 $ 37,000 $ 220,000 $ 400,000 $ 1,240,000 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 290,725 70,125 72,311 44,388 103,901 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 947,659 115,999 231,295 200,495 399,870 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 1,984,199 213,516 435,780 417,998 916,905 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 246,853 179,984 66,869 - - Seismic Purchase Obligations 1,000 1,000 - - - Other Purchase Obligations 81,373 60,652 20,721 - - Total Contractual Obligations $ 5,448,809 $ 678,276 $ 1,046,976 $ 1,062,881 $ 2,660,676 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian Dollars and British Pounds into United States Dollars at December 31, 2008. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. 40 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2008, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2008 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2008 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" as amended. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2008, EOG recorded the fair value of the swap of $26 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids prices. However, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids comprised a larger portion of EOG's product mix in 2008 than in prior years and is expected to increase further in 2009. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as oil and coal. The market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2009 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact the level of EOG's 2009 total capital expenditures as well as its production. Including the impact of EOG's 2009 natural gas hedges, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2009 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $17 million for net income and $25 million for operating cash flow. EOG's price sensitivity in 2009 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $14 million for net income and $21 million for operating cash flow. For information regarding EOG's natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2008, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In 2009, EOG expects to allocate a slightly lower percentage of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area and the Rocky Mountain operating area than in 2008. EOG will also execute a steady drilling program to further develop the British Columbia Horn River Basin. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. Budgeted 2009 exploration and development expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are approximately $2,850 million. In addition, budgeted 2009 expenditures for gathering and processing and other assets are approximately $250 million. The total 2009 capital expenditures budget of approximately $3.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow. The level of total capital expenditures may vary in 2009 and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, 41 EOG believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in 2009 will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration, exploitation, development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom North Sea and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2009 by 3% over 2008 levels based on average natural gas prices of $5.00 per Mcf at Henry Hub, West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices of $50.00 per barrel and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of $2,850 million, excluding acquisitions. United States production is expected to increase by 2%, with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 10% and 24%, respectively. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations, and could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control. Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on EOG's operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. EOG also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change issues. We are also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by certain of the Canadian provinces in which EOG operates. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect EOG's business, results of operations and financial condition. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and 42 economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a property-by-property basis, and any impairment in value is recognized. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive, based on historical experience, is amortized over the average holding period. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph 30 of SFAS No. 19, ""Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies."" The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and 4) impairments. 43 Stock-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, EOG accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), ""Share Based Payment."" In applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R), judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that these expectations will be achieved or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in prices for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; changes in demand for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities, including ammonia and methanol; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to discover, develop, market and produce reserves and to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties; the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling and advanced completion technologies; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in the Barnett Shale, the Bakken Formation, its Horn River Basin and Haynesville plays and its other exploration and development areas; EOG's ability to achieve anticipated production levels from existing and future natural gas and crude oil development projects, given the risks and uncertainties inherent in drilling, completing and operating natural gas and crude oil wells and the potential for interruptions of production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; EOG's ability to obtain access to surface locations for drilling and production facilities; the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated natural gas and crude oil properties are operated successfully and economically; EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired natural gas and crude oil properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; weather, including its impact on natural gas and crude oil demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities; 44 the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; changes in government policies, legislation and regulations, including environmental regulations; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and the other factors described under Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" on pages 13 through 19 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 7 of this report, specifically the information set forth under the captions ""Derivative Transactions,"" ""Financing,"" ""Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk"" and ""Outlook"" in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.""",2023-12-30 20:17:42.928511
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2010,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. All of EOG's natural gas and crude oil activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development and production of, natural gas and crude oil, including blowouts, cratering and fires, each of which could result in damage to life and/or property. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. EOG's activities are also subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. In accordance with customary industry practices, insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. In addition, EOG's operations outside of the United States are subject to certain risks, including expropriation of assets, risks of increases in taxes and government royalties, unilateral or forced renegotiation of contracts with foreign governments, political instability, payment delays, limits on allowable levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation losses, as well as changes in laws, regulations and policies governing operations of foreign companies. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject. 12 Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For a discussion of the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Operating and Other Expenses.

The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. A substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material and adverse effect on us. Prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely. Since we are primarily a natural gas company, we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids. Among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are: the level of consumer demand; supplies of natural gas and crude oil; weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; domestic and international drilling activity; the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including liquefied natural gas, and alternative energy sources; the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities; worldwide economic and political conditions; the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures; and the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including environmental regulations. Our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil. Prolonged or substantial declines in natural gas and/or crude oil prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. In addition, if we expect significant sustained decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our natural gas and crude oil properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our natural gas and crude oil properties. Any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling natural gas and crude oil wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs. As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: unexpected drilling conditions; title problems; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; compliance with, or changes in, environmental and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; 14 the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses; the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including leases, pipelines and related facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, tubular materials and other necessary equipment; and lack of necessary services and/or qualified personnel. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to sell and deliver our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. The sale of our natural gas and crude oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from natural gas and crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of natural gas and crude oil at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, as is, in turn, our future cash flow and results of operations. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. Specifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA's rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by United States (U.S.) lawmakers and by the Canadian 15 legislature to reduce GHG emissions. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any such proposed laws, regulations and treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. A portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as natural gas or crude oil prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other risks: loss of revenue, equipment and property as a result of expropriation, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; increases in taxes and governmental royalties; unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves, actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being 16 integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us. Demand for natural gas and crude oil is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for natural gas production. In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and increases in storm intensity, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, development, production, exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations, commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower natural gas and crude oil prices, however, would reduce our cash flow. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. The weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions in recent years may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. Moreover, a reduction in our cash flow (for example, as a result of lower natural gas and crude oil prices) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. In addition, a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us. We have various customers for the natural gas, crude oil and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, have weakened in recent years and remain weak. In addition, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets, including the credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase natural gas, crude oil or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to 17 another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and the equipment, materials, services and employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce and market natural gas and crude oil. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition from competing energy sources, such as liquefied natural gas imported into the U.S. from other countries and, to a lesser extent, alternative energy sources. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Moreover, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant revisions to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in natural gas and crude oil prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. We use derivative instruments (primarily financial collars, price swaps and basis swaps) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices on our results of operations and cash flow. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in natural gas and crude oil prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. 18 We do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities. The exploration for, and production of, natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, result in injury or death, and damage property and the environment. Moreover, our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 9% of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids, including crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids, as well as discussion of EOG's proved undeveloped reserves, the qualifications of the preparers of EOG's reserve estimates, EOG's independent petroleum consultants and EOG's processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates, see ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" 19 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. In general, the rate of production from EOG's natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. Volumes generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2009.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities EOG's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ""EOG."" The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales price per share for EOG's common stock, as reported by the NYSE, and the amount of the cash dividend declared per share. The quarterly cash dividend on EOG's common stock has historically been declared in the quarter immediately preceding the quarter of payment and paid on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day).

As of February 15, 2010, there were approximately 1,700 record holders and approximately 210,000 beneficial owners of EOG's common stock. EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock in the future. However, the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other factors, the financial condition, cash flow, level of exploration and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of EOG. 22 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, EOG's share repurchase activity: Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (b) Average Price Paid per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) October 1, 2009 - October 31, 2009 3,752 $89.49 - 6,386,200 November 1, 2009 - November 30, 2009 4,403 88.51 - 6,386,200 December 1, 2009 - December 31, 2009 3,960 93.89 - 6,386,200 Total 12,115 90.57 (1) The 12,115 total shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the 167,867 shares for the full year 2009 consist solely of shares that were withheld by or returned to EOG (i) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations that arose upon the exercise of employee stock options or stock-settled stock appreciation rights or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants or (ii) in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options. These shares do not count against the 10 million aggregate share repurchase authorization of EOG's Board discussed below. (2) In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of EOG's common stock. During 2009, EOG did not repurchase any shares under the Board-authorized repurchase program. 23 Comparative Stock Performance The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed ""soliciting material"" or to be ""filed"" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that EOG specifically requests that such information be treated as ""soliciting material"" or specifically incorporates such information by reference into such a filing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy. Net income available to common stockholders for 2009 totaled $547 million as compared to $2,436 million for 2008. At December 31, 2009, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 10.8 trillion cubic feet equivalent, an increase of 2,087 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) from December 31, 2008. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2009. United States and Canada. EOG's effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's natural gas and crude oil production. In Canada, EOG departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal gas growth in the Horn River Basin and horizontal oil growth within existing legacy fields, mainly in Waskada, Manitoba and Highvale, Alberta. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 86% of total company production in 2009 as compared to 87% in 2008. In 2009, the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken areas produced an increasing amount of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids. For 2009, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 22% of total company production as compared to 19% for 2008. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2010 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2009. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. During the third quarter of 2009, EOG completed three transactions to acquire certain crude oil and natural gas properties and related assets located in Montague and Cooke Counties, Texas (Barnett Shale Combo Assets). The Barnett Shale Combo Assets consist of proved developed and undeveloped reserves and approximately 33,000 net unproved acres. Production from these assets averaged approximately 2,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net, at the time of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price of the transactions totaled $196.7 million, consisting of cash consideration of $107.1 million and 1,450,000 shares of EOG common stock valued at $89.6 million on the closing date of the applicable transaction. In October 2009, EOG entered into an agreement to acquire unproved acreage located in Nacogdoches County, Texas within the Haynesville and Bossier Shale formations (Haynesville Assets). EOG acquired 39,500 net unproved acres at the principal and supplemental closings held in October 2009 and December 2009, respectively. The acquisition agreement provides for an additional one-time supplemental cash payment to the sellers of the Haynesville Assets that is contingent on the satisfaction of certain conditions (within a five-year period beginning on the principal closing date) set forth in the acquisition agreement with respect to future natural gas prices. EOG estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition dates in accordance with the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and has included such amount in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of such contingent consideration was $35.3 million at December 31, 2009. The aggregate consideration recorded in 2009 for the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets was $134 million, including the contingent consideration. Additionally, EOG expects to acquire up to an additional 7,500 net acres at a final closing expected to occur in the first quarter of 2010. The total price for the Haynesville Assets will not exceed $165 million. 26 In November 2009, EOG entered into an agreement to sell its crude oil and natural gas related assets located in California for cash consideration of $202 million, subject to customary adjustments under the agreement. The assets sold included approximately 80 wells that accounted for less than 1% of EOG's total 2009 production. The transaction closed on December 10, 2009. EOG realized a pretax gain of $146 million on the sale. In December 2009, EOG and a third party entered into an asset exchange agreement whereby the two parties exchanged certain natural gas related properties in the Rocky Mountain area. In accordance with provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the ASC, EOG realized a pretax gain of $390 million on the exchange to reflect the excess of the fair value of the properties received over the book basis of the properties given up in the transaction. In support of its operations in the North Dakota Bakken play, EOG constructed a crude oil loading facility near Stanley, North Dakota, designed to load crude oil into 100-car unit trains for transport to Stroud, Oklahoma. At Stroud, Oklahoma, EOG constructed a crude oil offloading facility and a pipeline to transport the crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub. The first shipment of crude oil through these facilities occurred at year-end 2009. When fully operational, the capacity of these facilities is expected to allow transport of approximately 60,000 barrels per day of Bakken crude oil. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. In the Pelican Field, EOG drilled a successful exploratory well in late January 2010 that is expected to begin producing by the end of the first quarter of 2010. In the United Kingdom, EOG has ongoing production from the Valkyrie and Arthur fields in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea Block 23/16f. There is currently one producing well in the Arthur field, and such well is expected to cease production during the first half of 2010. The operator and partners of the non-EOG operated Columbus discovery in the Central North Sea are continuing to evaluate export routes for future production. In addition, the operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change during the second quarter of 2010 and anticipates receiving approval in late 2010. During the third quarter of 2009, EOG completed a farm-in agreement with the owners of the Central North Sea Block 15/30a Area AB. In December 2009, EOG began drilling an exploratory well on this prospect. The well was declared a dry hole in January 2010. EOG continues to expand its exploration prospect portfolio in the United Kingdom. During the second quarter of 2009, EOG drilled two exploratory wells in the East Irish Sea. Well 110/14b-7, in which EOG has a 70% working interest, was a dry hole while well 110/12-6, in which EOG has 100% working interest, was an oil discovery. Engineering studies were initiated with an intent to submit a field development plan to the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change during the first quarter of 2010. A rig has been contracted and has begun drilling two further exploratory wells offsetting the oil discovery. The first well was declared a dry hole in February 2010 and results for the second well are expected by the end of the first quarter of 2010. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to additional shallower zones on the acreage purchased. During the second quarter of 2009, EOG completed a monitoring well and in the third quarter of 2009, drilled a horizontal well. The horizontal well is being completed and will be tested during the first quarter of 2010. In addition, to evaluate one of the shallower zones, EOG drilled a second monitoring well during the third quarter of 2009 and is currently drilling a second horizontal well that it plans to complete during the third quarter of 2010. EOG continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified. 27 Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. At December 31, 2009, EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 22%. During 2009, EOG funded $3.8 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement costs and non-cash acquisition costs), paid $142 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $11 million of treasury stock, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds from long-term debt borrowings, proceeds from the sale of its California assets and the issuance of 1.45 million shares of EOG common stock valued at $89.6 million. Management has not finalized or recommended to EOG's Board a 2010 capital expenditures budget. Management continues to evaluate various factors impacting future natural gas and crude oil prices, including the quantities of natural gas in storage and North American natural gas supplies. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. All of these factors and uncertainties impact future capital requirements. EOG expects to finalize a 2010 capital expenditures budget early in the second quarter. While EOG currently anticipates an increase in its 2010 capital expenditures budget as compared to its 2009 budget, EOG intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and a below average debt-to-capitalization ratio as compared to its peer group. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. On May 21, 2009, EOG completed its public offering of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes). Interest on the 2019 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $891 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2009, net operating revenues decreased $2,340 million, or 33%, to $4,787 million from $7,127 million in 2008. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids, decreased $2,823 million, or 45%, to $3,399 million from $6,222 million in 2008. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market commodity derivative contracts of $432 million compared to net gains of $598 million in 2008. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $242 million, or 147%, to $407 million in 2009 from $165 million in 2008. Gains on property dispositions, net in 2009 primarily consist of a pretax gain of $390 million realized on an exchange of properties in the Rocky Mountain area and a pretax gain of $146 million realized on the sale of EOG's California assets. Gains on property dispositions, net in 2008 primarily consist of the gain of $128 million on the sale of Appalachian assets in February 2008. 28 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,134 1,162 971 Canada 224 222 224 Trinidad 273 218 252 Other International (2) 14 17 23 Total 1,645 1,619 1,470 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 3.72 $ 8.22 $ 6.27 Canada 3.85 7.64 6.25 Trinidad 1.73 3.58 2.71 Other International (2) 4.34 8.18 6.19 Composite 3.42 7.51 5.65 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 47.9 39.5 24.6 Canada 4.1 2.7 2.4 Trinidad 3.1 3.2 4.1 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 55.2 45.5 31.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 54.42 $ 87.68 $ 68.85 Canada 57.72 89.70 65.27 Trinidad 50.85 92.90 69.84 Other International (2) 53.07 99.30 66.84 Composite 54.46 88.18 68.69 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 22.5 15.0 11.1 Canada 1.1 1.0 1.1 Total 23.6 16.0 12.2 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 30.03 $ 53.33 $ 47.63 Canada 30.49 54.77 44.54 Composite 30.05 53.42 47.36 Natural Gas Equivalent Volumes (MMcfed) (4) United States 1,556 1,490 1,184 Canada 256 244 245 Trinidad 291 237 276 Other International (2) 15 17 24 Total 2,118 1,988 1,729 Total Bcfe (4) 773.0 727.6 631.3 (1) Million cubic feet per day or thousand barrels per day, as applicable.

(4) Million cubic feet equivalent per day or billion cubic feet equivalent, as applicable; includes natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids. Natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas to 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids. 29 2009 compared to 2008. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2009 decreased $2,401 million, or 54%, to $2,051 million from $4,452 million for 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($2,460 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($59 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 54% to $3.42 per Mcf in 2009 from $7.51 per Mcf in 2008. Natural gas deliveries increased 26 MMcfd, or 2%, to 1,645 MMcfd in 2009 from 1,619 MMcfd in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher production of 55 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 28 MMcfd in the United States and 6 MMcfd in the United Kingdom. The increase in Trinidad was primarily due to a reduction in plant shutdowns for maintenance during 2009 (39 MMcfd) and increased net contractual deliveries (16 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production from Texas (26 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Mississippi (4 MMcfd), Kansas (3 MMcfd) and Oklahoma (3 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (6 MMcfd) and in the Rocky Mountain area (8 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues decreased $368 million, or 25%, to $1,090 million in 2009 from $1,458 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($675 million), partially offset by an increase of 10 MBbld, or 21%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($307 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (8 MBbld) and Texas (2 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2009 decreased 38% to $54.46 per barrel compared to $88.18 per barrel for 2008. Natural gas liquids revenues decreased $53 million, or 17%, to $259 million in 2009 from $312 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average price ($201 million), partially offset by an increase of 8 MBbld, or 48%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($148 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2009 decreased 44% to $30.05 per barrel compared to $53.42 per barrel for 2008. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third-party natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2009, substantially all of such revenues were related to sales of third-party natural gas and crude oil. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, such revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party natural gas. Sales of third-party natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party natural gas and crude oil and the associated transportation costs. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs decreased $2 million to $10 million in 2009 compared to $12 million in 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. 2008 compared to 2007. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2008 increased $1,419 million, or 47%, to $4,452 million from $3,033 million for 2007 due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($1,101 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($318 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 33% to $7.51 per Mcf in 2008 from $5.65 per Mcf in 2007. Natural gas deliveries increased 149 MMcfd, or 10%, to 1,619 MMcfd in 2008 from 1,470 MMcfd in 2007. The increase was due to higher production of 191 MMcfd in the United States and initial production of 5 MMcfd in China, partially offset by lower production of 34 MMcfd in Trinidad, 11 MMcfd in the United Kingdom and 2 MMcfd in Canada. The increase in the United States was primarily attributable to increased production from Texas (140 MMcfd), the Rocky Mountain area (54 MMcfd), Mississippi (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (4 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production due to the February 2008 sale of Appalachian assets (15 MMcfd). The decline in Trinidad was primarily due to decreased deliveries as a result of plant shutdowns due to unplanned maintenance activities (29 MMcfd) and reduced deliveries due to lower demand in 2008 (10 MMcfd), partially offset by increased deliveries to Atlantic LNG Train 4 (ALNG) (5 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. 30 Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues increased $680 million, or 87%, to $1,458 million in 2008 from $778 million in 2007, due to an increase of 14.3 MBbld, or 46%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($358 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($322 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (12 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2008 increased 28% to $88.18 per barrel compared to $68.69 per barrel for 2007. Natural gas liquids revenues increased $102 million, or 49%, to $312 million in 2008 from $210 million in 2007, due to increases in deliveries ($67 million) and a higher composite average price ($35 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2008 increased 13% to $53.42 per barrel compared to $47.36 per barrel for 2007. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. During 2007, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $93 million, which included net realized gains of $128 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs increased $5 million to $12 million in 2008 compared to $7 million in 2007. The increase resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. Operating and Other Expenses 2009 compared to 2008. During 2009, operating expenses of $3,816 million were $456 million higher than the $3,360 million incurred in 2008. The following table presents the costs per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 Lease and Well $ 0.75 $ 0.77 Transportation Costs 0.37 0.38 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties 1.89 1.74 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.12 0.09 General and Administrative (G&A) 0.32 0.34 Net Interest Expense 0.13 0.07 Total (1) $ 3.58 $ 3.39 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2009 compared to 2008 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's natural gas and crude oil wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 31 Lease and well expenses of $579 million in 2009 increased $20 million from $559 million in 2008 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in Canada ($16 million) and the United States ($14 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($8 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($5 million). Transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by EOG from third-party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs, transportation fees and third-party costs associated with transporting crude oil. Transportation costs of $283 million in 2009 increased $9 million from $274 million in 2008 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($19 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million). DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consist of gathering and processing assets, compressors, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2009 increased $222 million to $1,549 million from $1,327 million in 2008. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $192 million higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($42 million), Canada ($9 million) and Trinidad ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($105 million), Canada ($22 million) and Trinidad ($13 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($13 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $30 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($16 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($9 million). G&A expenses of $248 million in 2009 were $5 million higher than 2008 due primarily to higher insurance costs ($3 million) and higher employee-related costs ($2 million). Net interest expense of $101 million in 2009 increased $49 million from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($61 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($12 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $17 million to $58 million in 2009 compared to $41 million in 2008. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million). Exploration costs of $170 million in 2009 decreased $24 million from $194 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. 32 Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Impairments of $306 million in 2009 increased $113 million from $193 million in 2008 primarily due to increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($103 million) and increased impairments of proved properties in the United States ($32 million), partially offset by 2008 impairments in Trinidad as a result of EOG's relinquishment of its rights to Block Lower Reverse ""L"" (LRL) ($20 million) and in the United Kingdom for the Arthur field ($6 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties of $94 million and $86 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2009 decreased $147 million to $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) from $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2008. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues in the United States ($103 million), Trinidad ($13 million) and Canada ($3 million); an increase in credits taken in 2009 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($16 million); and lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($15 million). Other income, net was $2 million in 2009 compared to $31 million in 2008. The decrease of $29 million was primarily due to lower equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($15 million), lower interest income ($8 million) and settlements received in 2008 related to the Enron Corp. bankruptcy ($3 million). Income tax provision of $325 million in 2009 decreased $984 million compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2009 increased to 37% from 35% in 2008. The increase in the 2009 net effective tax rate is primarily as a result of higher state tax rates and the absence of 2008 tax benefits related to the impairment of LRL. 2008 compared to 2007. During 2008, operating expenses of $3,360 million were $769 million higher than the $2,591 million incurred in 2007. The following table presents the costs per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 Lease and Well $ 0.77 $ 0.72 Transportation Costs 0.38 0.24 DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties 1.74 1.63 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.09 0.06 G&A 0.34 0.33 Net Interest Expense 0.07 0.07 Total (1) $ 3.39 $ 3.05 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2008 compared to 2007 are set forth below. 33 Lease and well expenses of $559 million in 2008 increased $107 million from $452 million in 2007 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses ($78 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($28 million), both in the United States. Transportation costs of $274 million in 2008 increased $122 million from $152 million in 2007 primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($64 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($38 million) to downstream markets. DD&A expenses in 2008 increased $261 million to $1,327 million from $1,066 million in 2007. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $236 million higher than in 2007 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($210 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($10 million) and in Trinidad ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($15 million) and Canada ($8 million). Changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million) also contributed to the DD&A expense increase. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $25 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with natural gas gathering systems in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. G&A expenses of $244 million in 2008 were $38 million higher than 2007 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($33 million). The increase in employee-related costs primarily reflects higher stock-based compensation expenses ($18 million). Net interest expense of $52 million in 2008 increased $5 million from $47 million in 2007 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($18 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($13 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $13 million to $41 million in 2008 as compared to $28 million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. Exploration costs of $194 million in 2008 increased $44 million from $150 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million) and higher employee-related costs ($15 million). The increase in geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States was primarily attributable to activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($21 million). Impairments of $193 million in 2008 were $45 million higher than impairments of $148 million in 2007 due primarily to increased amortization costs as a result of increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($30 million) and Canada ($12 million), an impairment in Trinidad recorded in the second quarter of 2008 as a result of EOG's relinquishment of its rights to LRL ($20 million) and an impairment in the United Kingdom for the Arthur field ($6 million), partially offset by decreased impairments in Canada ($20 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties of $86 million and $82 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2008 increased $113 million to $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) from $208 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2007 primarily due to an increase in severance/production taxes in the United States as a result of increased wellhead revenues ($86 million), a decrease in credits taken in 2008 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($13 million) and increased ad valorem/property taxes as a result of higher property valuations in the United States ($20 million). Income tax provision of $1,310 million in 2008 increased $769 million compared to 2007 due primarily to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2008 increased to 35% from 33% in 2007. The increase in the 2008 net effective tax rate is primarily due to a Canadian federal tax rate reduction in 2007. 34 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2009 were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; repayments of debt; and redemptions of preferred stock. 2009 compared to 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,922 million in 2009 decreased $1,711 million from $4,633 million in 2008 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($2,823 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($335 million); an increase in cash operating expenses ($125 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($53 million); partially offset by a favorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,414 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($243 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($43 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,415 million in 2009 decreased by $1,552 million from $4,967 million for the same period of 2008 due primarily to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,542 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($150 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($34 million); partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($172 million). Proceeds from sales of assets included net proceeds from the sale of EOG's California assets in December 2009 ($200 million) and net proceeds from the sale of EOG's Appalachian assets in February 2008 ($386 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $834 million in 2009 included the issuance of long-term debt ($900 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($76 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($20 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2009 included cash dividend payments ($142 million), treasury stock purchases ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($9 million). 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,633 million in 2008 increased $1,732 million from $2,901 million in 2007 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,202 million); favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($170 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($91 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($50 million); partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($404 million); an increase in marketing costs ($86 million); an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($265 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($9 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,967 million in 2008 increased by $1,511 million from $3,456 million for the same period of 2007 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,317 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($296 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($199 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($300 million), primarily reflecting net proceeds from the sale of EOG's Appalachian assets. Net cash provided by financing activities of $645 million in 2008 included the issuance of long-term debt ($750 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($73 million) and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($6 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2008 included cash dividend payments ($115 million), Trinidad revolving credit facility repayment ($38 million), treasury stock purchases ($18 million), debt issuance costs ($8 million) and the redemption of preferred stock ($5 million). 35 Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions): Actual 2009 2008 2007 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 2,417 $ 3,990 $ 2,976 Leasehold Acquisitions 424 521 278 Property Acquisitions (1) 707 109 20 Capitalized Interest 55 43 29 Subtotal 3,603 4,663 3,303 Exploration Costs 170 194 150 Dry Hole Costs 51 55 115 Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,824 4,912 3,568 Asset Retirement Costs 84 181 31 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 3,908 5,093 3,599 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 326 477 277 Total Expenditures $ 4,234 $ 5,570 $ 3,876 (1) In 2009, property acquisitions includes non-cash additions of $353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the Rocky Mountain area and contingent consideration, with a fair value of $35 million, related to the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets. Exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million for 2009 were $1,088 million lower than the prior year due primarily to decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,529 million), Canada ($44 million) and Trinidad ($41 million); decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in Canada ($122 million); decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($23 million); changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in Canada ($16 million); decreased property acquisition expenditures in Trinidad ($15 million), Canada ($14 million) and China ($10 million); and decreased dry hole costs in Canada ($11 million) and the United States ($4 million). These decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisition expenditures in the United States ($638 million), increased drilling and facilities expenditures in China ($41 million) and the United Kingdom ($10 million), increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($29 million), increased capitalized interest in the United States ($15 million) and increased dry hole costs in the United Kingdom ($12 million). The 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million include $2,082 million in development, $980 million in exploration, $707 million in property acquisitions and $55 million in capitalized interest. The decrease in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. The 2008 exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million include $3,612 million in development, $1,148 million in exploration, $109 million in property acquisitions and $43 million in capitalized interest. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The 2007 exploration and development expenditures of $3,568 million include $2,681 million in development, $838 million in exploration, $29 million in capitalized interest and $20 million in property acquisitions. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 36 Derivative Transactions During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on mark-to-market financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Collar Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial collar contracts at December 31, 2009 was a positive $34 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial collar contracts at February 25, 2010. The notional volumes are expressed in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and prices are expressed in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu). The average floor price of EOG's outstanding natural gas financial collar contracts for 2010 is $9.34 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and the average ceiling price is $11.54 per MMBtu.

Financial Price Swap Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts at December 31, 2009 was a positive $16 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts at February 25, 2010. The average price of EOG's natural gas financial price swap contracts for 2010 is $9.21 per MMBtu. Natural Gas Financial Price Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2010 January (closed) 20,000 $11.20 February (closed) 20,000 11.15 March (closed) 20,000 10.89 April 20,000 9.29 May 20,000 9.13 June 20,000 9.21 On April 24, 2009, EOG settled its natural gas financial price swap contracts with notional volumes of 20,000 MMBtud for the July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 period and received proceeds of $12.1 million. 37 Financial Basis Swap Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts at December 31, 2009 was a negative $66 million, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts at February 25, 2010. The weighted average price differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX gas prices per MMBtu for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap. Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price Differential (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2010 First Quarter (1) 65,000 $(1.72) Second Quarter 65,000 (2.56) Third Quarter 65,000 (3.17) Fourth Quarter 65,000 (3.73) 2011 First Quarter 65,000 $(1.89) (1) Includes closed contracts for the month of January and February 2010. Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 22% at December 31, 2009 compared to 17% at December 31, 2008. During 2009, total debt increased $900 million to $2,797 million. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3,056 million and $1,933 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2009, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $187 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2009, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the offering of its 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 described below, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $1.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2009 was $675 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2009 was $17 million with no amounts outstanding at year-end. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On May 21, 2009, EOG completed its public offering of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes). Interest on the 2019 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $891 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 38 On September 30, 2008, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 (Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $743 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): 2015 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2010 2011 - 2012 2013 - 2014 Beyond Long-Term Debt $ 2,797,000 $ 37,000 $ 220,000 $ 550,000 $ 1,990,000 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 305,068 92,105 64,221 48,479 100,263 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 1,313,300 166,693 317,145 273,683 555,779 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 2,583,090 247,460 610,542 603,375 1,121,713 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 181,615 158,302 23,313 - - Seismic Purchase Obligations 9,667 9,667 - - - Other Purchase Obligations 79,541 74,851 4,090 600 - Total Contractual Obligations $ 7,269,281 $ 786,078 $ 1,239,311 $ 1,476,137 $ 3,767,755 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2009. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. 39 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2009, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2009 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2009 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2009, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $49 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Natural gas prices historically have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future United States and Canada natural gas and crude oil price trends, and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry. Being primarily a natural gas producer, EOG is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids prices. However, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production comprised a larger portion of EOG's production mix in 2009 than in prior years and is expected to comprise an even larger portion in 2010. Longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels, such as crude oil and coal. The market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in 2010 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact the level of EOG's 2010 total capital expenditures as well as its production. Including the impact of EOG's 2010 natural gas hedges, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2010 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $30 million for net income and $45 million for cash flows from operating activities. EOG's price sensitivity in 2010 for each $1.00 per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $22 million for net income and $33 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2009, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. Management has not finalized or recommended to EOG's Board a 2010 capital expenditures budget. Management continues to evaluate various factors impacting future natural gas and crude oil prices, including the quantities of natural gas in storage and North American natural gas supplies. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. All of these factors and uncertainties impact future capital requirements. EOG expects to finalize a 2010 capital expenditures budget early in the second quarter. While EOG currently anticipates an increase in its 2010 capital expenditures budget as compared to its 2009 budget, EOG intends to maintain a strong balance sheet and a below average debt-to-capitalization ratio as compared to its peer group. 40 Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2010 by 13% over 2009 levels. Total United States production is expected to increase by 15%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 53% and 31%, respectively. Environmental Regulations Various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration, development and production operations. These laws and regulations could cause EOG to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment. In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control, and under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. EOG also could incur costs related to the clean-up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites. In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG owns an interest but is not the operator. Moreover, EOG is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations, but, inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on EOG's operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. EOG is aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA's rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, EOG is also aware of legislation proposed by United States lawmakers and the Canadian legislature to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by certain of the Canadian provinces in which EOG operates. EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any such proposed laws, regulations and treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. EOG believes that its strategy to reduce GHG emissions throughout its operations is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice. EOG will continue to review the risks to its business and operations associated with all environmental matters, including climate change. In addition, EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. 41 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. 42 Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and 4) impairments. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Stock-Based Compensation In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing and extent of changes in prices for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities; changes in demand for natural gas, crude oil and related commodities, including ammonia and methanol; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to discover and market reserves and to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties; the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling and advanced completion technologies; 43 the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future natural gas and crude oil exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties inherent in drilling, completing and operating natural gas and crude oil wells and the potential for interruptions of production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights of way; changes in government policies, laws and regulations, including environmental and tax laws and regulations; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; EOG's ability to obtain access to surface locations for drilling and production facilities; the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated natural gas and crude oil properties are operated successfully and economically; EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired natural gas and crude oil properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; weather, including its impact on natural gas and crude oil demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and the other factors described under Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" on pages 14 through 19 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 7 of this report, specifically the information set forth under the captions ""Derivative Transactions,"" ""Financing,"" ""Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk"" and ""Outlook"" in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity."" 44",2023-12-30 20:17:41.119692
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2011,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2010, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. All of EOG's crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development and production of, crude oil and natural gas, including blowouts, rig and well explosions, cratering, fires and loss of well control, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. 12 Insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable. Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations (subject to policy terms and conditions). Moreover, in the event an incident with respect to EOG's onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions). In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG. With regard to offshore operations, all of EOG's offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors. The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations. In addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Please refer to ITEM 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject. Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For a discussion of the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7.

The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices would have a material and adverse effect on us. Prices for crude oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are: · the level of consumer demand; · supplies of crude oil and natural gas; · weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; · domestic and international drilling activity; · the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities; · worldwide economic and political conditions; · the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including liquefied natural gas, and alternative energy sources; · the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation, including environmental regulations; · the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and · the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures. Our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. 14 In addition, if we expect significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reservoirs. As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: · unexpected drilling conditions; · title problems; · pressure or irregularities in formations; · equipment failures or accidents; · adverse weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; · compliance with, or changes in, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal and hydraulic fracturing, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; · the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses; · the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including leases, pipelines, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and related facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and · costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water resources, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary equipment, supplies and services. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 15 If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, which could in turn impact our future cash flow and results of operations. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. In addition to the U.S. EPA's rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and by the Canadian federal and provincial governments to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements (such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process) and in additional operating restrictions. In addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, some states and local governments have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells, testing of nearby water wells, restrictions on the access to and usage of water and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. For additional discussion regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing, see Environmental Regulation – United States and Environmental Regulation – Canada under ITEM 1. Business – Regulation. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 16 A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations, commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, would reduce our cash flow. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. The weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions in recent years may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. Moreover, a reduction in our cash flow (for example, as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. In addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us. We have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak. In addition, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years, and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and the equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce and market crude oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as liquefied natural gas imported into the U.S. from other countries, and alternative energy sources. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Moreover, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. 18 To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant revisions to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. For related discussion, see ITEM 2. Properties – Oil and Gas Exploration and Production – Properties and Reserves. Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us. Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for natural gas production. In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. We use derivative instruments (primarily financial collars, price swaps and basis swaps) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flow. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks include, among other risks: · increases in taxes and governmental royalties; · changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; · loss of revenue, equipment and property as a result of expropriation, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; · unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; · difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and · currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19 We do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities or unexpected levels of liability. The exploration for, and production and transportation of, crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, result in injury or death, and damage property and the environment. Moreover, our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 8% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 20 ITEM 2. Properties Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves Reserve Information. For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas, as well as discussion of EOG's proved undeveloped reserves, the qualifications of the preparers of EOG's reserve estimates, EOG's independent petroleum consultants and EOG's processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates, see ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. In general, the rate of production from EOG's crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. The volumes to be generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2010. Excluded is acreage in which EOG's interest is limited to owned royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.

Company-wide, approximately 1,045,713 net acres will expire in 2011, 1,407,179 net acres will expire in 2012 and 1,092,688 net acres will expire in 2013 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions. In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. 21 Producing Well Summary. The following table reflects EOG’s ownership in producing crude oil and natural gas wells at December 31, 2010. EOG operated 15,951 gross and 14,114 net producing crude oil and natural wells. Gross crude oil and natural gas wells include 2,386 wells with multiple completions.

Legal Proceedings The information required by this Item is set forth under the ""Contingencies"" caption in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. 24 PART II ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities EOG's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ""EOG."" The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales price per share for EOG's common stock, as reported by the NYSE, and the amount of the cash dividend declared per share. The quarterly cash dividend on EOG's common stock has historically been declared in the quarter immediately preceding the quarter of payment and paid on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day). Price Range High Low Dividend Declared 2010 First Quarter $ 100.44 $ 86.78 $ 0.155 Second Quarter 114.95 93.28 0.155 Third Quarter 108.47 85.42 0.155 Fourth Quarter 102.06 86.00 0.155 2009 First Quarter $ 72.83 $ 45.03 $ 0.145 Second Quarter 79.12 53.09 0.145 Third Quarter 84.43 60.29 0.145 Fourth Quarter 101.76 79.37 0.145 On February 17, 2011, EOG's Board of Directors (Board) increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the current $0.155 per share to $0.16 per share effective beginning with the dividend to be paid on April 29, 2011 to stockholders of record as of April 15, 2011. As of February 15, 2011, there were approximately 1,800 record holders and approximately 163,000 beneficial owners of EOG's common stock. EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock in the future. However, the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other factors, the financial condition, cash flow, level of exploration and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of EOG. 25 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, EOG's share repurchase activity: Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (b) Average Price Paid per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) October 1, 2010 - October 31, 2010 6,476 $ 98.38 - 6,386,200 November 1, 2010 - November 30, 2010 2,628 92.91 - 6,386,200 December 1, 2010 - December 31, 2010 1,258 91.89 - 6,386,200 Total 10,362 96.21 (1) The 10,362 total shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 and the 115,120 shares for the full year 2010 consist solely of shares that were withheld by or returned to EOG (i) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations that arose upon the exercise of employee stock options or stock-settled stock appreciation rights or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants or (ii) in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options. These shares do not count against the 10 million aggregate share repurchase authorization of EOG's Board discussed below. (2) In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of EOG's common stock. During 2010, EOG did not repurchase any shares under the Board-authorized repurchase program. 26 Comparative Stock Performance The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed ""soliciting material"" or to be ""filed"" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that EOG specifically requests that such information be treated as ""soliciting material"" or specifically incorporates such information by reference into such a filing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy. Net income available to common stockholders for 2010 totaled $161 million as compared to $547 million for 2009. At December 31, 2010, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 1,950 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 154 MMBoe from December 31, 2009. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2010. United States and Canada. EOG's effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling expertise gained in natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil reservoirs. In 2010, EOG focused its efforts on developing its existing North American crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids acreage and capturing additional North American horizontal crude oil plays. During 2010, the North Dakota Bakken and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale areas produced an increased amount of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to 2009. EOG holds approximately 520,000 net acres in the mature oil window of the Eagle Ford Shale Play near San Antonio, Texas, where it drilled 96 net wells and completed 80 net wells in 2010. EOG averaged 15.1 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in this play in December 2010 and expects crude oil production from this play to continue to grow in 2011. In Canada, EOG departed from its historical vertical shallow natural gas drilling program to focus on bigger target horizontal natural gas growth in the Horn River Basin and horizontal crude oil growth within existing legacy fields, mainly in Waskada, Manitoba and Highvale, Alberta. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential exploration and development prospects. Production in the United States and Canada accounted for approximately 83% of total company production in 2010 as compared to 86% in 2009. For 2010, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 27% of total company production as compared to 22% for 2009. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2011 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2010. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. During the second quarter of 2010, EOG's wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, EOG Resources Canada Inc. (EOGRC), agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Galveston LNG Inc., a Calgary-based corporation which, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kitimat LNG Inc. and affiliates, owns 49 percent of the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal to be located at Bish Cove, near the Port of Kitimat, about 405 miles north of Vancouver, British Columbia. Planned capacity of the proposed Kitimat LNG terminal is about 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day or five million metric tons of LNG per year. Preliminary total construction costs, currently estimated to be approximately $3 billion (Canadian), will be revised at the conclusion of front-end engineering and design. In addition, Galveston LNG Inc. also owns a 24.5 percent interest in the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines (PTP), a total estimated $1 billion (Canadian), 300-mile project, originating at Summit Lake, British Columbia. The pipeline is intended to link Western Canada's natural gas producing regions to the Kitimat LNG terminal. An affiliate of Apache Corporation owns 51 percent of the planned Kitimat LNG terminal and a 25.5 percent interest in PTP and will be the operator of the Kitimat LNG terminal. During the fourth quarter of 2010, upon the achievement of certain commercial and regulatory milestones, EOGRC paid $210 million to complete the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. In connection with the acquisition, EOG recorded intangible assets related to 29 certain leases, permits and other contracts. Such intangible assets are included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the first quarter of 2011, EOGRC entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 24.5 percent interest in PTP for $24.5 million (subject to customary closing conditions). A portion of the purchase price ($14.7 million) will be paid at closing with the remaining amount ($9.8 million) to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the Kitimat LNG terminal. Subsequent to closing, EOGRC's ownership interest will be 49 percent. An affiliate of Apache Corporation entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 25.5 percent interest in PTP, which will increase its ownership interest to 51 percent of the proposed project. As previously reported, EOG began marketing its Canadian shallow natural gas assets in July 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, EOG closed on transactions with three separate parties to sell these assets for approximately $344 million, including an estimate of customary adjustments under each respective sales agreement. EOG recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to adjust the shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell. These assets represented approximately 4% of EOG's total 2009 production and approximately 3% of EOG's total year-end 2009 proved reserves. In addition, EOG received proceeds of approximately $329 million from the sale in 2010 of non-core producing properties and acreage, primarily in the Rocky Mountain area, Texas and Pennsylvania. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block and Modified U(b) Block, as well as the Pelican Field, have been developed and are producing. In the Pelican Field, EOG drilled a successful exploratory well that began producing in the first quarter of 2010. In Block 4(a), EOG completed installation of offshore facilities and began its development drilling program in December 2010 to supply natural gas under a contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC) into the North Eastern Offshore (NEO) pipeline being installed by NGC. EOG is sourcing the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the NEO pipeline is completed. Sales under the contract commenced on January 1, 2010. In the United Kingdom (U.K.), EOG has ongoing production from the Valkyrie field in the Southern Gas Basin of the North Sea Block 49/16f. The last well in the Arthur field ceased production in 2010. In 2006, EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (EOGUK) participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. EOG has a 25% non-operating interest in this block. A successful Columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007. The field operator expects to submit a revised field development plan to the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan by the end of 2011. The operator and partners are currently negotiating processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners. In 2009, EOGUK drilled a successful exploratory well in its East Irish Sea blocks. Well 110/12-6, in which EOGUK has a 100% working interest, was an oil discovery and was designated the Conwy field. In 2010, EOGUK added an adjoining field in its East Irish Sea block, designated Corfe, to its overall development plans. During 2010, feasibility and front-end engineering design studies were completed, and all principal contracts are currently being negotiated for the development plan. A field development plan for the Conwy field was submitted to the DECC in the first quarter of 2011 and a separate plan is expected to be submitted for the Corfe field before the end of the first quarter of 2011. Regulatory approval of both plans is expected by the end of 2011. Installation of pipelines, drilling of development wells and initial production are planned for 2012. Two additional exploratory wells offsetting the Conwy field were drilled in the first quarter of 2010. Both wells were unsuccessful. The licenses for the East Irish Sea blocks were awarded to EOGUK in 2007. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired. During 2010, EOG drilled four horizontal wells, one of which was completed in 2010 and another which was completed in January 2011. In addition, EOG completed a horizontal well that was originally drilled in 2009. The wells completed in 2010 began production in the first and second quarters of 2010. EOG plans to complete two wells during the second quarter of 2011. EOG expects to complete its evaluation of the economic viability of this project during the first half of 2011. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 30 Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 34% and 22% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2010, EOG funded $6.0 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement costs and non-cash acquisition costs), paid $153 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $11 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds from long-term debt borrowings described below and proceeds of $673 million from the sale of certain North American assets. On November 23, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) (together, the Fixed Rate Notes) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the Floating Rate Notes). Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2011. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 3, May 3, August 3 and November 3 of each year, beginning on February 3, 2011 and is based on the three-month London InterBank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.75% per annum. The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes resets quarterly on the interest payment dates. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1,487 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Contemporaneously with the offering of the Floating Rate Notes, EOG entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes at 1.87%. On September 10, 2010, EOG entered into a second $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement with domestic and foreign lenders (2010 Agreement). The 2010 Agreement matures on September 10, 2013 (subject to EOG's option to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods). See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. On May 20, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 (together, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2010. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $990 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The total anticipated 2011 capital expenditures are $6.4 to $6.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2011 expenditures will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil drilling activity and, to a lesser extent, natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays to hold acreage. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2011. EOG's business plan includes selling certain non-core natural gas assets in 2011 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and equity and debt offerings. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. 31 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2010, net operating revenues increased $1,313 million, or 27%, to $6,100 million from $4,787 million in 2009. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas, in 2010 increased $1,482 million, or 44%, to $4,881 million from $3,399 million in 2009. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million compared to net gains of $432 million in 2009. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, in 2010 increased $503 million, or 123%, to $910 million from $407 million in 2009. Gains on property dispositions, net, of $224 million in 2010 primarily consist of gains on property dispositions in the Rocky Mountain area. Gains on property dispositions, net, in 2009 primarily consist of a pretax gain of $390 million realized on an exchange of properties in the Rocky Mountain area and a pretax gain of $146 million realized on the sale of EOG's California assets. 32 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 63.2 47.9 39.5 Canada 6.7 4.1 2.7 Trinidad 4.7 3.1 3.2 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 74.7 55.2 45.5 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 74.88 $ 54.42 $ 87.68 Canada 72.66 57.72 89.70 Trinidad 68.80 50.85 92.90 Other International (2) 73.11 53.07 99.30 Composite 74.29 54.46 88.18 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 29.5 22.5 15.0 Canada 0.9 1.1 1.0 Total 30.4 23.6 16.0 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 41.68 $ 30.03 $ 53.33 Canada 43.40 30.49 54.77 Composite 41.73 30.05 53.42 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,133 1,134 1,162 Canada 200 224 222 Trinidad 341 273 218 Other International (2) 14 14 17 Total 1,688 1,645 1,619 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 4.30 $ 3.72 $ 8.22 Canada 3.91 3.85 7.64 Trinidad 2.65 1.73 3.58 Other International (2) 4.90 4.34 8.18 Composite 3.93 3.42 7.51 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 281.5 259.4 248.4 Canada 40.9 42.6 40.6 Trinidad 61.5 48.5 39.5 Other International (2) 2.5 2.4 2.8 Total 386.4 352.9 331.3 Total MMBoe (4) 141.1 128.8 121.3 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 33 2010 compared to 2009. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2010 increased $909 million, or 83%, to $1,999 million from $1,090 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($533 million) and an increase of 20 MBbld, or 35%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($376 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (8 MBbld), North Dakota (7 MBbld), Canada (3 MBbld) and Trinidad (2 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo and the Eagle Ford plays. Production increases in North Dakota resulted from increased deliveries from the Bakken and Three Forks plays. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2010 increased 36% to $74.29 per barrel compared to $54.46 per barrel in 2009. Natural gas liquids revenues in 2010 increased $203 million, or 79%, to $462 million from $259 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average price ($129 million) and an increase of 7 MBbld, or 29%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($74 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. EOG's composite average natural gas liquids price in 2010 increased 39% to $41.73 per barrel compared to $30.05 per barrel in 2009. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2010 increased $369 million, or 18%, to $2,420 million from $2,051 million in 2009. The increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($316 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($53 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 15% to $3.93 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2010 from $3.42 per Mcf in 2009. Natural gas deliveries in 2010 increased 43 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd), or 3%, to 1,688 MMcfd from 1,645 MMcfd in 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher production in Trinidad (68 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Canada (24 MMcfd) and the United States (1 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was primarily attributable to deliveries under a take-or-pay contract, which began January 1, 2010. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (28 MMcfd), offshore Gulf of Mexico (9 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Texas (5 MMcfd), Kansas (5 MMcfd) and Mississippi (4 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (45 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (11 MMcfd). During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2008, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party natural gas. The purchase and sale of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs. During 2010, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2010 totaled $25 million compared to $10 million in 2009, primarily as a result of higher crude oil marketing margins. 2009 compared to 2008. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues decreased $368 million, or 25%, to $1,090 million in 2009 from $1,458 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($675 million), partially offset by an increase of 10 MBbld, or 21%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($307 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in North Dakota (8 MBbld) and Texas (2 MBbld). The composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2009 decreased 38% to $54.46 per barrel compared to $88.18 per barrel for 2008. 34 Natural gas liquids revenues decreased $53 million, or 17%, to $259 million in 2009 from $312 million in 2008, due to a lower composite average price ($201 million), partially offset by an increase of 8 MBbld, or 48%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($148 million). The composite average natural gas liquids price for 2009 decreased 44% to $30.05 per barrel compared to $53.42 per barrel for 2008. The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2009 decreased $2,401 million, or 54%, to $2,051 million from $4,452 million for 2008 due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($2,460 million), partially offset by increased natural gas deliveries ($59 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 54% to $3.42 per Mcf in 2009 from $7.51 per Mcf in 2008. Natural gas deliveries increased 26 MMcfd, or 2%, to 1,645 MMcfd in 2009 from 1,619 MMcfd in 2008. The increase was primarily due to higher production of 55 MMcfd in Trinidad, partially offset by lower production of 28 MMcfd in the United States and 6 MMcfd in the United Kingdom. The increase in Trinidad was primarily due to a reduction in plant shutdowns for maintenance during 2009 (39 MMcfd) and increased net contractual deliveries (16 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production from Texas (26 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Mississippi (4 MMcfd), Kansas (3 MMcfd) and Oklahoma (3 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (6 MMcfd) and in the Rocky Mountain area (8 MMcfd). The decrease in production in the United Kingdom was a result of production declines in both the Arthur and Valkyrie fields. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2008, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $598 million, which included net realized losses of $137 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs decreased $2 million to $10 million in 2009 compared to $12 million in 2008. The decrease resulted primarily from natural gas marketing operations in the Gulf Coast area. Operating and Other Expenses 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, operating expenses of $5,577 million were $1,761 million higher than the $3,816 million incurred in 2009. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Lease and Well $ 4.96 $ 4.50 Transportation Costs 2.74 2.20 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties (1) 13.19 11.29 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.74 General and Administrative (G&A) 1.99 1.93 Net Interest Expense 0.92 0.78 Total (2) $ 24.59 $ 21.44 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe relating to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009 are set forth below. 35 Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. In general, operating costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating costs for wells producing natural gas. Lease and well expenses of $698 million in 2010 increased $119 million from $579 million in 2009 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($67 million) and Canada ($6 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($27 million), primarily due to higher costs associated with increased crude oil activities, unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($14 million) and increased workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Canada ($2 million). Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs, transportation fees and costs associated with EOG's crude-by-rail operations. Transportation costs of $385 million in 2010 increased $102 million from $283 million in 2009 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($46 million), the Upper Gulf Coast area ($29 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($29 million). These increases reflect costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production to downstream markets. The increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area also include costs associated with EOG's crude-by-rail operations, which began transporting crude oil from Stanley, North Dakota, to Cushing, Oklahoma, at the end of December 2009. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consist of gathering and processing assets, compressors, crude-by-rail assets, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2010 increased $393 million to $1,942 million from $1,549 million in 2009. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2010 were $378 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($97 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($2 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($8 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($167 million), Canada ($86 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($8 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($28 million), partially offset by a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability ($24 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $15 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants being placed in service in the Rocky Mountain area ($10 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($4 million). G&A expenses of $280 million in 2010 were $32 million higher than 2009 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($10 million), higher legal and other professional fees ($7 million) and higher information systems costs ($3 million). 36 Net interest expense of $130 million in 2010 increased $29 million from $101 million in 2009 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($50 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($21 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $9 million to $67 million in 2010 compared to $58 million in 2009. The increase reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($6 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). Exploration costs of $187 million in 2010 increased $17 million from $170 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased employee-related costs in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. For certain natural gas assets held for sale, EOG utilized accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Impairments of $743 million in 2010 increased $437 million from $306 million in 2009 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in Canada. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $526 million and $94 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, EOG recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to adjust certain Canadian shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, EOG recorded pretax impairments of $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain North American onshore and offshore natural gas assets. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2010 increased $143 million to $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) in 2009. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($56 million), Trinidad ($22 million) and Canada ($6 million); a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2010 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($43 million); and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($14 million). Other income, net was $14 million in 2010 compared to $2 million in 2009. The increase of $12 million was primarily due to higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($9 million). Income tax provision of $247 million in 2010 decreased $78 million compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2010 increased to 61% from 37% in 2009. The increase in the 2010 net effective tax rate is primarily due to higher state income taxes and to the tax effects of increased earnings in Trinidad and Canadian book losses, which resulted largely from the impairment of certain Canadian shallow natural gas impairments. The statutory tax rates in the United States and Trinidad are higher than the Canadian statutory rate. 37 2009 compared to 2008. During 2009, operating expenses of $3,816 million were $456 million higher than the $3,360 million incurred in 2008. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 Lease and Well $ 4.50 $ 4.62 Transportation Costs 2.20 2.26 DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties 11.29 10.41 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.74 0.54 G&A 1.93 2.01 Net Interest Expense 0.78 0.43 Total (1) $ 21.44 $ 20.27 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2009 compared to 2008 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $579 million in 2009 increased $20 million from $559 million in 2008 due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in Canada ($16 million) and the United States ($14 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($8 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($5 million). Transportation costs of $283 million in 2009 increased $9 million from $274 million in 2008 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($19 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million). DD&A expenses in 2009 increased $222 million to $1,549 million from $1,327 million in 2008. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties were $192 million higher than in 2008 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($42 million), Canada ($9 million) and Trinidad ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($3 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($105 million), Canada ($22 million) and Trinidad ($13 million), partially offset by changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($13 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $30 million higher in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to increased expenditures associated with gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($16 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($9 million). G&A expenses of $248 million in 2009 were $5 million higher than 2008 due primarily to higher insurance costs ($3 million) and higher employee-related costs ($2 million). Net interest expense of $101 million in 2009 increased $49 million from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($61 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($12 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $17 million to $58 million in 2009 compared to $41 million in 2008. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($8 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million). Exploration costs of $170 million in 2009 decreased $24 million from $194 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. 38 Impairments of $306 million in 2009 increased $113 million from $193 million in 2008 primarily due to increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($103 million) and increased impairments of proved properties in the United States ($32 million), partially offset by 2008 impairments in Trinidad as a result of EOG's relinquishment of its rights to Block Lower Reverse ""L"" (LRL) ($20 million) and in the U.K. for the Arthur field ($6 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties of $94 million and $86 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2009 decreased $147 million to $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) from $321 million (5.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2008. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues in the United States ($103 million), Trinidad ($13 million) and Canada ($3 million); an increase in credits taken in 2009 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($16 million); and lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($15 million). Other income, net was $2 million in 2009 compared to $31 million in 2008. The decrease of $29 million was primarily due to lower equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($15 million), lower interest income ($8 million) and settlements received in 2008 related to a bankruptcy ($3 million). Income tax provision of $325 million in 2009 decreased $984 million compared to 2008 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2009 increased to 37% from 35% in 2008. The increase in the 2009 net effective tax rate is primarily as a result of higher state tax rates and the absence of 2008 tax benefits related to the impairment of LRL. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; and repayments of debt. 2010 compared to 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,709 million in 2010 decreased $213 million from $2,922 million in 2009 primarily reflecting an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,271 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($410 million), an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($182 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($46 million), and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($7 million), partially offset by an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,482 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,903 million in 2010 increased by $1,488 million from $3,415 million for the same period of 2009 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,034 million); the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. ($210 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($45 million); partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($461 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($327 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $2,303 million in 2010 included proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt ($2,479 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($35 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2010 included cash dividend payments ($153 million), the repayment of long-term debt ($37 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($8 million). 39 2009 compared to 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,922 million in 2009 decreased $1,711 million from $4,633 million in 2008 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($2,823 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($335 million); an increase in cash operating expenses ($125 million); and an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($53 million); partially offset by a favorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,414 million); an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues ($243 million); and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes ($43 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $3,415 million in 2009 decreased by $1,552 million from $4,967 million for the same period of 2008 due primarily to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,542 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($150 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($34 million); partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($172 million). Proceeds from sales of assets included net proceeds from the sale of EOG's California assets in December 2009 ($200 million) and net proceeds from the sale of EOG's Appalachian assets in February 2008 ($386 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $834 million in 2009 included the issuance of long-term debt ($900 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($76 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($20 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2009 included cash dividend payments ($142 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($9 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in millions): Actual 2010 2009 2008 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 4,634 $ 2,417 $ 3,990 Leasehold Acquisitions 399 424 521 Property Acquisitions (1) 18 707 109 Capitalized Interest 76 55 43 Subtotal 5,127 3,603 4,663 Exploration Costs 187 170 194 Dry Hole Costs 72 51 55 Exploration and Development Expenditures 5,386 3,824 4,912 Asset Retirement Costs 72 84 181 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 5,458 3,908 5,093 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2) 581 326 477 Total Expenditures $ 6,039 $ 4,234 $ 5,570 (1) In 2009, property acquisitions included non-cash additions of $353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the Rocky Mountain area. In 2009 and 2010, property acquisitions also included non-cash additions for contingent consideration, with estimated fair values of $35 million and $3 million, respectively, related to the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) In 2010, other property, plant and equipment included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. (see Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements). 40 Exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million for 2010 were $1,562 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,932 million), Canada ($134 million), Trinidad ($104 million) and China ($15 million); unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in Canada ($58 million); increased capitalized interest in the United States ($21 million); increased employee-related exploration costs in the United States ($11 million); and increased dry hole costs in the United Kingdom ($11 million) and Canada ($10 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased property acquisition expenditures in the United States ($689 million), decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($20 million) and decreased dry hole costs in the United States ($9 million). The 2010 exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million included $4,366 million in development, $926 million in exploration, $76 million in capitalized interest and $18 million in property acquisitions. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment was primarily due to the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. The 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million included $2,082 million in development, $980 million in exploration, $707 million in property acquisitions and $55 million in capitalized interest. The decrease in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. The 2008 exploration and development expenditures of $4,912 million included $3,612 million in development, $1,148 million in exploration, $109 million in property acquisitions and $43 million in capitalized interest. The increase in expenditures for other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Financial Price Swap Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial price swap contracts is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 as an asset of $69 million and a liability of $21 million, respectively. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial price swap contracts at February 24, 2011, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) and in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu), as applicable. Financial Price Swap Contracts Crude Oil Natural Gas Volume (Bbld) Weighted Average Price ($/Bbl) Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) 2011 (1) January 2011 (2) 17,000 $ 90.44 275,000 $ 5.19 February 1, 2011 through March 31, 2011 (3) 18,000 90.69 425,000 5.09 April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 20,000 91.48 425,000 5.09 2012 (4) January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 2,000 $ 100.50 250,000 $ 5.56 (1) Natural gas financial price swap contracts include unexercised swaption contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into price swap contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas financial price swap contracts will increase by 275,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.90 per MMBtu for the period from April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. (2) The crude oil and natural gas contracts for January 2011 are closed. (3) The crude oil contracts for February 2011 through March 2011 will close February 28, 2011 and March 31, 2011, respectively. The natural gas contracts for February 2011 through March 2011 are closed. (4) Natural gas financial price swap contracts include unexercised swaption contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into price swap contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas financial price swap contracts will increase by 150,000 MMBtud at an average price of $5.64 per MMBtu for each month of 2012. Financial Basis Swap Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its natural gas production generally vary from New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into natural gas financial basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between prices in the Rocky Mountain area and NYMEX Henry Hub prices. The total fair value of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 as a liability of $9 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas financial basis swap contracts at February 24, 2011. The weighted average price differential represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX gas prices per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for the notional volumes covered by the basis swap. Natural Gas Financial Basis Swap Contracts Volume Weighted Average Price Differential (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2011 First Quarter (closed) 65,000 $(1.89) 42 Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2010 compared to 22% at December 31, 2009. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2010, total debt increased $2,463 million to $5,260 million. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5,602 million and $3,056 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2010, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $330 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2010, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the Fixed Rate Notes, Floating Rate Notes and Notes described below, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from net commercial paper and other uncommitted credit facilities to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2010 was $1,039 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2010 was $14 million with no amounts outstanding at year-end. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $191 million and $0.1 million, respectively, during the year 2010. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the two $1.0 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Agreements with domestic and foreign lenders described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On November 23, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) (together, the Fixed Rate Notes) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the Floating Rate Notes). Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2011. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on February 3, May 3, August 3 and November 3 of each year, beginning on February 3, 2011 and is based on the three-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum. The interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes resets quarterly on the interest payment dates. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1,487 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Contemporaneously with the offering of the Floating Rate Notes, EOG entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on the Floating Rate Notes at 1.87%. On May 20, 2010, EOG completed its public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 (together, Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2010. Net proceeds from the Notes offering of approximately $990 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. On May 21, 2009, EOG completed its public offering of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes). Interest on the 2019 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2009. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $891 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 43 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): 2016 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2011 2012 - 2013 2014 - 2015 Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $ 5,260,000 $ 220,000 $ 400,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 3,640,000 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 357,049 107,174 60,637 47,562 141,676 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 1,808,415 237,367 470,035 391,356 709,657 Pipeline Transportation Service Commitments (2) 3,315,075 305,529 688,817 777,117 1,543,612 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 355,277 213,442 135,867 5,968 - Seismic Purchase Obligations 4,050 4,050 - - - Fracturing Services Obligations 367,656 220,858 121,283 25,515 - Other Purchase Obligations 219,796 218,808 669 319 - Total Contractual Obligations $ 11,687,318 $ 1,527,228 $ 1,877,308 $ 2,247,837 $ 6,034,945 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2010. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2010, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the U.K. and China. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2010 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2010 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. 44 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2010, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $55 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income Available to Common Stockholders on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a positive change of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2011 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. Including the impact of EOG's 2011 crude oil hedges and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2011 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $26 million for net income and $38 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2011 natural gas hedges, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2011 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $19 million for net income and $28 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas hedge position as of December 31, 2010, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Three Forks and Barnett Combo plays and, to a lesser extent, natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. The total anticipated 2011 capital expenditures of $6.4 to $6.6 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non-core natural gas assets. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and equity and debt offerings. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2011 by 9.5% over 2010 levels. Total liquids production is expected to increase by 49%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 55% and 34%, respectively. North American natural gas production is expected to decrease by 5% from 2010 levels. 45 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Certain other assets, including natural gas gathering and processing facilities, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Assets are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. 46 Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. Stock-Based Compensation In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production or generate income or cash flows are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: · the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; · the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling and advanced completion technologies; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties inherent in drilling, completing and operating crude oil and natural gas wells and the potential for interruptions of development and production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; 47 · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production; · the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; · the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way; · the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal and hydraulic fracturing and laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations; · EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; · the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; · competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; · the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; · weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; · the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; · EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all; · the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; · the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; · political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; · the timing and impact of liquefied natural gas imports; · the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; · the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities; · acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and · the other factors described under Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"", on pages 14 through 20 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise. 48 ITEM 7A.

EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time. These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas. EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily collar, price swap, option and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to financial transactions, EOG is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. Under the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification, these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge accounting or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement, which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at February 24, 2012, see ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2011, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. All of EOG's crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development and production of, crude oil and natural gas, including blowouts, rig and well explosions, cratering, fires and loss of well control, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. 13 Insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable. Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations (subject to policy terms and conditions). Moreover, in the event an incident with respect to EOG's onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions). In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG. All of EOG's onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors. The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations. In addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Please refer to ITEM 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject. Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For a discussion of the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7.

The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices would have a material and adverse effect on us. Prices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are: · the level of consumer demand; · supplies of crude oil and natural gas; · weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; · domestic and international drilling activity; · the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities; · worldwide economic and political conditions; · the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources; · the nature and extent of governmental regulation (including environmental regulation and regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities) and taxation; · the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and · the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures. Our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. 15 In addition, if we expect significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices in the future such that the expected future cash flow from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including ""dry holes""). As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: · unexpected drilling conditions; · title problems; · pressure or irregularities in formations; · equipment failures or accidents; · adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns; · compliance with, or changes in, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal and hydraulic fracturing, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; · the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses; · the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and related facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and · costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water resources, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary equipment, supplies and services. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor. Our crude oil and natural gas operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities. Our onshore and offshore operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of: · well blowouts and cratering; · loss of well control; · crude oil spills, natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures; · pipe failures and casing collapses; ●uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids; · releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances; ●adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters; · fires and explosions; 16 · terrorism or vandalism; · formations with abnormal pressures; and · malfunctions of gathering, processing and other equipment. If any of these events occur, we could incur losses and liabilities as a result of: · injury or loss of life; · damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs; · pollution or other environmental damage; ● regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean-up and remediation responsibilities and costs; · suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction; and · repairs necessary to resume operations. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, which could in turn impact our future cash flow and results of operations. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively by federal, state and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 17 Specifically, as an owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years. In addition to the U.S. EPA's rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, we are also aware of legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers and by the Canadian federal and provincial governments to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. Most onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by EOG are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements (such as the reporting and public disclosure of the chemical additives used in the fracturing process) and in additional operating restrictions. In addition to the possible federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, some states and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells, testing of nearby water wells, restrictions on the access to and usage of water, disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations and restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Such federal and state permitting and disclosure requirements and operating restrictions and conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected. For additional discussion regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing, see Environmental Regulation – United States and Environmental Regulation – Canada under ITEM 1. Business – Regulation. We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For related discussion, see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 18 We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. Moreover, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations, commercial paper borrowings, sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, would reduce our cash flow. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. The weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions in recent years may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. Moreover, a reduction in our cash flow (for example, as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. In addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19 The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us. We have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak. In addition, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years, and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and the equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce and market crude oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in acquiring necessary services, equipment, supplies and personnel. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Moreover, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. 20 To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable liquids and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant revisions to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. For related discussion, see ITEM 2. Properties – Oil and Gas Exploration and Production – Properties and Reserves. Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us. Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for natural gas production. In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. We use derivative instruments (primarily financial collars, price swaps and basis swaps) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flow. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. Recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities. As discussed in the risk factor immediately above, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flow. In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, among other matters, establishes a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives, or ""swaps."" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has jurisdiction over security-based swaps, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has jurisdiction over swaps, are in the process of adopting regulations to implement this new regulatory regime. Once implemented, entities such as EOG that enter into swaps will be subject to, among other provisions, swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements; position limits for certain referenced futures contracts in the major energy markets and economically equivalent futures, options and swaps; and, subject to certain exceptions which may be applicable to EOG, swap clearing, trade execution and margin requirements (i.e., collateral posting requirements). Our swap counterparties could be subject to even greater regulatory oversight and may be subject to regulated capital requirements. 21 The applicability of such provisions (and the availability of certain exemptions) to EOG, our hedging activities and our hedging counterparties is currently uncertain, as many of the implementing regulations have not been finalized. However, the legislation and related regulations could significantly increase our cost of compliance, increase the cost and alter the terms of derivatives transactions, and adversely impact the number and creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. All of this could impact our available liquidity, require us to divert funds away from our exploration, development and production activities (e.g., in order to satisfy margin/collateral posting requirements) and reduce our ability to hedge and otherwise manage our financial and commercial risks related to crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and related regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flow may be less predictable, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks include, among other risks: · increases in taxes and governmental royalties; · changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; · loss of revenue, equipment and property as a result of expropriation, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; · unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; · difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and · currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 5% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. 22 Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. In general, the rate of production from EOG's crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. The volumes to be generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2011. Excluded is acreage in which EOG's interest is limited to owned royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.

Company-wide, approximately 1.02 million net acres will expire in 2012, 0.9 million net acres will expire in 2013 and 0.6 million net acres will expire in 2014 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions. In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. Producing Well Summary. EOG operated 15,772 gross and 13,977 net producing crude oil and natural gas wells at December 31, 2011.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy. Net income for 2011 totaled $1,091 million as compared to $161 million for 2010. At December 31, 2011, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,054 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 104 MMBoe from December 31, 2010. During 2011, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids reserves increased by 207 million barrels (MMBbl) and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 619 billion cubic feet (Bcf) or 103 MMBoe. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2011. United States and Canada. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's crude oil and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise gained from its natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. In 2011, EOG focused its efforts on developing its existing North American crude oil and condensate and liquids-rich acreage. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential liquids-rich exploration and development prospects. During 2011, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production accounted for approximately 37% of total company production as compared to 27% during 2010. North American liquids production accounted for approximately 42% of total North American production during 2011 as compared to 31% in 2010. This liquids growth reflects production from EOG's 572,000 net acre position in the oil window of the Eagle Ford Shale play near San Antonio, Texas, and increasing amounts of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. In 2011, EOG's net Eagle Ford Shale production averaged 34.1 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids as compared to 4.3 MBbld in 2010. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2012 crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2011. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. EOG delivers its crude oil to various markets in the United States, including sales points on the Gulf Coast. Most recently, with increases in crude oil production from the Eagle Ford Shale play, EOG has increased sales to the Gulf Coast and is receiving pricing for those sales based on the Light Louisiana Sweet price. In order to create further market diversification for its growing crude oil production, EOG is expanding its crude-by-rail system to have the capability to increase deliveries of crude oil to St. James, Louisiana, beginning in the second quarter of 2012. In addition, to further reduce well completion costs, EOG began using sand from its Wisconsin sand mine and sand processing facilities in late 2011. 31 In March 2011, EOG's wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, EOG Resources Canada Inc. (EOGRC), purchased an additional 24.5% interest in the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines (PTP) for $25.2 million. The PTP is intended to link western Canada's natural gas producing regions to the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal to be located at Bish Cove, near the Port of Kitimat, north of Vancouver, British Columbia (Kitimat LNG Terminal). A portion of the purchase price ($15.3 million) was paid at closing with the remaining amount to be paid contingent on the decision to proceed with the construction of the Kitimat LNG Terminal. Additionally, in March 2011, EOGRC and an affiliate of Apache Corporation (Apache), through a series of transactions, sold a portion of their interests in the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP to an affiliate of Encana Corporation (Encana). Subsequent to these transactions, ownership interests in both the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP are: Apache (operator) 40%, EOGRC 30% and Encana 30%. All future costs of the project will be paid by each party in proportion to its respective ownership percentage. In the first quarter of 2011, EOGRC and Apache awarded a front-end engineering and design contract to a global engineering company with the final report expected in the second half of 2012. In October 2011, the Canadian National Energy Board granted a 20-year export license to ship LNG from the Kitimat LNG Terminal to international markets. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block and Modified U(b) Block, as well as the Pelican Field, have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate. In Block 4(a), EOG drilled and completed six development wells in the Toucan Field and one in the EMZ Area in 2011. Production from all seven wells began in February 2012 to supply natural gas under a contract with the Natural Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. EOG sourced the natural gas for this contract from its existing fields until the Toucan Field began producing. In 2006, EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (EOGUK) participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. EOG has a 25% non-operating interest in this block. A successful Columbus prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007. The field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) during the second quarter of 2011 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the first half of 2012. The operator and partners are continuing to negotiate processing and transportation terms with export infrastructure owners. In 2009, EOGUK drilled a successful exploratory well in its East Irish Sea Blocks 110/7b and 110/12a. Well 110/12-6, in which EOGUK has a 100% working interest, was an oil discovery and was designated the Conwy field. In 2010, EOGUK added an adjoining field in its East Irish Sea block, designated Corfe, to its overall development plans. During 2011, offshore facilities fabrication began, line pipe was fabricated and all principal facilities and drilling contracts were signed. Field development plans for the Conwy and Corfe fields were submitted to the DECC during the first quarter of 2011. Regulatory approval of both plans is expected during the first quarter of 2012. Installation of facilities, pipelines and drilling of development wells are planned for 2012 with initial production expected during the first quarter of 2013. The licenses for the East Irish Sea blocks were awarded to EOGUK in 2007. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuanzhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acreage acquired. During the first quarter of 2011, EOG completed one horizontal well. During 2011, EOG signed two exploration contracts and one farm-in agreement covering approximately 100,000 net acres in the Neuquén Basin in Neuquén Province, Argentina. During the third quarter of 2011, EOG performed exploration activity on a portion of this acreage in preparation for drilling a well targeting the Vaca Muerta oil shale in the Aguada del Chivato Block. EOG began drilling this well in January 2012. In the first quarter of 2012, EOG plans to participate in the drilling of a second well in the Bajo de Toro Block targeting the Vaca Muerta oil shale. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 32 Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% and 34% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2011, EOG funded $7.1 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $220 million in long-term debt, paid $167 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $24 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, proceeds of $1,388 million from the sale of common stock and proceeds of $1,433 million from the sale of certain North American assets and the sale of a portion of EOG's interest in the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP. On October 11, 2011, EOG entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (2011 Facility) with domestic and foreign lenders. The 2011 Facility replaced EOG's two $1.0 billion senior unsecured credit facilities which were cancelled by EOG upon the closing of the 2011 Facility. Unamortized fees relating to the cancelled facilities totaling $5.7 million were written off in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 2011 Facility has a scheduled maturity date of October 11, 2016 and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods. On March 7, 2011, EOG completed the sale of 13,570,000 shares of EOG common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Common Stock), at the public offering price of $105.50 per share. Net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock were approximately $1,388 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Total anticipated 2012 capital expenditures are expected to range from $7.4 to $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2012 expenditures will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil and liquids-rich gas drilling activity and, to a much lesser extent, natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays to hold acreage. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2012. EOG's business plan includes selling certain non-core assets in 2012 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under the 2011 Facility and equity and debt offerings. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. 33 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning with page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2011, net operating revenues increased $4,026 million, or 66%, to $10,126 million from $6,100 million in 2010. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas, in 2011 increased $1,977 million, or 41%, to $6,858 million from $4,881 million in 2010. During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million compared to net gains of $62 million in 2010. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $1,206 million, or 133%, during 2011, to $2,116 million from $910 million in 2010. Gains on asset dispositions, net, totaled $493 million and $224 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily as a result of asset dispositions in the Rocky Mountain area and Texas in 2011 and in the Rocky Mountain area in 2010. 34 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 102.0 63.2 47.9 Canada 7.9 6.7 4.1 Trinidad 3.4 4.7 3.1 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 113.4 74.7 55.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 92.92 $ 74.88 $ 54.42 Canada 91.92 72.66 57.72 Trinidad 90.62 68.80 50.85 Other International (2) 100.11 73.11 53.07 Composite 92.79 74.29 54.46 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 41.5 29.5 22.5 Canada 0.9 0.9 1.1 Total 42.4 30.4 23.6 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 50.37 $ 41.68 $ 30.03 Canada 52.69 43.40 30.49 Composite 50.41 41.73 30.05 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,113 1,133 1,134 Canada 132 200 224 Trinidad 344 341 273 Other International (2) 13 14 14 Total 1,602 1,688 1,645 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 3.92 $ 4.30 $ 3.72 Canada 3.71 3.91 3.85 Trinidad 3.53 2.65 1.73 Other International (2) 5.62 4.90 4.34 Composite 3.83 3.93 3.42 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 329.1 281.5 259.4 Canada 30.7 40.9 42.6 Trinidad 60.7 61.5 48.5 Other International (2) 2.2 2.5 2.4 Total 422.7 386.4 352.9 Total MMBoe (4) 154.3 141.1 128.8 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

(4) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 35 2011 compared to 2010. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2011 increased $1,839 million, or 92%, to $3,838 million from $1,999 million in 2010, due to an increase of 39 MBbld, or 52%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($1,074 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($765 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (35 MBbld) and Colorado (3 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Eagle Ford Shale (26 MBbld) and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo (8 MBbld) plays. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2011 increased 25% to $92.79 per barrel compared to $74.29 per barrel in 2010. Natural gas liquids revenues in 2011 increased $317 million, or 69%, to $779 million from $462 million in 2010, due to an increase of 12 MBbld, or 39%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($183 million) and a higher composite average price ($134 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale (6 MBbld), the Eagle Ford Shale (4 MBbld) and the Rocky Mountain area (3 MBbld). EOG's composite average natural gas liquids price in 2011 increased 21% to $50.41 per barrel compared to $41.73 per barrel in 2010. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2011 decreased $179 million, or 7%, to $2,241 million from $2,420 million in 2010. The decrease was due to reduced natural gas deliveries ($123 million) and a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($56 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 3% to $3.83 per Mcf in 2011 from $3.93 per Mcf in 2010. Natural gas deliveries in 2011 decreased 86 MMcfd, or 5%, to 1,602 MMcfd from 1,688 MMcfd in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower production in Canada (68 MMcfd) and the United States (20 MMcfd). The decrease in Canada primarily reflects sales of certain shallow natural gas assets in 2010, partially offset by increased production from the Horn River Basin area. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (36 MMcfd), Louisiana (17 MMcfd), Mississippi (11 MMcfd), New Mexico (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (5 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Texas (38 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (23 MMcfd). During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas. The purchase and sale of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs. During 2011, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2011 increased $19 million to $44 million from $25 million in 2010, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. 2010 compared to 2009. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2010 increased $909 million, or 83%, to $1,999 million from $1,090 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($533 million) and an increase of 20 MBbld, or 35%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($376 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (8 MBbld), North Dakota (7 MBbld), Canada (3 MBbld) and Trinidad (2 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo and the Eagle Ford plays. Production increases in North Dakota resulted from increased deliveries from the Bakken and Three Forks plays. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2010 increased 36% to $74.29 per barrel compared to $54.46 per barrel in 2009. 36 Natural gas liquids revenues in 2010 increased $203 million, or 79%, to $462 million from $259 million in 2009, due to a higher composite average price ($129 million) and an increase of 7 MBbld, or 29%, in natural gas liquids deliveries ($74 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area. EOG's composite average natural gas liquids price in 2010 increased 39% to $41.73 per barrel compared to $30.05 per barrel in 2009. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2010 increased $369 million, or 18%, to $2,420 million from $2,051 million in 2009. The increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($316 million) and increased natural gas deliveries ($53 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 15% to $3.93 per Mcf in 2010 from $3.42 per Mcf in 2009. Natural gas deliveries in 2010 increased 43 MMcfd, or 3%, to 1,688 MMcfd from 1,645 MMcfd in 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher production in Trinidad (68 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Canada (24 MMcfd) and the United States (1 MMcfd). The increase in Trinidad was primarily attributable to deliveries under a take-or-pay contract, which began January 1, 2010. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (28 MMcfd), offshore Gulf of Mexico (9 MMcfd), New Mexico (6 MMcfd), Texas (5 MMcfd), Kansas (5 MMcfd) and Mississippi (4 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Louisiana (45 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (11 MMcfd). During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2009, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $432 million, which included net realized gains of $1,278 million. During 2010, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2010 totaled $25 million compared to $10 million in 2009, primarily as a result of higher crude oil marketing margins. Operating and Other Expenses 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, operating expenses of $8,013 million were $2,436 million higher than the $5,577 million incurred in 2010. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Lease and Well $ 6.11 $ 4.96 Transportation Costs 2.79 2.74 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties (1) 15.52 13.19 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.79 General and Administrative (G&A) 1.98 1.99 Net Interest Expense 1.36 0.92 Total (2) $ 28.55 $ 24.59 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe related to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage. (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2011 compared to 2010 are set forth below. 37 Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain EOG's crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. In general, operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas. Lease and well expenses of $942 million in 2011 increased $244 million from $698 million in 2010 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($188 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($33 million), increased workover expenditures in the United States ($11 million) and Canada ($4 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million), partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in Canada ($4 million). Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees, fuel costs, transportation fees and costs associated with crude-by-rail operations. Transportation costs of $430 million in 2011 increased $45 million from $385 million in 2010 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford Shale ($30 million), the Upper Gulf Coast area ($16 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($9 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in Canada ($4 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($2 million) and the South Texas area ($2 million). The net increase in transportation costs primarily reflects increased volumes transported to downstream markets. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consists of gathering and processing assets, compressors, crude-by-rail assets, sand mine and sand processing assets, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2011 increased $574 million to $2,516 million from $1,942 million in 2010. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2011 were $563 million higher than in 2010 primarily due to higher unit rates as described above ($375 million), increased production in the United States ($249 million), a reduction during 2010 in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability ($24 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($77 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($306 million), Trinidad ($37 million) and Canada ($9 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $11 million higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the Eagle Ford Shale ($5 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). G&A expenses of $305 million in 2011 were $25 million higher than 2010 due primarily to higher employee-related costs. 38 Net interest expense of $210 million in 2011 increased $80 million from $130 million in 2010 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($56 million), lower capitalized interest ($18 million) and the write-off of fees associated with revolving credit facilities cancelled in 2011 in connection with the establishment of the 2011 Facility ($6 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $14 million to $81 million in 2011 compared to $67 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($10 million), the Eagle Ford Shale ($5 million) and Canada ($5 million), partially offset by decreased activities in the Upper Gulf Coast region ($5 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($4 million). Exploration costs of $172 million in 2011 decreased $15 million from $187 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach as described in the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). For certain natural gas assets held for sale, EOG utilized accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Impairments of $1,031 million in 2011 increased $288 million from $743 million in 2010 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in the United States. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $834 million and $526 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 amount includes impairments of $745 million related to certain North American natural gas assets as a result of declining commodity prices and accepted bids. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2011 increased $94 million to $411 million (6% of wellhead revenues) from $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) in 2010. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($101 million) and a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2011 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($8 million), partially offset by lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($9 million) and Canada ($4 million) and decreased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($4 million). Other income, net was $7 million in 2011 compared to $14 million in 2010. The decrease of $7 million was primarily due to operating losses on EOG's investment in the PTP ($5 million) and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses ($5 million), partially offset by higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($3 million). 39 Income tax provision of $819 million in 2011 increased $572 million from $247 million in 2010 due primarily to greater pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2011 decreased to 43% from 61% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due mostly to foreign earnings in Trinidad (55% statutory tax rate) combined with losses in Canada (27% statutory tax rate). 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, operating expenses of $5,577 million were $1,761 million higher than the $3,816 million incurred in 2009. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 Lease and Well $ 4.96 $ 4.50 Transportation Costs 2.74 2.20 DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties (1) 13.19 11.29 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.74 G&A 1.99 1.93 Net Interest Expense 0.92 0.78 Total (2) $ 24.59 $ 21.44 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe related to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage. (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $698 million in 2010 increased $119 million from $579 million in 2009 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($67 million) and Canada ($6 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($27 million), primarily due to higher costs associated with increased crude oil activities, unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($14 million) and increased workover expenditures in the United States ($3 million) and Canada ($2 million). Transportation costs of $385 million in 2010 increased $102 million from $283 million in 2009 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($46 million), the Upper Gulf Coast area ($29 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($29 million). These increases reflect costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production to downstream markets. The increased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area also include costs associated with EOG's crude-by-rail operations, which began transporting crude oil from Stanley, North Dakota, to Cushing, Oklahoma, at the end of December 2009. DD&A expenses in 2010 increased $393 million to $1,942 million from $1,549 million in 2009. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2010 were $378 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the United States ($97 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($2 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($8 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($167 million), Canada ($86 million), Trinidad ($12 million) and China ($8 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($28 million), partially offset by a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability ($24 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $15 million higher in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to natural gas gathering systems and processing plants being placed in service in the Rocky Mountain area ($10 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($4 million). G&A expenses of $280 million in 2010 were $32 million higher than 2009 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($10 million), higher legal and other professional fees ($7 million) and higher information systems costs ($3 million). 40 Net interest expense of $130 million in 2010 increased $29 million from $101 million in 2009 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($50 million), partially offset by higher capitalized interest ($21 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $9 million to $67 million in 2010 compared to $58 million in 2009. The increase reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($6 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). Exploration costs of $187 million in 2010 increased $17 million from $170 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased employee-related costs in the United States. Impairments of $743 million in 2010 increased $437 million from $306 million in 2009 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in Canada. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $526 million and $94 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2010, EOG recorded a pretax impairment of $280 million to adjust certain Canadian shallow natural gas assets sold to estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, EOG recorded pretax impairments of $170 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to certain North American onshore and offshore natural gas assets. Taxes other than income in 2010 increased $143 million to $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $174 million (5.1% of wellhead revenues) in 2009. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($56 million), Trinidad ($22 million) and Canada ($6 million); a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2010 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($43 million); and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($14 million). Other income, net was $14 million in 2010 compared to $2 million in 2009. The increase of $12 million was primarily due to higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($9 million). Income tax provision of $247 million in 2010 decreased $78 million compared to 2009 due primarily to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2010 increased to 61% from 37% in 2009. The increase in the 2010 net effective tax rate was primarily due to higher state income taxes and to the tax effects of increased earnings in Trinidad and Canadian book losses, which resulted largely from the impairment of certain Canadian shallow natural gas assets. The statutory tax rates in the United States and Trinidad are higher than the Canadian statutory rate. 41 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2011 were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from asset sales, net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; and repayments of debt. 2011 compared to 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,578 million in 2011 increased $1,869 million from $2,709 million in 2010 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,977 million), favorable changes in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($174 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($137 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($383 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($40 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($27 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $5,755 million in 2011 increased by $852 million from $4,903 million for the same period of 2010 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,084 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($446 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($286 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($761 million) and the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. in 2010 ($210 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $1,009 million in 2011 included net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock ($1,388 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($36 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2011 included the repayment of long-term debt ($220 million), cash dividend payments ($167 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($24 million) and debt issuance costs associated with the establishment of the 2011 Facility ($5 million). 2010 compared to 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,709 million in 2010 decreased $213 million from $2,922 million in 2009 primarily reflecting an unfavorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,271 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($410 million), an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($182 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($46 million), and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($7 million), partially offset by an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,482 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $4,903 million in 2010 increased by $1,488 million from $3,415 million for the same period of 2009 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,034 million); the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. ($210 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($45 million); partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($461 million); and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($327 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $2,303 million in 2010 included proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt ($2,479 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($35 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2010 included cash dividend payments ($153 million), the repayment of long-term debt ($37 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($11 million) and debt issuance costs ($8 million). 42 Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): Actual 2011 2010 2009 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 5,878 $ 4,634 $ 2,417 Leasehold Acquisitions 301 399 424 Property Acquisitions (1) 4 18 707 Capitalized Interest 58 76 55 Subtotal 6,241 5,127 3,603 Exploration Costs 172 187 170 Dry Hole Costs 53 72 51 Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,466 5,386 3,824 Asset Retirement Costs 133 72 84 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,599 5,458 3,908 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2) 656 581 326 Total Expenditures $ 7,255 $ 6,039 $ 4,234 (1) In 2009, property acquisitions included non-cash additions of $353 million related to a property exchange transaction in the Rocky Mountain area. In 2009 and 2010, property acquisitions also included non-cash additions for contingent consideration, with estimated fair values of $35 million and $3 million, respectively, related to the acquisition of the Haynesville Assets (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) In 2010, other property, plant and equipment included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). Exploration and development expenditures of $6,466 million for 2011 were $1,080 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,421 million) and the United Kingdom ($62 million), increased dry hole costs in China ($22 million) and unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange rate in Canada ($15 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in Canada ($181 million) and China ($70 million); decreased leasehold acquisitions expenditures in the United States ($90 million) and Canada ($8 million); decreased dry hole costs in the United Kingdom ($22 million), Canada ($14 million) and Trinidad ($5 million); decreased capitalized interest in the United States ($18 million); decreased property acquisition expenditures in the United States ($14 million); and decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($13 million). The 2011 exploration and development expenditures of $6,466 million included $5,797 million in development, $607 million in exploration, $58 million in capitalized interest and $4 million in property acquisitions. In 2011, other property, plant and equipment expenditures included $231 million for sand mine and sand processing assets. The 2010 exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million included $4,366 million in development, $926 million in exploration, $76 million in capitalized interest and $18 million in property acquisitions. In 2010, other property, plant and equipment expenditures included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. The 2009 exploration and development expenditures of $3,824 million included $2,082 million in development, $980 million in exploration, $707 million in property acquisitions and $55 million in capitalized interest. In 2009, other property, plant and equipment primarily related to gathering and processing assets in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and Rocky Mountain areas. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. 43 Derivative Transactions During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commodity Derivative Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2011 as an asset of $486 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil derivative contracts at February 24, 2012, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). Crude Oil Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (Bbld) ($/Bbl) 2012 (1) January 2012 (closed) 34,000 $ 104.95 February 2012 34,000 104.95 March 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012 52,000 105.80 July 1, 2012 through August 31, 2012 35,000 105.56 September 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 17,000 103.59 (1) EOG has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for an additional six-month period. Options covering a notional volume of 17,000 Bbld are exercisable on June 29, 2012. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 17,000 Bbld at an average price of $106.31 per barrel for the period July 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. Options covering a notional volume of 18,000 Bbld are exercisable on August 31, 2012. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 18,000 Bbld at an average price of $107.42 per barrel for the period September 1, 2012 through February 28, 2013. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts as of February 24, 2012, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtu per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). Natural Gas Derivative Contracts Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) 2012 (1) January 2012 through February 29, 2012 (closed) 525,000 $ 5.44 March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 525,000 5.44 2013 (2) January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 150,000 $ 4.79 2014 (2) January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 150,000 $ 4.79 (1) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 425,000 MMBtud at an average price of $5.44 per MMBtu for the period from March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. (2) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 150,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.79 per MMBtu for each month of 2013 and 2014. 44 Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2011 compared to 34% at December 31, 2010. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2011, total debt outstanding decreased $220 million to $5,040 million. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $5,657 million and $5,602 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, upon interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2011, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a $315 million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2011, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the public offering of EOG Common Stock described below and proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2011 was $182 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $3 million during the year 2011. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by the 2011 Facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On March 7, 2011, EOG completed the sale of 13,570,000 shares of Common Stock at the public offering price of $105.50 per share. Net proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock were approximately $1,388 million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. Proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 (in thousands): 2017 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2012 2013 - 2014 2015 - 2016 Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $ 5,040,000 $ - $ 900,000 $ 900,000 $ 3,240,000 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 502,076 173,061 97,515 68,231 163,269 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 1,570,811 234,918 436,864 366,370 532,659 Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 3,256,452 359,686 779,585 844,944 1,272,237 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 339,206 230,541 105,319 3,346 - Seismic Purchase Obligations 4,087 4,087 - - - Fracturing Services Obligations 338,585 301,851 27,827 8,907 - Other Purchase Obligations 120,108 116,533 3,489 86 - Total Contractual Obligations $ 11,171,325 $ 1,420,677 $ 2,350,599 $ 2,191,884 $ 5,208,165 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2011. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). 45 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2011, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2011 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2011 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk. Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2011, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $52 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The change is included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas in 2012 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Including the impact of EOG's 2012 crude oil derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2012 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price, is approximately $31 million for net income and $46 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2012 natural gas derivative contracts, based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2012 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $11 million for net income and $16 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts as of February 24, 2012, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above. 46 Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States and Canada. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States and Canada crude oil and liquids-rich drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Three Forks, Barnett Combo, Wolfcamp and Leonard Shale plays and, to a much lesser extent, United States and Canada natural gas drilling activity in the Haynesville, Marcellus and British Columbia Horn River Basin plays to hold acreage. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. The total anticipated 2012 capital expenditures of $7.4 to $7.6 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non-core assets. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2012. EOG's business plan includes selling certain non-core assets in 2012 to partially cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under the 2011 Facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2012 by 5.5% over 2011 levels. Total liquids production is expected to increase by 30%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of 30% and 30%, respectively. North American natural gas production is expected to decrease by 11% from 2011 levels. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. 47 Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments. Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. 48 When circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows require significant judgment. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the past five years, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $30 per barrel (Bbl) to $145 per Bbl and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.83 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) to $13 per MMBtu. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary. Stock-Based Compensation In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's Common Stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's Common Stock, the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known and unknown risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: · the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; · the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling, advanced completion technologies and hydraulic fracturing; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties and capital expenditure requirements inherent in drilling, completing and operating crude oil and natural gas wells and the potential for interruptions of development and production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production; 49 · the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; · the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way; · the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; · EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; · the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; · competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; · the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; · weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; · the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; · EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; · the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; · the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; · political developments around the world, including in the areas in which EOG operates; · the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; · the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; · acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and · the other factors described under Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"", on pages 15 through 23 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise. 50 ITEM 7A.

For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2012, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risk Management. EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time. These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas. EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to financial transactions, EOG is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. Under the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification, these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge accounting or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement, which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices.

All of EOG's crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development and production of, crude oil and natural gas, including blowouts, rig and well explosions, cratering, fires and loss of well control, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. Insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable. Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations (subject to policy terms and conditions). Moreover, in the event an incident with respect to EOG's onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions). In the specific event of a well blowout or out-of-control well resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG. All of EOG's onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors. The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations. In addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Please refer to ITEM 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject with respect to its operations outside the United States. 14 Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. For a discussion of the impact on EOG, see ITEM 7.

The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" and ""EOG"" refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us. Prices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are: · the level of consumer demand; · domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; · the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; · weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; · domestic and international drilling activity; · the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities, gathering, processing and compression facilities and refining facilities; · worldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions; · the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources; · the nature and extent of governmental regulation (including environmental regulation and regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities) and taxation; · the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and · the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures. Our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. In addition, if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including ""dry holes""). As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: · unexpected drilling conditions; · title problems; · pressure or irregularities in formations; 16 · equipment failures or accidents; · adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns; · compliance with, or changes in, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing and disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; · the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses; · the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and related facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and · the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary equipment, materials, supplies and services. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor. Our crude oil and natural gas operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities. Our onshore and offshore operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of: · well blowouts and cratering; · loss of well control; · crude oil spills, natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures; · pipe failures and casing collapses; · uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids; · releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances; · adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters; · fires and explosions; · terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; · formations with abnormal pressures; and · malfunctions of gathering, processing and other equipment. If any of these events occur, we could incur losses and liabilities as a result of: · injury or loss of life; · damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs; · pollution or other environmental damage; · regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean-up and remediation responsibilities and costs; · suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction; and · repairs necessary to resume operations. 17 We maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore exploration, exploitation, development and production activities and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities are unavailable. The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In particular, in certain newer shale plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. In addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and other constraints could limit or delay the construction of new gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression or transportation facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, which could in turn impact our future cash flows and results of operations. We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively by federal, state and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 18 Local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years. EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. at the federal level. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. is primarily conducted at the state level (and, in Canada, at the provincial and local levels) through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions. Moreover, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations. Any such federal or state requirements, restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected. For additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation, see Climate Change - United States, Hydraulic Fracturing - United States and Environmental Regulation - Canada under ITEM 1. Business - Regulation. We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For related discussion, see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions. Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs. It is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 19 If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations, commercial paper borrowings, sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, would reduce our cash flows. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In addition, weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. A reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. In addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us. We have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak. In addition, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years, and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions. 20 The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and the equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce and market crude oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in acquiring necessary services, equipment, materials and personnel. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant revisions or ""write-downs"" to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. For related discussion, see ITEM 2. Properties - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves. Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us. Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for natural gas production. 21 In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. We use derivative instruments (primarily financial price swaps, options, swaptions, collar and basis swap contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. Recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities. As discussed in the risk factor immediately above, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities. Although many of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, the CFTC has issued several rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule establishing an ""end-user"" exception to mandatory clearing (End-User Exception), and a rule imposing position limits (Position Limits Rule). We qualify as a ""non-financial entity"" for purposes of the End-User Exception and, as such, we will be eligible for, and expect to utilize, such exception. As a result, our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing. However, it remains uncertain whether margin requirements will be imposed on uncleared swaps. The Position Limits Rule was vacated and remanded to the CFTC for further proceedings by order of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, and, to the extent that a position limit rule is ultimately effected, such position limit rule, could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including costs related to requirements to post collateral), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditures requirements. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 22 Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks include, among other risks: · increases in taxes and governmental royalties; · changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; · loss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; · unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; · difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and · currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 3% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 23 ITEM 1B.

For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas, as well as discussion of EOG's proved undeveloped reserves, the qualifications of the preparers of EOG's reserve estimates, EOG's independent petroleum consultants and EOG's processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates, see ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements"" represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates by different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" In general, the rate of production from EOG's crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. The volumes to be generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2012. Excluded is acreage in which EOG's interest is limited to owned royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.

Approximately 0.8 million net acres will expire in 2013, 0.7 million net acres will expire in 2014 and 0.5 million net acres will expire in 2015 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions. In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. 24 Producing Well Summary. EOG operated 15,963 gross and 14,134 net producing crude oil and natural gas wells at December 31, 2012. Gross crude oil and natural gas wells include 1,460 wells with multiple completions.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings The information required by this Item is set forth under the ""Contingencies"" caption in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. As previously reported by EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2012, in the second quarter of 2012, EOG engaged in negotiations with the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) regarding a proposed consent agreement to resolve potential air emissions violations at certain of EOG's wells in the North Dakota Bakken shale play. Upon its discovery of the potential air emissions violations, EOG promptly reported to the NDDH and implemented additional preventative controls and equipment to reduce emissions. In consideration of EOG's self-reporting and prompt implementation of such additional controls and equipment, the consent agreement will provide for reduced fines. EOG expects to finalize and enter into the consent agreement with the NDDH in the first quarter of 2013. ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures The information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95 to this report. 27 PART II ITEM 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities EOG's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ""EOG."" The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales price per share for EOG's common stock, as reported by the NYSE, and the amount of the cash dividend declared per share. The quarterly cash dividend on EOG's common stock has historically been declared in the quarter immediately preceding the quarter of payment and paid on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day). Price Range High Low Dividend Declared 2012 First Quarter $ 119.97 $ 99.82 $ 0.17 Second Quarter 114.33 82.48 0.17 Third Quarter 119.69 87.54 0.17 Fourth Quarter 124.50 107.76 0.17 2011 First Quarter $ 121.44 $ 90.84 $ 0.16 Second Quarter 119.82 96.62 0.16 Third Quarter 107.88 69.55 0.16 Fourth Quarter 106.20 66.81 0.16 On February 13, 2013, EOG's Board of Directors (Board) increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the current $0.17 per share to $0.1875 per share, effective beginning with the dividend to be paid on April 30, 2013, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2013. As of February 13, 2013, there were approximately 1,850 record holders and approximately 281,000 beneficial owners of EOG's common stock. EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock in the future. However, the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other factors, the financial condition, cash flow, level of exploration and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of EOG. 28 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, EOG's share repurchase activity: Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (b) Average Price Paid per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) October 1, 2012 - October 31, 2012 10,868 $113.96 - 6,386,200 November 1, 2012 - November 30, 2012 41,076 $119.72 - 6,386,200 December 1, 2012 - December 31, 2012 59,945 $120.17 - 6,386,200 Total 111,889 $119.40 (1) The 111,889 total shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2012, and the 574,890 shares for the full year 2012 consist solely of shares that were withheld by or returned to EOG (i) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations that arose upon the exercise of employee stock options or stock-settled stock appreciation rights or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants or (ii) in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options. These shares do not count against the 10 million aggregate share repurchase authorization of EOG's Board discussed below. (2) In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of EOG's common stock. During 2012, EOG did not repurchase any shares under the Board-authorized repurchase program. 29 Comparative Stock Performance The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed ""soliciting material"" or to be ""filed"" with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that EOG specifically requests that such information be treated as ""soliciting material"" or specifically incorporates such information by reference into such a filing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy. Net income for 2012 totaled $570 million as compared to $1,091 million for 2011. At December 31, 2012, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 1,811 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), a decrease of 243 MMBoe from December 31, 2011. During 2012, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 276 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 3,111 billion cubic feet or 519 MMBoe. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2012. United States and Canada. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the United States and Canada. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise gained from its natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. In 2012, EOG focused its efforts on developing its existing North American crude oil and liquids-rich acreage. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. During 2012, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 46% of total company production as compared to 37% during 2011. In North America, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 53% of total North American production during 2012 as compared to 42% in 2011. This liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the Eagle Ford Shale near San Antonio, Texas, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. In 2012, EOG's net Eagle Ford Shale production averaged 83.5 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and NGLs as compared to 34.1 MBbld in 2011. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2013 crude oil and condensate and NGLs production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2012. EOG's major producing areas are in Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. EOG delivers its crude oil to various markets in the United States, including sales points on the Gulf Coast where sales are based upon the Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) crude oil index. As part of its diversification strategy for its crude-by-rail shipments, in April 2012, EOG completed the construction of a crude oil unloading facility in St. James, Louisiana, where sales are based upon the LLS crude oil index. This facility, which received the first unit train of EOG crude oil in April 2012, has a capacity of approximately 120 MBbld, of which 100 MBbld belongs to EOG. To support its Permian Basin operations, EOG commissioned a crude oil loading facility in Barnhart, Texas, in 2012. EOG believes that its crude-by-rail facilities provide a distinct competitive advantage giving it the ability to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets, including both the Gulf Coast and Cushing, Oklahoma, markets. Additionally, in July 2012, EOG began shipping a portion of its Eagle Ford Shale crude oil production to Gulf Coast sales points on the newly completed Enterprise Products Partners L.P. crude oil pipeline. 32 During 2012, EOG increased production of processed sand at its state-of-the-art Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, sand plant. The plant processes sand from multiple nearby EOG-owned sand mines. The first unit train of processed sand was dispatched from Chippewa Falls in January 2012. During 2012, EOG shipped 70 sand unit trains of approximately 100 cars each to a new EOG sand storage facility in Refugio, Texas, where sand can also be coated for added strength. From Refugio, the sand is shipped primarily to the South Texas Eagle Ford Shale. EOG also ships its processed sand to other plays, including the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. EOG Resources Canada Inc. (EOGRC) owned a 30% interest in both the planned liquefied natural gas export terminal to be located near the Port of Kitimat, British Columbia (Kitimat LNG Terminal) and the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines (PTP) which is intended to link Western Canada's natural gas producing regions to the Kitimat LNG Terminal. In December 2012, EOGRC signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the Kitimat LNG Terminal and PTP, as well as approximately 28,500 undeveloped net acres in the Horn River Basin, to Chevron Canada Limited. The transaction closed in February 2013. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium Block, Modified U(a) Block and Modified U(b) Block, as well as the Pelican Field, have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate. In February 2012, production from both the Toucan Field in Block 4(a) and the adjacent EMZ Area began supplying natural gas under a contract with the Natural Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. During the fourth quarter of 2012, EOG began drilling an exploratory well in the Modified U(a) Block which was successful. This well and three additional wells to be drilled in 2013 will be completed in the first half of 2013. In 2006, EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited (EOGUK) participated in the drilling and successful testing of the Columbus prospect in the Central North Sea Block 23/16f. EOG has a 25% non-operating working interest in this block. A successful Columbus natural gas prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of 2007. The field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) during the third quarter of 2012 and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the second quarter of 2013. The project participants are currently negotiating commercial agreements. In 2007, EOGUK was awarded a license for two blocks in the East Irish Sea - Blocks 110/7b and 110/12a. In 2009, EOGUK drilled a successful exploratory well in its East Irish Sea Block 110/12a. Well 110/12-6, in which EOGUK has a 100% working interest, was an oil discovery and was designated the Conwy field. In 2010, EOGUK added an adjoining field in its East Irish Sea block, designated Corfe, to its overall development plans. Field development plans for the Conwy and Corfe fields were approved by the DECC in March 2012. The production platform and pipelines were installed in 2012, and EOG expects to begin processing facility installation during the first half of 2013. The Conwy development drilling program is expected to commence during the second quarter of 2013, with initial production expected in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2009, EOGUK was awarded a license for Block 21/12b in the Central North Sea where it expects to drill an exploratory well to test a crude oil prospect in late 2013. EOGUK has 100% interest in this block. In 2011, EOG signed two exploration contracts and one farm-in agreement covering approximately 80,000 net acres in the Neuquén Basin in Neuquén Province, Argentina. During the first half of 2012, EOG participated in the drilling and completion of a vertical well in the Bajo del Toro Block. In the first half of 2012, EOG drilled a well to monitor future well completions in the Aguada del Chivato Block and drilled and completed a horizontal well in this block. Both the horizontal and vertical wells that were completed are under evaluation. During the first quarter of 2013, EOG plans to complete the monitoring well in the Aguada del Chivato Block. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 33 Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 32% and 28% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On September 10, 2012, EOG closed its sale of $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2013. Net proceeds from the Notes offering of approximately $1,234 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures. During 2012, EOG funded $7.5 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), paid $181 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $59 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $1,234 million from the issuance of the Notes, proceeds of $1,310 million from the sale of certain North American assets and proceeds of $83 million from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity. Total anticipated 2013 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $7.0 billion to $7.2 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2013 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas drilling activity. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2013. EOG's business plan includes selling certain non-core assets in 2013, realizing proceeds of approximately $550 million, to cover the anticipated shortfall. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (2011 Facility) and equity and debt offerings. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. 34 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2012, net operating revenues increased $1,557 million, or 15%, to $11,683 million from $10,126 million in 2011. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, in 2012 increased $1,100 million, or 16%, to $7,958 million from $6,858 million in 2011. During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million compared to net gains of $626 million in 2011. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $981 million, or 46%, during 2012, to $3,097 million from $2,116 million in 2011. Gains on asset dispositions, net, totaled $193 million and $493 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. 35 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 149.3 102.0 63.2 Canada 7.0 7.9 6.7 Trinidad 1.5 3.4 4.7 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 157.9 113.4 74.7 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 98.38 $ 92.92 $ 74.88 Canada 86.08 91.92 72.66 Trinidad 92.26 90.62 68.80 Other International (2) 89.57 100.11 73.11 Composite 97.77 92.79 74.29 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 55.1 41.5 29.5 Canada 0.8 0.9 0.9 Total 55.9 42.4 30.4 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 35.41 $ 50.37 $ 41.68 Canada 44.13 52.69 43.40 Composite 35.54 50.41 41.73 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,034 1,113 1,133 Canada 95 132 200 Trinidad 378 344 341 Other International (2) 9 13 14 Total 1,516 1,602 1,688 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 2.51 $ 3.92 $ 4.30 Canada 2.49 3.71 3.91 Trinidad 3.72 3.53 2.65 Other International (2) 5.71 5.62 4.90 Composite 2.83 3.83 3.93 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 376.6 329.1 281.5 Canada 23.6 30.7 40.9 Trinidad 64.5 60.7 61.5 Other International (2) 1.7 2.2 2.5 Total 466.4 422.7 386.4 Total MMBoe (4) 170.7 154.3 141.1 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 36 2012 compared to 2011. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2012 increased $1,821 million, or 47%, to $5,659 million from $3,838 million in 2011, due to an increase of 45 MBbld, or 39%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($1,533 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($288 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the Eagle Ford Shale and Bakken. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2012 increased 5% to $97.77 per barrel compared to $92.79 per barrel in 2011. NGLs revenues in 2012 decreased $52 million, or 7%, to $727 million from $779 million in 2011, due to a lower composite average price ($304 million), partially offset by an increase of 14 MBbld, or 32%, in NGLs deliveries ($252 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Eagle Ford Shale (7 MBbld), the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale (3 MBbld) and the Permian Basin (2 MBbld). EOG's composite average NGLs price in 2012 decreased 30% to $35.54 per barrel compared to $50.41 per barrel in 2011. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2012 decreased $669 million, or 30%, to $1,572 million from $2,241 million in 2011. The decrease was due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($554 million) and decreased natural gas deliveries ($115 million). Natural gas deliveries in 2012 decreased 86 MMcfd, or 5%, to 1,516 MMcfd from 1,602 MMcfd in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower production in the United States (79 MMcfd) and Canada (37 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Trinidad (34 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity. The decrease in Canada primarily reflects decreased production in Alberta and the Horn River Basin area. The increase in Trinidad was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual deliveries. EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 26% to $2.83 per Mcf in 2012 from $3.83 per Mcf in 2011. During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net realized gains of $711 million. During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs. During 2012, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased, compared to 2011, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2012 totaled $61 million compared to $44 million in 2011. 2011 compared to 2010. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2011 increased $1,839 million, or 92%, to $3,838 million from $1,999 million in 2010, due to an increase of 39 MBbld, or 52%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($1,074 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($765 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in Texas (35 MBbld) and Colorado (3 MBbld). Production increases in Texas were the result of increased production from the Eagle Ford Shale (26 MBbld) and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Combo (8 MBbld) plays. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2011 increased 25% to $92.79 per barrel compared to $74.29 per barrel in 2010. 37 NGLs revenues in 2011 increased $317 million, or 69%, to $779 million from $462 million in 2010, due to an increase of 12 MBbld, or 39%, in NGLs deliveries ($183 million) and a higher composite average price ($134 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale (6 MBbld), the Eagle Ford Shale (4 MBbld) and the Rocky Mountain area (3 MBbld). EOG's composite average NGLs price in 2011 increased 21% to $50.41 per barrel compared to $41.73 per barrel in 2010. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2011 decreased $179 million, or 7%, to $2,241 million from $2,420 million in 2010. The decrease was due to reduced natural gas deliveries ($123 million) and a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($56 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 3% to $3.83 per Mcf in 2011 from $3.93 per Mcf in 2010. Natural gas deliveries in 2011 decreased 86 MMcfd, or 5%, to 1,602 MMcfd from 1,688 MMcfd in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower production in Canada (68 MMcfd) and the United States (20 MMcfd). The decrease in Canada primarily reflects sales of certain shallow natural gas assets in 2010, partially offset by increased production from the Horn River Basin area. The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to decreased production in the Rocky Mountain area (36 MMcfd), Louisiana (17 MMcfd), Mississippi (11 MMcfd), New Mexico (8 MMcfd) and Kansas (5 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Texas (38 MMcfd) and Pennsylvania (23 MMcfd). During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. During 2010, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net realized gains of $7 million. During 2011, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2011 increased $19 million to $44 million from $25 million in 2010, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Operating and Other Expenses 2012 compared to 2011. During 2012, operating expenses of $10,203 million were $2,190 million higher than the $8,013 million incurred in 2011. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: 2012 2011 Lease and Well $ 5.85 $ 6.11 Transportation Costs 3.52 2.79 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties 17.71 15.52 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.85 0.79 General and Administrative (G&A) 1.94 1.98 Net Interest Expense 1.25 1.36 Total (1) $ 31.12 $ 28.55 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A and G&A for 2012 compared to 2011 are set forth below. 38 Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. In general, operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas. Lease and well expenses of $1,000 million in 2012 increased $58 million from $942 million in 2011 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($60 million) and Trinidad ($5 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in Canada ($12 million) and decreased workover expenditures in Canada ($6 million) and the United States ($5 million). Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs. Transportation costs of $601 million in 2012 increased $171 million from $430 million in 2011 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Eagle Ford Shale ($101 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($73 million). DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consists of gathering, transportation and processing infrastructure assets, compressors, crude-by-rail assets, sand mine and sand processing assets, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2012 increased $654 million to $3,170 million from $2,516 million in 2011. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2012 were $631 million higher than in 2011 primarily due to higher unit rates ($379 million), increased production in the United States ($296 million) and Trinidad ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($57 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($331 million), Trinidad ($33 million) and Canada ($20 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $23 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the Eagle Ford Shale. G&A expenses of $332 million in 2012 were $27 million higher than 2011 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($22 million) and higher information systems costs ($5 million). 39 Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $17 million to $98 million in 2012 compared to $81 million in 2011. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Eagle Ford Shale ($21 million), partially offset by decreased costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($7 million). Exploration costs of $186 million in 2012 increased $14 million from $172 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased expenditures in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs, as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other assets. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach as described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). For certain assets held for sale, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Impairments of $1,271 million in 2012 increased $240 million from $1,031 million in 2011 primarily due to increased impairments of proved and unproved properties in Canada ($534 million), partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the United States ($232 million) and decreased amortization of unproved property costs ($50 million) in the United States. EOG recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $1,133 million and $834 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2012 and 2011 amounts include impairments of $1,022 million and $745 million related to certain North American assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2012 increased $84 million to $495 million (6.2% of wellhead revenues) from $411 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) in 2011. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the United States ($70 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and a newly enacted fee imposed by the State of Pennsylvania on certain wells drilled in the state in 2012 and prior years and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($30 million), partially offset by decreased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($17 million). Other income, net was $14 million in 2012 compared to $7 million in 2011. The increase of $7 million was primarily due to higher interest income ($8 million) primarily as a result of interest on severance tax refunds, an increase in foreign currency transaction gains ($8 million) and higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($3 million), partially offset by increased losses on warehouse stock ($5 million) and higher operating losses on EOG's investment in the PTP ($4 million). Income tax provision of $710 million in 2012 decreased $109 million from $819 million in 2011 due primarily to lower pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2012 increased to 55% from 43% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due primarily to foreign losses in Canada (26% statutory tax rate) and Canadian valuation allowances. 40 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, operating expenses of $8,013 million were $2,436 million higher than the $5,577 million incurred in 2010. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 Lease and Well $ 6.11 $ 4.96 Transportation Costs 2.79 2.74 DD&A- Oil and Gas Properties (1) 15.52 13.19 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.79 0.79 G&A 1.98 1.99 Net Interest Expense 1.36 0.92 Total (2) $ 28.55 $ 24.59 (1) The 2010 amount excludes the reductions in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability of $24 million, or $0.17 per Boe, related to the acquisition of certain unproved acreage. (2) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2011 compared to 2010 are set forth below. Lease and well expenses of $942 million in 2011 increased $244 million from $698 million in 2010 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($188 million), increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($33 million), increased workover expenditures in the United States ($11 million) and Canada ($4 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($6 million), partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in Canada ($4 million). Transportation costs of $430 million in 2011 increased $45 million from $385 million in 2010 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford Shale ($30 million), the Upper Gulf Coast region ($16 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($9 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in Canada ($4 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($2 million) and the South Texas area ($2 million). The net increase in transportation costs primarily reflects increased volumes transported to downstream markets. DD&A expenses in 2011 increased $574 million to $2,516 million from $1,942 million in 2010. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2011 were $563 million higher than in 2010 primarily due to higher unit rates ($375 million), increased production in the United States ($249 million), a reduction during 2010 in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability ($24 million) and unfavorable changes in the Canadian exchange rate ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($77 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($306 million), Trinidad ($37 million) and Canada ($9 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $11 million higher in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the Eagle Ford Shale ($5 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($3 million). G&A expenses of $305 million in 2011 were $25 million higher than 2010 due primarily to higher employee-related costs. Net interest expense of $210 million in 2011 increased $80 million from $130 million in 2010 primarily due to a higher average debt balance ($56 million), lower capitalized interest ($18 million) and the write-off of fees associated with revolving credit facilities cancelled in 2011 in connection with the establishment of the 2011 Facility ($6 million). 41 Gathering and processing costs increased $14 million to $81 million in 2011 compared to $67 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($10 million), the Eagle Ford Shale ($5 million) and Canada ($5 million), partially offset by decreased activities in the Upper Gulf Coast region ($5 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($4 million). Exploration costs of $172 million in 2011 decreased $15 million from $187 million for the same prior year period primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments of $1,031 million in 2011 increased $288 million from $743 million in 2010 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment in the United States. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties and other property, plant and equipment of $834 million and $526 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 amount includes impairments of $745 million related to certain North American natural gas assets as a result of declining commodity prices and accepted bids. Taxes other than income in 2011 increased $94 million to $411 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) from $317 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) in 2010. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States ($101 million) and a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2011 for Texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions as a result of fewer wells qualifying for such credit ($8 million), partially offset by lower ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($9 million) and Canada ($4 million) and decreased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($4 million). Other income, net was $7 million in 2011 compared to $14 million in 2010. The decrease of $7 million was primarily due to operating losses on EOG's investment in the PTP ($5 million) and an increase in foreign currency transaction losses ($5 million), partially offset by higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($3 million). Income tax provision of $819 million in 2011 increased $572 million from $247 million in 2010 due primarily to greater pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2011 decreased to 43% from 61% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due mostly to foreign earnings in Trinidad (55% statutory tax rate) combined with losses in Canada (27% statutory tax rate). Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, were net funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from asset sales, net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments; and repayments of debt. 2012 compared to 2011. Net cash provided by operating activities of $5,237 million in 2012 increased $659 million from $4,578 million in 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,100 million) and a favorable change in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($531 million), partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($422 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($369 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($100 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $6,119 million in 2012 increased by $364 million from $5,755 million for the same period of 2011 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($441 million) and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($123 million), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($163 million) and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($37 million). 42 Net cash provided by financing activities of $1,140 million in 2012 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($1,234 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($83 million) and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($67 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2012 included cash dividend payments ($181 million) and treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($59 million). 2011 compared to 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,578 million in 2011 increased $1,869 million from $2,709 million in 2010 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,977 million), favorable changes in the net cash flow from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($174 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($137 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($383 million), an increase in cash paid for interest expense ($40 million) and an increase in cash paid for income taxes ($27 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $5,755 million in 2011 increased by $852 million from $4,903 million for the same period of 2010 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,084 million), unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($446 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($286 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of assets ($761 million) and the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. in 2010 ($210 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $1,009 million in 2011 included net proceeds from the sale of Common Stock ($1,388 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($36 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2011 included the repayment of long-term debt ($220 million), cash dividend payments ($167 million), treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($24 million) and debt issuance costs associated with the establishment of the 2011 Facility ($5 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 6,184 $ 5,878 $ 4,634 Leasehold Acquisitions (1) 505 301 399 Property Acquisitions 1 4 18 Capitalized Interest 50 58 76 Subtotal 6,740 6,241 5,127 Exploration Costs 186 172 187 Dry Hole Costs 15 53 72 Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,941 6,466 5,386 Asset Retirement Costs 127 133 72 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 7,068 6,599 5,458 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2) 686 656 581 Total Expenditures $ 7,754 $ 7,255 $ 6,039 (1) In 2012, leasehold acquisitions included $20 million related to non-cash property exchanges. (2) In 2012, other property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $66 million in connection with a capital lease transaction in the Eagle Ford Shale. 43 Exploration and development expenditures of $6,941 million for 2012 were $475 million higher than the prior year due primarily to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($263 million), the United Kingdom ($65 million), Argentina ($41 million) and Canada ($18 million); increased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($176 million) and Canada ($27 million); and increased exploration costs in the United States ($14 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in Trinidad ($84 million), decreased dry hole costs in the United States ($29 million) and decreased capitalized interest in the United States ($8 million). The 2012 exploration and development expenditures of $6,941 million included $5,989 million in development, $901 million in exploration and $50 million in capitalized interest. The 2011 exploration and development expenditures of $6,466 million included $5,797 million in development, $607 million in exploration, $58 million in capitalized interest and $4 million in property acquisitions. In 2011, other property, plant and equipment expenditures included $231 million for sand mine and sand processing assets. The 2010 exploration and development expenditures of $5,386 million included $4,366 million in development, $926 million in exploration, $76 million in capitalized interest and $18 million in property acquisitions. In 2010, other property, plant and equipment expenditures included $210 million for the acquisition of Galveston LNG Inc. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net realized gains of $711 million. During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net realized gains of $181 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Commodity Derivative Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2012, as a net asset of $145 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil derivative contracts at February 21, 2013, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). Crude Oil Derivative Contracts Volume (1) (Bbld) Weighted Average Price ($/Bbl) 2013 January 2013 (closed) 101,000 $99.29 February 1, 2013 through April 30, 2013 109,000 99.17 May 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 101,000 99.29 July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 93,000 98.44 (1) EOG has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for additional three-month or six-month periods. Options covering a notional volume of 8,000 Bbld are exercisable on April 30, 2013. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 8,000 Bbld at an average price of $97.66 per barrel for the period May 1, 2013 through July 31, 2013. Options covering a notional volume of 62,000 Bbld are exercisable on June 28, 2013. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 62,000 Bbld at an average price of $100.24 per barrel for the period July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. Options covering a notional volume of 54,000 Bbld are exercisable on December 31, 2013. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 54,000 Bbld at an average price of $98.91 per barrel for the period January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014. 44 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts at February 21, 2013, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). Natural Gas Derivative Contracts Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) 2013 (1) January 1, 2013 through February 28, 2013 (closed) 150,000 $4.79 March 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 150,000 4.79 2014 (2) (1) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 150,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.79 per MMBtu for the period from March 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. (2) In July 2012, EOG settled its natural gas financial price swap contracts for the period January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 and received proceeds of $36.6 million. In connection with these contracts, the counterparties retain an option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. Such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 150,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.79 per MMBtu for each month of 2014. Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 32% at December 31, 2012, compared to 28% at December 31, 2011. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2012, the principal amount of total debt outstanding increased $1,250 million to $6,290 million at December 31, 2012, from $5,040 million at December 31, 2011. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $7,032 million and $5,657 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's debt, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow. During 2012, EOG entered into a capital lease transaction for the use of newly constructed crude oil storage tanks in the Eagle Ford Shale. At December 31, 2012, the capital lease liability totaled $63 million. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2012, EOG utilized cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the Notes as further described below, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program to fund its capital programs. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2012 was $959 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2012 was $6 million with zero outstanding at year-end. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $236 million and $41 thousand, respectively, during the year 2012. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. On September 10, 2012, EOG closed its sale of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2013. Net proceeds from the Notes offering of approximately $1,234 million were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures. 45 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2012, (in thousands): 2018 & Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2013 2014 - 2015 2016 - 2017 Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $ 6,290,000 $ 400,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 3,890,000 Capital Lease 62,968 6,579 11,325 12,908 32,156 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 523,311 152,021 97,804 78,232 195,254 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,690,093 269,996 460,030 416,957 543,110 Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 5,129,835 1,582,227 1,267,751 1,111,416 1,168,441 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 263,301 167,408 86,472 3,421 6,000 Seismic Purchase Obligations 15,572 15,397 175 - - Fracturing Services Obligations 275,319 220,531 51,164 3,624 - Other Purchase Obligations 104,520 76,550 18,537 9,204 229 Total Contractual Obligations $ 14,354,919 $ 2,890,709 $ 2,993,258 $ 2,635,762 $ 5,835,190 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2012. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2012, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2012 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2012 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk. 46 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2012, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $55 million in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in an increase of $1 million to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2013 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. See ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. Including the impact of EOG's 2013 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2013 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGLs price, is approximately $28 million for net income and $41 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2013 natural gas derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2013 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $18 million for net income and $27 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at February 21, 2013, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Three Forks plays and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas drilling. United States natural gas drilling activity will be limited to that necessary to hold acreage, primarily in the Marcellus. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. The total anticipated 2013 capital expenditures of $7.0 to $7.2 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non-core assets. EOG expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for 2013. EOG's business plan includes selling certain non-core assets in 2013, realizing proceeds of approximately $550 million, to cover the anticipated shortfall. However, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2013 by 4% over 2012 levels. Total liquids production is expected to increase by 23%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and NGLs production of 28% and 10%, respectively. North American natural gas production is expected to decrease by 15% from 2012 levels. 47 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. 48 Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments. Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property-by-property basis for any impairment in value. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the future undiscounted cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows require significant judgment. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the past five years, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $34.00 per barrel to $145.00 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.82 per MMBtu to $13.31 per MMBtu. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates. Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances. Stock-Based Compensation In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's Common Stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's Common Stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 49 Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: · the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and related commodities; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; · the extent to which EOG can optimize reserve recovery and economically develop its plays utilizing horizontal and vertical drilling, advanced completion technologies and hydraulic fracturing; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, and to produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects, given the risks and uncertainties and capital expenditure requirements inherent in drilling, completing and operating crude oil and natural gas wells and the potential for interruptions of development and production, whether involuntary or intentional as a result of market or other conditions; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production; · the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; · the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG's ability to retain mineral licenses and leases; · the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water, laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; · EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; · the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; · competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services and, related thereto, the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, equipment, materials and services; · the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; · weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation of production, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities; 50 · the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; · EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; · the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; · the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; · political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates; · the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; · the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; · acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; · physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and · the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 16 through 23 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise. 51 ITEM 7A.

821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2014,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2013, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Risk Management. EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time. These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas. EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to financial transactions, from time to time EOG is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions. Under the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification, these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and, therefore, are not subject to hedge accounting or mark-to-market accounting. The financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement, which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at February 24, 2014, see ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2013, see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 All of EOG's crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development, production and transportation of, crude oil and natural gas, including rig and well explosions, cratering, fires, loss of well control and leaks and spills, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance. Insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable. Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations (subject to policy terms and conditions). Moreover, in the event an incident with respect to EOG's onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions). In the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG. All of EOG's onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors. The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations. In addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Please refer to ITEM 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject with respect to its operations outside the United States. Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis.

Risk Factors Our business and operations are subject to many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" and ""EOG"" refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. A substantial or extended decline in crude oil and/or natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us. Prices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are: · the level of consumer demand; · domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; · the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; · weather conditions and changes in weather patterns; · domestic and international drilling activity; · the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation facilities, gathering, processing and compression facilities and refining facilities; · worldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions; · the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources; · the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; · the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and · the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures. Our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. In addition, if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including ""dry holes""). As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. 17 Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: · unexpected drilling conditions; · title problems; · pressure or irregularities in formations; · equipment failures or accidents; · adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns; · compliance with, or changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, access to and use of water, and disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; · the availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses, which may be affected by (among other things) government shutdowns or other suspensions of, or delays in, government services; · the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and · the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services. Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor. Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities. Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing, compressing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of: · well blowouts and cratering; · loss of well control; · crude oil spills, natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures; · pipe failures and casing collapses; · uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids; · releases of chemicals, wastes or pollutants; · adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters; · fires and explosions; · terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; · formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures; · leaks or spills in connection with, or associated with, the gathering, processing, compression and transportation of crude oil and natural gas; and 18 · malfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations. If any of these events occur, we could incur losses, liabilities and other additional costs as a result of: · injury or loss of life; · damage to, or destruction of, property, facilities, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs; · pollution or other environmental damage; · regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean-up and remediation responsibilities and costs; · suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction; · repairs necessary to resume operations; and · compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events. We maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore operations and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable. The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In particular, in certain newer shale plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. In addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, which could in turn impact our future cash flows and results of operations. 19 We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future. Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal, state, tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental, health, safety or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, health, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years. EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. at the federal level. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. is primarily conducted at the state level (and, in Canada, at the provincial and local levels) through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions. Moreover, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations. Any such federal or state requirements, restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected. For additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation, see Climate Change - United States, Hydraulic Fracturing - United States and Environmental Regulation - Canada under ITEM 1. Business - Regulation. We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For related discussion, see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions. 20 Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. Legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs. It is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, the unavailability of gathering, processing, compression, transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems (such as title or environmental issues), nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations. 21 We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations, commercial paper borrowings, sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, would reduce our cash flows. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In addition, weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. A reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shut-ins) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. In addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us. We have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, while weakened in recent years, have improved somewhat. However, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets, and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 22 Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources. Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, gathering, processing, compression and transportation costs, severance, ad valorem and other applicable production taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant revisions or ""write-downs"" to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. For related discussion, see ITEM 2. Properties - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves. Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us. Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production. 23 In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk. We use derivative instruments (primarily financial price swaps, options, swaptions and collar and basis swap contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. Recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities. As discussed in the risk factor immediately above, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities. Although a number of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, the CFTC has issued several rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule establishing an ""end-user"" exception to mandatory clearing (End-User Exception), and a proposed rule imposing position limits (Position Limits Rule). We qualify as a ""non-financial entity"" for purposes of the End-User Exception and, as such, we are eligible for, and expect to utilize, such exception. As a result, our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing. However, it remains uncertain whether margin requirements will be imposed on uncleared swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated and the Position Limits Rule, to the extent that it is ultimately enacted, could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including costs related to requirements to post collateral), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditures requirements. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks include, among other risks: · increases in taxes and governmental royalties; · changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; · loss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; · unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; · difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and · currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 3% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. Our business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats. As a producer of crude oil and natural gas, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, refineries, rail facilities and pipelines. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to our operations. 25 Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information, systems, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information or facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, as well as data corruption, communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. ITEM 2. Properties Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves Reserve Information. For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas, as well as discussion of EOG's proved undeveloped reserves, the qualifications of the preparers of EOG's reserve estimates, EOG's independent petroleum consultants and EOG's processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates, see ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements"" represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates by different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" In general, the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. The volumes to be generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" 26 Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2013.

Approximately 0.7 million net acres will expire in 2014, 0.5 million net acres will expire in 2015 and 0.3 million net acres will expire in 2016 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions. In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. Producing Well Summary. EOG operated 16,261gross and 14,432 net producing crude oil and natural gas wells at December 31, 2013.

Also on February 24, 2014, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock by 33% from the current $0.09375 per share post-split ($0.1875 per share pre-split) to $0.125 per share post-split ($0.25 per share pre-split), effective beginning with the dividend to be paid on April 30, 2014, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2014. As of February 12, 2014, there were approximately 1,800 record holders and approximately 270,000 beneficial owners of EOG's common stock. EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock in the future. However, the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other factors, the financial condition, cash flow, level of exploration and development expenditure opportunities and future business prospects of EOG. 31 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, EOG's share repurchase activity: Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (b) Average Price Paid per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) October 1, 2013 - October 31, 2013 23,519 $ 176.30 - 6,386,200 November 1, 2013 - November 30, 2013 8,313 $ 171.15 - 6,386,200 December 1, 2013 - December 31, 2013 15,641 $ 161.89 - 6,386,200 Total 47,473 $ 170.65 (1) The 47,473 total shares for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, and the 427,409 shares for the full year 2013 consist solely of shares that were withheld by or returned to EOG (i) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations that arose upon the exercise of stock-settled stock appreciation rights or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock unit grants or (ii) in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options. These shares do not count against the 10 million aggregate share repurchase authorization of EOG's Board discussed below. (2) In September 2001, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of EOG's common stock. During 2013, EOG did not repurchase any shares under the Board-authorized repurchase program. 32 Comparative Stock Performance The following performance graph and related information shall not be deemed ""soliciting material"" or to be ""filed"" with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that EOG specifically requests that such information be treated as ""soliciting material"" or specifically incorporates such information by reference into such a filing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview EOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy. Net income for 2013 totaled $2,197 million as compared to $570 million for 2012. At December 31, 2013, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,119 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 308 MMBoe from December 31, 2012. During 2013, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 257 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 305 billion cubic feet or 51 MMBoe. Operations Several important developments have occurred since January 1, 2013. United States and Canada. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. In 2013, EOG focused its efforts on developing its existing North American crude oil and liquids-rich acreage and testing methods to improve the recovery factor of the oil-in-place in these plays. Increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and improving the recovery factor of oil-in-place are expected to continue to be areas of emphasis in 2014. In addition, EOG continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 63% of total North American production during 2013 compared to 53% in 2012. This liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the South Texas Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. In 2013, EOG's net Eagle Ford production averaged 140.9 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and NGLs as compared to 83.5 MBbld in 2012. Based on current trends, EOG expects its 2014 crude oil and condensate and NGLs production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to 2013. EOG's major producing areas are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wyoming and western Canada. EOG continues to deliver its crude oil to various markets in the United States, including sales points on the Gulf Coast where sales are based upon the Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil index. EOG's crude-by-rail facilities provide EOG the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets, including the Gulf Coast, Cushing, Oklahoma, and other markets. In December 2012, EOG Resources Canada Inc. (EOGRC) signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the planned Kitimat liquefied natural gas export terminal, the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines and approximately 28,500 undeveloped net acres in the Horn River Basin. The transaction closed in February 2013. 35 International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a) and Modified U(b) Block and the EMZ Area, have been developed and are producing natural gas sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago and crude oil and condensate sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. During 2013, EOG completed its four-well program in the Modified U(a) Block, drilling three development wells and one successful exploratory well. All four wells began production in 2013. In addition, an existing well was successfully recompleted and began production in 2013. EOG expects to drill three net wells in the SECC and Modified U(b) Blocks during 2014. In the United Kingdom, EOG continues to make progress in the development of its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil discovery. In 2013, after drilling an appraisal well, EOG determined that the adjoining Corfe field did not contain proved commercial reserves. In 2012, the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change approved the field development plans, and the Conwy production platform and pipelines were installed during 2012 and 2013. In 2013, modifications to the nearby third-party owned Douglas platform began and a crude oil processing module was installed. The Douglas platform will be used to process Conwy production. During 2013, the three-well Conwy development drilling program was completed with first production from the Conwy field anticipated in late 2014. In 2013, costs totaling $24.1 million associated with the Central North Sea Columbus natural gas project were written off. Also in 2013, EOG drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well in the Central North Sea Block 21/12b. In the first quarter of 2014, EOG drilled an unsuccessful exploratory well in the East Irish Sea Block 110/7b. In July 2008, EOG acquired rights from ConocoPhillips in a Petroleum Contract covering the Chuan Zhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. In October 2008, EOG obtained the rights to shallower zones on the acquired acreage. During the first half of 2013, EOG successfully recompleted a well and drilled and completed an additional well, both of which began production in the latter part of 2013. Additionally in 2013, EOG drilled one well that is expected to be completed and begin producing in 2014. EOG plans to drill six additional wells on its acreage in 2014. In 2011, EOG signed two exploration contracts and one farm-in agreement covering approximately 95,000 net acres in the Neuquén Basin in Neuquén Province, Argentina. During 2013, EOG completed a well in the Aguada del Chivato Block that was drilled in 2012. Also, in late 2013, EOG participated in the drilling of a vertical well in the Cerro Avispa Block. In 2014, EOG plans to complete this vertical well, participate in the drilling of a well in the Cerro Avispa Block and a well in the Bajo del Toro Block. EOG continues to evaluate its drilling results and exploration program in Argentina. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified. 36 Capital Structure One of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2013 and 32% at December 31, 2012. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On October 1, 2013, EOG repaid at maturity the $400 million principal amount of its 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013 (6.125% Senior Notes). At December 31, 2013, $350 million principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (Floating Rate Notes) and $150 million principal amount of 4.75% Subsidiary Debt due 2014 were classified as long-term debt based upon EOG's ability and intent to ultimately replace such amounts with other long-term debt. On February 3, 2014, EOG repaid upon maturity the Floating Rate Notes and settled the related interest rate swap. During 2013, EOG funded $7.2 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid at maturity the 6.125% Senior Notes, paid $199 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $64 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $761 million from the sale of certain North American assets, $56 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation and proceeds of $39 million from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity. Total anticipated 2014 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2014 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas drilling activity. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement and equity and debt offerings. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. 37 Results of Operations The following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1. Net Operating Revenues During 2013, net operating revenues increased $2,804 million, or 24%, to $14,487 million from $11,683 million in 2012. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $2,798 million, or 35%, to $10,756 million in 2013 from $7,958 million in 2012. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2013 were approximately 84% of total wellhead revenues compared to 80% in 2012. During 2013, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million compared to net gains of $394 million in 2012. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $547 million, or 18%, during 2013, to $3,644 million from $3,097 million in 2012. Gains on asset dispositions, net, totaled $198 million and $193 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. 38 Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 212.1 149.3 102.0 Canada 7.0 7.0 7.9 Trinidad 1.2 1.5 3.4 Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 220.4 157.9 113.4 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 103.81 $ 98.38 $ 92.92 Canada 87.05 86.08 91.92 Trinidad 90.30 92.26 90.62 Other International (2) 89.11 89.57 100.11 Composite 103.20 97.77 92.79 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 64.3 55.1 41.5 Canada 0.9 0.8 0.9 Total 65.2 55.9 42.4 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $ 32.46 $ 35.41 $ 50.37 Canada 39.45 44.13 52.69 Composite 32.55 35.54 50.41 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 908 1,034 1,113 Canada 76 95 132 Trinidad 355 378 344 Other International (2) 8 9 13 Total 1,347 1,516 1,602 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $ 3.32 $ 2.51 $ 3.92 Canada 3.08 2.49 3.71 Trinidad 3.68 3.72 3.53 Other International (2) 6.45 5.71 5.62 Composite 3.42 2.83 3.83 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 427.9 376.6 329.1 Canada 20.5 23.6 30.7 Trinidad 60.4 64.5 60.7 Other International (2) 1.3 1.7 2.2 Total 510.1 466.4 422.7 Total MMBoe (4) 186.2 170.7 154.3 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.

Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements). (4) Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand. 39 2013 compared to 2012. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2013 increased $2,642 million, or 47%, to $8,301 million from $5,659 million in 2012, due to an increase of 63 MBbld, or 40%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,205 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($437 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2013 increased 6% to $103.20 per barrel compared to $97.77 per barrel in 2012. NGLs revenues in 2013 increased $47 million, or 6%, to $774 million from $727 million in 2012, due to an increase of 9 MBbld, or 17%, in NGLs deliveries ($118 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($71 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Eagle Ford. EOG's composite average NGLs price in 2013 decreased 8% to $32.55 per barrel compared to $35.54 per barrel in 2012. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2013 increased $109 million, or 7%, to $1,681 million from $1,572 million in 2012. The increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($288 million), partially offset by decreased natural gas deliveries ($179 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 21% to $3.42 per Mcf in 2013 compared to $2.83 per Mcf in 2012. Natural gas deliveries in 2013 decreased 169 MMcfd, or 11%, primarily due to decreased production in the United States (126 MMcfd), Trinidad (23 MMcfd) and Canada (19 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity. The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2012. During 2013, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $116 million. During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $711 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs. During 2013, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased, compared to 2012, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2013 decreased $66 million, compared to 2012, due primarily to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities. 2012 compared to 2011. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2012 increased $1,821 million, or 47%, to $5,659 million from $3,838 million in 2011, due to an increase of 45 MBbld, or 39%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($1,533 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($288 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the Eagle Ford and the North Dakota Bakken. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2012 increased 5% to $97.77 per barrel compared to $92.79 per barrel in 2011. NGLs revenues in 2012 decreased $52 million, or 7%, to $727 million from $779 million in 2011, due to a lower composite average price ($304 million), partially offset by an increase of 14 MBbld, or 32%, in NGLs deliveries ($252 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Eagle Ford (7 MBbld), the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area (3 MBbld) and the Permian Basin (2 MBbld). EOG's composite average NGLs price in 2012 decreased 30% to $35.54 per barrel compared to $50.41 per barrel in 2011. 40 Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2012 decreased $669 million, or 30%, to $1,572 million from $2,241 million in 2011. The decrease was due to a lower composite average wellhead natural gas price ($554 million) and decreased natural gas deliveries ($115 million). Natural gas deliveries in 2012 decreased 86 MMcfd, or 5%, to 1,516 MMcfd from 1,602 MMcfd in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower production in the United States (79 MMcfd) and Canada (37 MMcfd), partially offset by increased production in Trinidad (34 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was primarily attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity. The decrease in Canada primarily reflects decreased production in Alberta and the Horn River Basin area. The increase in Trinidad was primarily attributable to an increase in contractual deliveries. EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 26% to $2.83 per Mcf in 2012 from $3.83 per Mcf in 2011. During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $711 million. During 2011, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $626 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $181 million. During 2012, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased, compared to 2011, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2012 totaled $61 million compared to $44 million in 2011. Operating and Other Expenses 2013 compared to 2012. During 2013, operating expenses of $10,812 million were $609 million higher than the $10,203 million incurred during 2012. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: 2013 2012 Lease and Well $ 5.94 $ 5.85 Transportation Costs 4.58 3.52 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties 18.79 17.71 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.55 0.85 General and Administrative (G&A) 1.87 1.94 Net Interest Expense 1.26 1.25 Total (1) $ 32.99 $ 31.12 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2013 compared to 2012 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes. Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells. 41 Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. In general, operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas. Lease and well expenses of $1,106 million in 2013 increased $106 million from $1,000 million in 2012 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($48 million) and Canada ($13 million) and increased workover expenditures in the United States ($38 million). Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs. Transportation costs of $853 million in 2013 increased $252 million from $601 million in 2012 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Eagle Ford ($136 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($84 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($27 million). DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells, reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. Other property, plant and equipment consists of gathering, transportation and processing infrastructure assets, compressors, crude-by-rail assets, sand mine and sand processing assets, vehicles, buildings and leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer hardware and software. DD&A expenses in 2013 increased $431 million to $3,601 million from $3,170 million in 2012. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2013 were $473 million higher than in 2012 primarily due to increased production in the United States ($347 million) and higher unit rates in the United States ($133 million) and Trinidad ($44 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($29 million) and Trinidad ($10 million) and lower unit rates in Canada ($12 million). DD&A unit rates in the United States increased due primarily to downward revisions of natural gas reserves at December 31, 2012, and a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $42 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 primarily in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($32 million), the Eagle Ford ($7 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($7 million). G&A expenses of $348 million in 2013 were $17 million higher than 2012 due primarily to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations. Net interest expense of $235 million in 2013 was $22 million higher than 2012 due primarily to interest expense on the $1,250 million principal amount of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in September 2012 ($23 million). This was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 6.125% Senior Notes, which were repaid at maturity in October 2013 ($6 million). 42 Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets. Gathering and processing costs increased $10 million to $108 million in 2013 compared to $98 million in 2012. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Eagle Ford ($22 million), partially offset by decreased costs in Canada ($9 million). Exploration costs of $161 million in 2013 decreased $25 million from $186 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States. Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs; as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Impairments of $287 million in 2013 decreased $984 million from $1,271 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of proved and unproved properties in Canada ($881 million), decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the United States ($98 million) and decreased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($17 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $172 million and $1,133 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2013 and 2012 amounts include impairments of $7 million and $1,022 million, respectively, related to certain North American assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets. Taxes other than income in 2013 increased $129 million to $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) from $495 million (6.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2012. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the United States ($122 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by decreased severance/production taxes in Canada ($9 million). Other expense, net, was $3 million in 2013 compared to other income, net, of $14 million in 2012. The decrease of $17 million was primarily due to losses on warehouse stock sales and adjustments. Income tax provision of $1,240 million in 2013 increased $530 million from $710 million in 2012 due primarily to higher pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2013 decreased to 36% from 55% in 2012 due primarily to the absence of certain 2012 Canadian losses (26% statutory tax rate). 43 2012 compared to 2011. During 2012, operating expenses of $10,203 million were $2,190 million higher than the $8,013 million incurred in 2011. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011: 2012 2011 Lease and Well $ 5.85 $ 6.11 Transportation Costs 3.52 2.79 DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties 17.71 15.52 Other Property, Plant and Equipment 0.85 0.79 G&A 1.94 1.98 Net Interest Expense 1.25 1.36 Total (1) $ 31.12 $ 28.55 (1) Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income. The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A and G&A for 2012 compared to 2011 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes. Lease and well expenses of $1,000 million in 2012 increased $58 million from $942 million in 2011 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($60 million) and Trinidad ($5 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in Canada ($12 million) and decreased workover expenditures in Canada ($6 million) and the United States ($5 million). Transportation costs of $601 million in 2012 increased $171 million from $430 million in 2011 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Eagle Ford ($101 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($73 million). DD&A expenses in 2012 increased $654 million to $3,170 million from $2,516 million in 2011. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2012 were $631 million higher than in 2011 primarily due to higher unit rates ($379 million), increased production in the United States ($296 million) and Trinidad ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($57 million). DD&A rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the United States ($331 million), Trinidad ($33 million) and Canada ($20 million). DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $23 million higher in 2012 than in 2011 primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the Eagle Ford. G&A expenses of $332 million in 2012 were $27 million higher than 2011 due primarily to higher employee-related costs ($22 million) and higher information systems costs ($5 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $17 million to $98 million in 2012 compared to $81 million in 2011. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Eagle Ford ($21 million), partially offset by decreased costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($7 million). Exploration costs of $186 million in 2012 increased $14 million from $172 million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased expenditures in the United States. 44 Impairments of $1,271 million in 2012 increased $240 million from $1,031 million in 2011 primarily due to increased impairments of proved and unproved properties in Canada ($534 million), partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the United States ($232 million) and decreased amortization of unproved property costs ($50 million) in the United States. EOG recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $1,133 million and $834 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2012 and 2011 amounts include impairments of $1,022 million and $745 million related to certain North American assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value. Taxes other than income in 2012 increased $84 million to $495 million (6.2% of wellhead revenues) from $411 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) in 2011. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the United States ($70 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and a newly enacted fee imposed by the State of Pennsylvania on certain wells drilled in the state in 2012 and prior years and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($30 million), partially offset by decreased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($17 million). Other income, net, was $14 million in 2012 compared to $7 million in 2011. The increase of $7 million was primarily due to higher interest income ($8 million) primarily as a result of interest on severance tax refunds, an increase in foreign currency transaction gains ($8 million) and higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($3 million), partially offset by increased losses on warehouse stock ($5 million) and higher operating losses on EOG's investment in the PTP ($4 million). Income tax provision of $710 million in 2012 decreased $109 million from $819 million in 2011 due primarily to lower pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2012 increased to 55% from 43% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due primarily to foreign losses in Canada (26% statutory tax rate) and Canadian valuation allowances. Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow The primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, were funds generated from operations, proceeds from asset sales, net proceeds from the sale of common stock, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; repayments of debt; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans. 2013 compared to 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities of $7,329 million in 2013 increased $2,092 million from $5,237 million in 2012 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,798 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($405 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($65 million), partially offset by an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($595 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($478 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($39 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $6,315 million in 2013 increased by $196 million from $6,119 million for the same period of 2012 due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($549 million); and an increase in restricted cash ($66 million); partially offset by a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($256 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($125 million); and a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($38 million). 45 Net cash used in financing activities of $574 million during 2013 included the repayment of long-term debt ($400 million), cash dividend payments ($199 million) and treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($64 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2013 included excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($56 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($39 million). 2012 compared to 2011. Net cash provided by operating activities of $5,237 million in 2012 increased $659 million from $4,578 million in 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,100 million) and a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($531 million), partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($422 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($369 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($100 million). Net cash used in investing activities of $6,119 million in 2012 increased by $364 million from $5,755 million for the same period of 2011 due primarily to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($441 million) and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($123 million), partially offset by favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($163 million) and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($37 million). Net cash provided by financing activities of $1,140 million in 2012 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($1,234 million), proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($83 million) and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($67 million). Cash used in financing activities during 2012 included cash dividend payments ($181 million) and treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($59 million). Total Expenditures The table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions): 2013 2012 2011 Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities $ 6,044 $ 6,184 $ 5,878 Leasehold Acquisitions (1) 414 505 301 Property Acquisitions 120 1 4 Capitalized Interest 49 50 58 Subtotal 6,627 6,740 6,241 Exploration Costs 161 186 172 Dry Hole Costs 75 15 53 Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,863 6,941 6,466 Asset Retirement Costs 134 127 133 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures 6,997 7,068 6,599 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2) 364 686 656 Total Expenditures $ 7,361 $ 7,754 $ 7,255 (1) In 2013 and 2012, leasehold acquisitions included $5 million and $20 million, respectively, related to non-cash property exchanges. (2) In 2012, other property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $66 million in connection with a capital lease transaction in the Eagle Ford. 46 Exploration and development expenditures of $6,863 million for 2013 were $78 million lower than the prior year due primarily to decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($137 million), Canada ($128 million) and Argentina ($32 million); decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($60 million) and Canada ($31 million); and decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($27 million). These decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisitions in the United States ($119 million) and increased drilling and facilities expenditures in Trinidad ($85 million), the United Kingdom ($64 million) and China ($14 million). The 2013 exploration and development expenditures of $6,863 million included $5,952 million in development, $742 million in exploration, $120 million in property acquisitions and $49 million in capitalized interest. The 2012 exploration and development expenditures of $6,941 million included $5,989 million in development, $901 million in exploration and $50 million in capitalized interest. The 2011 exploration and development expenditures of $6,466 million included $5,797 million in development, $607 million in exploration, $58 million in capitalized interest and $4 million in property acquisitions. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG. Derivative Transactions During 2013, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $116 million. During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $711 million. See Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Commodity Derivative Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013, as a net liability of $119 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil derivative contracts at February 24, 2014, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl). Crude Oil Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (Bbld) ($/Bbl) 2014 (1) January 2014 (closed) 156,000 $ 96.30 February 2014 171,000 96.35 March 2014 181,000 96.55 April 1, 2014 through May 31, 2014 171,000 96.55 June 2014 161,000 96.33 July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 64,000 95.18 (1) EOG has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for additional three-month, six-month and nine-month periods. Options covering a notional volume of 10,000 Bbld are exercisable on or about March 31, 2014. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 10,000 Bbld at an average price of $96.60 per barrel for each month during the period April 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. Options covering a notional volume of 10,000 Bbld are exercisable on or about May 30, 2014. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 10,000 Bbld at an average price of $100.00 per barrel for each month during the period June 1, 2014 through August 31, 2014. Options covering a notional volume of 118,000 Bbld are exercisable on or about June 30, 2014. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 118,000 Bbld at an average price of $96.64 per barrel for each month during the period July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. Options covering a notional volume of 69,000 Bbld are exercisable on or about December 31, 2014. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 69,000 Bbld at an average price of $95.20 per barrel for each month during the period January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015. 48 Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts at February 24, 2014, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). Natural Gas Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu) 2014 (1) January 2014 (closed) 230,000 $ 4.51 February 2014 (closed) 710,000 4.57 March 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 330,000 4.55 2015 (2) January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 175,000 $ 4.51 (1) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. All such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 480,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.63 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. (2) EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. All such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Financing EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2013, compared to 32% at December 31, 2012. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2013, the principal amount of total debt outstanding decreased $400 million to $5,890 million at December 31, 2013, from $6,290 million at December 31, 2012. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $6,222 million and $7,032 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is primarily at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's debt, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow. During 2013, EOG funded its capital programs primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2013 was $570 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program was $37 million during the year 2013. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs. 49 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2013, (in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2014 2015 - 2016 2017 - 2018 2019 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $ 5,890,000 $ 500,000 $ 900,000 $ 950,000 $ 3,540,000 Capital Lease 57,187 6,764 11,712 13,318 25,393 Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 433,223 119,948 87,372 68,337 157,566 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,419,340 235,635 434,713 376,314 372,678 Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 4,897,090 1,254,428 1,470,654 1,153,769 1,018,239 Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 311,361 187,115 115,241 9,005 - Seismic Purchase Obligations 10,383 10,196 187 - - Fracturing Services Obligations 319,660 162,692 117,784 39,184 - Other Purchase Obligations 62,932 42,635 17,589 2,283 425 Total Contractual Obligations $ 13,401,176 $ 2,519,413 $ 3,155,252 $ 2,612,210 $ 5,114,301 (1) This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 5, 6 and 14, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). (2) Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2013. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG. (3) Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements EOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report, and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk During 2013, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2013 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2013 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk. 50 Effective March 9, 2004, EOG entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its Canadian subsidiaries on the same date (see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements). EOG accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method, pursuant to the provisions of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. Under those provisions, as of December 31, 2013, EOG recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of $40 million in Current Liabilities - Other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to Net Income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The after-tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in an increase of $2 million to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders' Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2014 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. See ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. Including the impact of EOG's 2014 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2014 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGLs price, is approximately $44 million for net income and $65 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2014 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2014 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $13 million for net income and $19 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at February 24, 2014, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above. Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Bakken and Three Forks and Permian Basin plays and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas drilling. In order to diversify its overall asset portfolio, EOG expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the United States and Canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation-type opportunities. The total anticipated 2014 capital expenditures of $8.1 to $8.3 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under EOG's strategy of funding its exploration, development, exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non-core assets. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and equity and debt offerings. Operations. EOG expects to increase overall production in 2014 byapprozimately 11.5% over 2013 levels. Total liquids production is expected to increase by 24%, comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and NGLs production of 27% and 12%, respectively. North American natural gas production is expected to decrease by 6% from 2013 levels. 51 Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies: Proved Oil and Gas Reserves EOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Oil and Gas Exploration Costs EOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that had been deferred for more than one year (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs met the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively. 52 Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field. Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments. Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairments Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred. When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the past five years, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $39.26 per barrel to $110.04 per barrel and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $2.03 per MMBtu to $5.96 per MMBtu. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates. Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances. 53 Stock-Based Compensation In accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: · the timing and extent of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and related commodities; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and optimize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; · the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production; · the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; · the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG's ability to retain mineral licenses and leases; · the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; · EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; 54 · the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; · competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; · the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services; · the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; · weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities; · the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; · EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; · the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; · the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; · political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates; · the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; · the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; · acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; · physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and · the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 17 through 26 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.

For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2014, see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements.10Risk Management. EOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time. These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas. EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk. See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at February 16, 2015, see ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Derivative Transactions. For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts at December 31, 2014, see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements.All of EOG's crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development, production and transportation of, crude oil and natural gas, including rig and well explosions, cratering, fires, loss of well control and leaks and spills, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment. EOG's onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils, including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations. Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance.Insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable. Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations (subject to policy terms and conditions). Moreover, in the event an incident involving EOG's onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions). In the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG. All of EOG's onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors. The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations.In addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Please refer to ITEM 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject with respect to its operations outside the United States.Texas Severance Tax Rate Reduction. Natural gas production from qualifying Texas natural gas wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 is entitled to a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive months of production. However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs incurred on a well-by-well basis. 11Executive Officers of the RegistrantThe current executive officers of EOG and their names and ages (as of February 18, 2015) are as follows:Name Age Position William R.

Risk Factors Our business and operations are subject to many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" and ""EOG"" refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries.A substantial or extended decline in crude oil and/or natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us.Prices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (NGL) and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:•the level of consumer demand;•domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGL and natural gas;•the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil, NGL and natural gas;•domestic and international drilling activity;•the actions of other crude oil exporting nations, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;•weather conditions and changes in weather patterns;•the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation facilities, gathering, processing and compression facilities and refining facilities;•worldwide economic and political conditions, including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;•the price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources;•the nature and extent of governmental regulation, including environmental regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities;•the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and•the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.Our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity, the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations. Lower crude oil and/or natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of crude oil and/or natural gas that we can produce economically. Substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects, which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. As a result, a prolonged or substantial decline in crude oil and/or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance capital expenditures and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.In addition, if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties, we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. Any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control. Drilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves (including ""dry holes""). As a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells.13Specifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including: •unexpected drilling conditions;•title problems;•pressure or irregularities in formations;•equipment failures or accidents;•adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns;•compliance with, or changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, access to and use of water, and disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations; •the availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses, which may be affected by (among other things) government shutdowns or other suspensions of, or delays in, government services; •the availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, rail cars, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, transport and market crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and •the costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services.Our failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor.Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities. Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing, compressing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of:•well blowouts and cratering; •loss of well control; •crude oil spills, natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures;•pipe failures and casing collapses;•uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;•releases of chemicals, wastes or pollutants; •adverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes, and other natural disasters; •fires and explosions;•terrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cyber security breaches;•formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures; •leaks or spills in connection with, or associated with, the gathering, processing, compression and transportation of crude oil and natural gas; and•malfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations.If any of these events occur, we could incur losses, liabilities and other additional costs as a result of:•injury or loss of life; •damage to, or destruction of, property, facilities, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs; •pollution or other environmental damage; •regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean-up and remediation responsibilities and costs;•suspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction; •repairs necessary to resume operations; and•compliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events.14We maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable. The occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore operations and could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment are unavailable.The sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In particular, in certain newer plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. In addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression or transportation facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels.The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced. Maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. To the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future cash flows and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.We incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.Our crude oil and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal, state, tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental, health, safety or other considerations. Moreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, health, safety and other regulations. Further, the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Specifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Moreover, we are subject to the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in, or additions to, these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Local, state, national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years. EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, 15regulations or treaties regarding climate change and GHG emissions, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. at the federal level. Currently, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. is primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements. Any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions. Moreover, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations. Any such federal or state requirements, restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected. For additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation, see Climate Change - United States and Hydraulic Fracturing - United States under ITEM 1. Business - Regulation.We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For related discussion, see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions.Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.Legislation may be proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such changes may include, but not be limited to, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs. It is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be proposed and, if enacted, how soon any such changes would become effective. The enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us. A portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, the unavailability of gathering, processing, compression, transportation or refining facilities or equipment or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and third-party working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.If we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties. Although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties 16may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems (such as title or environmental issues), nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements. In addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further below), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates. In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.We have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. We make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations, commercial paper borrowings, sales of non-core assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings. Lower crude oil and natural gas prices, however, reduce our cash flows. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. In addition, weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings. A reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices or unanticipated well shut-ins) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay. In addition, a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us.We have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions. Domestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, while weakened in recent years, have improved somewhat. However, there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets, and there is the possibility that lenders may react by tightening credit. These conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Moreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions. Furthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production, the availability, proximity or capacity of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions.The inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. We compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services and employees and other contract personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry. As a consequence, 17we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels. We also face competition, to a lesser extent, from competing energy sources, such as alternative energy sources.Reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated. Estimating quantities of crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process. It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated. Also, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.To prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas. We also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, gathering, processing, compression and transportation costs, severance, ad valorem and other applicable taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, many of which factors are or may be beyond our control. Our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance, including any significant revisions or ""write-downs"" to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock. For related discussion, see ITEM 2. Properties - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves and Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.Weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us.Demand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production. In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. Such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression and transportation services. Such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.Our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.We use derivative instruments (primarily financial price swaps, options, swaptions and collar and basis swap contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts. 18Federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities. As discussed in the risk factor immediately above, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows. In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities. Although some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, the CFTC has issued numerous rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule establishing an ""end-user"" exception to mandatory clearing (End-User Exception), a proposed rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps (Margin Rule) and a proposed rule imposing position limits (Position Limits Rule). We qualify as a “non-financial entity” for purposes of the End-User Exception and, as such, we are eligible for, and expect to utilize, such exception. As a result, our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing. We also qualify as a “non-financial entity” for purposes of the Margin Rule; therefore, if such rule is adopted, our uncleared swaps will not be subject to regulatory margin requirements. Finally, we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the Position Limits Rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted. However, many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants may not be eligible for the End-User Exception, may be subject to mandatory clearing or the Margin Rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties, and/or may be subject to the Position Limits Rule.The Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder could increase the cost of derivative contracts, alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditure requirements. Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team.Our business and prospects for future success, including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success, depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team. The loss of any member of our management team, and our inability to attract, motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks include, among other risks: •increases in taxes and governmental royalties;•changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;•loss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; •unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities; •difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and •currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations. Our international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation. The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.19Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 4% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar.Our business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats.As a producer of crude oil and natural gas, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information or to render our information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, refineries, rail facilities and pipelines. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to our operations. Our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for our information, systems, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information or facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, as well as data corruption, communication interruptions or other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us. Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. The U.S. government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. Any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNot applicable.ITEM 2. PropertiesOil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and ReservesReserve Information. For estimates of EOG's net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas, as well as discussion of EOG's proved undeveloped reserves, the qualifications of the preparers of EOG's reserve estimates, EOG's independent petroleum consultants and EOG's processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates, see ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth in ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements"" represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates by different engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or 20downward). Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""In general, the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced. Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced. The volumes to be generated from future activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Acreage. The following table summarizes EOG's developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2014.

Approximately 0.6 million net acres will expire in 2015, 0.4 million net acres will expire in 2016 and 0.2 million net acres will expire in 2017 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or concessions. In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future.Producing Well Summary. EOG operated 9,678 gross and 8,357 net producing crude oil and natural gas wells at December 31, 2014. Gross crude oil and natural gas wells include 201 wells with multiple completions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.Net income for 2014 totaled $2,915 million as compared to $2,197 million for 2013. At December 31, 2014, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,497 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 378 MMBoe from December 31, 2013. During 2014, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) reserves increased by 329 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 298 billion cubic feet or 50 MMBoe.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2014.United States and Canada. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. In 2014, EOG remained focused on developing its existing North American crude oil and liquids-rich acreage. In addition, increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oil-in-place remained areas of emphasis in 2014. EOG continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGL to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 69% of total North American production during 2014 compared to 63% in 2013. This liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the South Texas Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. In 2014, EOG's net Eagle Ford production averaged 202.7 thousand barrels per day (MBbld) of crude oil and condensate and NGL as compared to 140.9 MBbld in 2013. EOG's major producing areas are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.EOG continues to deliver its crude oil to various markets in the United States, including sales points on the Gulf Coast where sales are based upon the Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil index. EOG's crude-by-rail facilities provide EOG the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets, including the Gulf Coast, Cushing, Oklahoma, and other markets.During the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG completed the divestiture of all its assets in Manitoba, Canada and the majority of its assets in Alberta, Canada in two separate transactions. Proceeds from the divestitures were approximately 400 million United States dollars, net of customary transaction adjustments. As a result of these transactions, approximately 150 million United States dollars of restricted cash related to future abandonment liabilities was released. The proceeds and cash were utilized for general corporate purposes. Production from the divested assets totaled approximately 7,050 barrels of crude oil per day, 580 barrels of NGL per day and 43.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Net proved reserves divested are estimated to be 7.7 million barrels of oil, 0.8 million barrels of NGL and 78.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. EOG divested 1.3 million gross acres (1.1 million net acres), 97 percent of which were in Alberta, and approximately 5,800 producing wells of which 5,155 were natural gas. EOG reclassified approximately $383 million of accumulated translation adjustments from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income to Net Income as the divestitures represented a substantially complete liquidation of EOG's Canadian operations. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. International. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a) and Modified U(b) Block and the EMZ Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. In the fourth quarter of 292014, EOG initiated a three-net well drilling program in the SECC and Modified U(b) Blocks, completing one well in 2014. In 2015, EOG expects to drill and complete the remaining two net wells in this program.In the United Kingdom, EOG continues to make progress in the development of its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil discovery. Modifications to the nearby third-party owned Douglas platform, which will be used to process Conwy production, began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014. First production from the Conwy field is anticipated in the third quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG recognized a $351 million impairment of the Conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines.In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, in 2014, EOG drilled two wells and completed two wells, one of which was originally drilled in 2013. In 2015, EOG expects to complete the second well that was drilled in 2014 and drill and complete four additional wells.EOG's activity in Argentina is focused on the Vaca Muerta oil shale formation in the Neuquén Basin in Neuquén Province. In 2014, EOG completed a vertical well in the Cerro Avispa Block that was drilled in late 2013 and determined the well to be a dry hole. Also during 2014, EOG participated in the drilling of two wells in the Bajo del Toro Block, both of which were determined to be dry holes. In the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG recognized an impairment charge of $44 million for the balance of its investment in Argentina. Management is currently evaluating options for its investment.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States and Canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 25% at December 31, 2014 and 28% at December 31, 2013. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2014, $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015 were reclassified as long-term debt based upon EOG's intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt.On March 21, 2014, EOG closed its sale of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020 (Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning October 1, 2014. Net proceeds from the Notes offering of approximately $496 million were used for general corporate purposes.On March 17, 2014, EOG repaid upon maturity the $150 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.75% Subsidiary Debt due 2014 (Subsidiary Debt) and settled the foreign currency swap entered into contemporaneously with the issuance of the Subsidiary Debt for $32 million.On February 3, 2014, EOG repaid upon maturity the $350 million aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (Floating Rate Notes). On the same date, EOG settled the interest rate swap entered into contemporaneously with the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes for $0.8 million.During 2014, EOG funded $8.4 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $280 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $127 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $569 million from the sale of assets, net proceds from the sale of the Notes and $99 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation.Total anticipated 2015 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2015 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement and equity and debt offerings.When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer EOG incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.30Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Net Operating RevenuesDuring 2014, net operating revenues increased $3,548 million, or 24%, to $18,035 million from $14,487 million in 2013. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, increased $1,837 million, or 17%, to $12,593 million in 2014 from $10,756 million in 2013. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGL in 2014 were approximately 85% of total wellhead revenues compared to 84% in 2013. During 2014, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million compared to net losses of $166 million in 2013. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $402 million during 2014, to $4,046 million from $3,644 million in 2013. Gains on asset dispositions, net, totaled $508 million and $198 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.31Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 282.0 212.1 149.3Canada 5.8 7.0 7.0Trinidad 1.0 1.2 1.5Other International (2) 0.1 0.1 0.1Total 288.9 220.4 157.9Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $92.73 $103.81 $98.38Canada 86.71 87.05 86.08Trinidad 84.63 90.30 92.26Other International (2) 90.03 89.11 89.57Composite 92.58 103.20 97.77Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 79.7 64.3 55.1Canada 0.6 0.9 0.8Total 80.3 65.2 55.9Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $31.84 $32.46 $35.41Canada 40.73 39.45 44.13Composite 31.91 32.55 35.54Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 920 908 1,034Canada 61 76 95Trinidad 363 355 378Other International (2) 9 8 9Total 1,353 1,347 1,516Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $3.93 $3.32 $2.51Canada 4.32 3.08 2.49Trinidad 3.65 3.68 3.72Other International (2) 5.03 6.45 5.71Composite 3.88 3.42 2.83Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 515.0 427.9 376.6Canada 16.7 20.5 23.6Trinidad 61.5 60.4 64.5Other International (2) 1.5 1.3 1.7Total 594.7 510.1 466.4 Total MMBoe (4) 217.1 186.2 170.7 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Argentina operations.(3)Dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable.

Crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGL to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.322014 compared to 2013. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2014 increased $1,441 million, or 17%, to $9,742 million from $8,301 million in 2013, due to an increase of 68.5 MBbld, or 31%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,558 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,117 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2014 decreased 10% to $92.58 per barrel compared to $103.20 per barrel in 2013.NGL revenues in 2014 increased $160 million, or 21%, to $934 million from $774 million in 2013, due to an increase of 15 MBbld, or 23%, in NGL deliveries ($179 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($19 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin. EOG's composite NGL price in 2014 decreased 2% to $31.91 per barrel compared to $32.55 per barrel in 2013.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2014 increased $235 million, or 14%, to $1,916 million from $1,681 million in 2013, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price. EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 13% to $3.88 per Mcf in 2014 compared to $3.42 per Mcf in 2013. Natural gas deliveries in 2014 increased less than 1% to 1,353 MMcfd as compared to 1,347 MMcfd in 2013. Increased production in the United States (12 MMcfd) and Trinidad (8 MMcfd) was offset by lower production in Canada (15 MMcfd). In the United States, increased production of associated natural gas in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin areas was partially offset by lower production in the Upper Gulf Coast and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale areas.During 2014, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million. During 2013, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $116 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2014 declined $75 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities.2013 compared to 2012. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2013 increased $2,642 million, or 47%, to $8,301 million from $5,659 million in 2012, due to an increase of 63 MBbld, or 40%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,205 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($437 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. EOG's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2013 increased 6% to $103.20 per barrel compared to $97.77 per barrel in 2012.NGL revenues in 2013 increased $47 million, or 6%, to $774 million from $727 million in 2012, due to an increase of 9 MBbld, or 17%, in NGL deliveries ($118 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($71 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Eagle Ford. EOG's composite average NGL price in 2013 decreased 8% to $32.55 per barrel compared to $35.54 per barrel in 2012.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2013 increased $109 million, or 7%, to $1,681 million from $1,572 million in 2012. The increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($288 million), partially offset by decreased natural gas deliveries ($179 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 21% to $3.42 per Mcf in 2013 compared to $2.83 per Mcf in 2012. Natural gas deliveries in 2013 decreased 169 MMcfd, or 11%, primarily due to decreased production in the United States (126 MMcfd), Trinidad (23 MMcfd) and Canada (19 MMcfd). The decrease in the United States was attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity. The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2012.During 2013, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $116 million. During 2012, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $711 million.33During 2013, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased, compared to 2012, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2013 decreased $66 million, compared to 2012, due primarily to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities.Operating and Other Expenses2014 compared to 2013. During 2014, operating expenses of $12,794 million were $1,982 million higher than the $10,812 million incurred during 2013. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: 2014 2013 Lease and Well$6.53 $5.94Transportation Costs4.48 4.58Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties17.90 18.79Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.53 0.55General and Administrative (G&A)1.85 1.87Net Interest Expense0.93 1.26Total (1)$32.22 $32.99 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $1,416 million in 2014 increased $310 million from $1,106 million in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($209 million), increased workover expenditures ($69 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses ($32 million), all in the United States.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $972 million in 2014 increased $119 million from $853 million in 2013 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Eagle Ford ($99 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($15 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and 34impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2014 increased $396 million to $3,997 million from $3,601 million in 2013. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2014 were $384 million higher than in 2013 primarily due to increased production in the United States ($630 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($191 million) and Canada ($37 million) and a decrease in production in Canada ($31 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $402 million in 2014 were $54 million higher than 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations.Net interest expense of $201 million in 2014 was $34 million lower than 2013 primarily due to repayment of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013, the Subsidiary Debt and the Floating Rate Notes ($31 million), as well as an increase in capitalized interest across the company ($8 million). This was partially offset by interest expense on the Notes issued in March 2014 ($10 million).Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets.Gathering and processing costs increased $38 million to $146 million in 2014 compared to $108 million in 2013 primarily due to increased activities in the Eagle Ford.Exploration costs of $184 million in 2014 increased $23 million from $161 million in 2013 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States.Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs; as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value.Impairments of $744 million in 2014 increased $457 million from $287 million in 2013 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties in the United Kingdom ($351 million), the United States ($145 million) and Argentina ($39 million); and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($54 million); partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in Canada ($67 million) and Trinidad ($14 million); and lower impairments of other assets in the United States ($46 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $575 million and $172 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 amounts include impairments of $503 million and $7 million, respectively, related to certain assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value.Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2014 increased $134 million to $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) from $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) in 2013. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($112 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes ($34 million) in the United States, partially offset by an increase in credits available to EOG in 2014 for Texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($11 million).Other expense, net, was $45 million in 2014 compared to $3 million in 2013. The increase of $42 million was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses.35Income tax provision of $2,080 million in 2014 increased $840 million from $1,240 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2014 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. The net effective tax rate for 2014 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due primarily to valuation allowances in the United Kingdom and deferred tax in the United States related to EOG's undistributed foreign earnings. EOG no longer asserts that foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad and therefore recorded deferred tax of $250 million on the accumulated balance of such earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014.2013 compared to 2012. During 2013, operating expenses of $10,812 million were $609 million higher than the $10,203 million incurred during 2012. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012: 2013 2012 Lease and Well$5.94 $5.85Transportation Costs4.58 3.52DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties18.79 17.71Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.55 0.85G&A1.87 1.94Net Interest Expense1.26 1.25Total (1)$32.99 $31.12 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2013 compared to 2012 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,106 million in 2013 increased $106 million from $1,000 million in 2012 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the United States ($48 million) and Canada ($13 million) and increased workover expenditures in the United States ($38 million).Transportation costs of $853 million in 2013 increased $252 million from $601 million in 2012 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Eagle Ford ($136 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($84 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($27 million).DD&A expenses in 2013 increased $431 million to $3,601 million from $3,170 million in 2012. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2013 were $473 million higher than in 2012 primarily due to increased production in the United States ($347 million) and higher unit rates in the United States ($133 million) and Trinidad ($44 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in Canada ($29 million) and Trinidad ($10 million) and lower unit rates in Canada ($12 million). DD&A unit rates in the United States increased due primarily to downward revisions of natural gas reserves at December 31, 2012, and a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties.DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $42 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 primarily in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale area ($32 million), the Eagle Ford ($7 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($7 million).G&A expenses of $348 million in 2013 were $17 million higher than 2012 due primarily to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations.Net interest expense of $235 million in 2013 was $22 million higher than 2012 due primarily to interest expense on the $1,250 million principal amount of 2.625% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in September 2012 ($23 million). This was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 6.125% Senior Notes, which were repaid at maturity in October 2013 ($6 million).Gathering and processing costs increased $10 million to $108 million in 2013 compared to $98 million in 2012. The increase primarily reflects increased activities in the Eagle Ford ($22 million), partially offset by decreased costs in Canada ($9 million).36Exploration costs of $161 million in 2013 decreased $25 million from $186 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States.Impairments of $287 million in 2013 decreased $984 million from $1,271 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of proved and unproved properties in Canada ($881 million), decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the United States ($98 million) and decreased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($17 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $172 million and $1,133 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The 2013 and 2012 amounts include impairments of $7 million and $1,022 million, respectively, related to certain North American assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value.Taxes other than income in 2013 increased $129 million to $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) from $495 million (6.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2012. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the United States ($122 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by decreased severance/production taxes in Canada ($9 million).Other expense, net, was $3 million in 2013 compared to other income, net, of $14 million in 2012. The decrease of $17 million was primarily due to losses on warehouse stock sales and adjustments.Income tax provision of $1,240 million in 2013 increased $530 million from $710 million in 2012 primarily due to higher pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2013 decreased to 36% from 55% in 2012 due primarily to the absence of certain 2012 Canadian losses (26% statutory tax rate).Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, were funds generated from operations, proceeds from asset sales, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.2014 compared to 2013. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8,649 million in 2014 increased $1,320 million from $7,329 million in 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,837 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($391 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for interest expense ($38 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($662 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($82 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($48 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $7,514 million in 2014 increased by $1,199 million from $6,315 million in 2013 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($823 million); an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($364 million); and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($191 million); partially offset by the release of restricted cash ($126 million) and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($52 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $328 million during 2014 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($280 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($127 million) and the settlement of a foreign currency swap ($32 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($496 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($99 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($22 million).2013 compared to 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities of $7,329 million in 2013 increased $2,092 million from $5,237 million in 2012 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,798 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($405 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($65 million), partially offset by an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($595 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($478 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($39 million).37Net cash used in investing activities of $6,315 million in 2013 increased by $196 million from $6,119 million for the same period of 2012 due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($549 million); and an increase in restricted cash ($66 million); partially offset by a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($256 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($125 million); and a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($38 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $574 million during 2013 included the repayment of long-term debt ($400 million), cash dividend payments ($199 million) and treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($64 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2013 included excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($56 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($39 million).Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): 2014 2013 2012Expenditure Category Capital Drilling and Facilities$6,910 $6,044 $6,184Leasehold Acquisitions (1)370 414 505Property Acquisitions139 120 1Capitalized Interest57 49 50Subtotal7,476 6,627 6,740Exploration Costs184 161 186Dry Hole Costs49 75 15Exploration and Development Expenditures7,709 6,863 6,941Asset Retirement Costs196 134 127Total Exploration and Development Expenditures7,905 6,997 7,068Other Property, Plant and Equipment (2)727 364 686Total Expenditures$8,632 $7,361 $7,754 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $5 million in both 2014 and 2013 and $20 million in 2012 related to non-cash property exchanges.(2)In 2012, other property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $66 million in connection with a capital lease transaction in the Eagle Ford.Exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million for 2014 were $846 million higher than the prior year primarily due to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the United States ($1,019 million) and China ($12 million); and increased property acquisitions ($19 million), increased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures ($18 million), and increased capitalized interest ($8 million), all in the United States. These increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in Canada ($82 million), Trinidad ($57 million), the United Kingdom ($40 million) and Argentina ($14 million); and decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the United States ($46 million). The 2014 exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million included $6,804 million in development, $709 million in exploration, $139 million in property acquisitions and $57 million in capitalized interest. The 2013 exploration and development expenditures of $6,863 million included $5,952 million in development, $742 million in exploration, $120 million in property acquisitions and $49 million in capitalized interest. The 2012 exploration and development expenditures of $6,941 million included $5,989 million in development, $901 million in exploration and $50 million in capitalized interest. 38The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.Derivative TransactionsCommodity Derivative Contracts. The total fair value of EOG's crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2014, as a net asset of $465 million. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil derivative contracts at February 16, 2015, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl).Crude Oil Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (Bbld) ($/Bbl)2015 (1) January 2015 (closed)47,000 $91.22February 1, 2015 through June 30, 201547,000 91.22July 1, 2015 through December 31, 201510,000 89.98 (1)EOG has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for additional six-month periods. Options covering a notional volume of 37,000 Bbld are exercisable on June 30, 2015. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 37,000 Bbld at an average price of $91.56 per barrel for each month during the period July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts at February 16, 2015, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu).Natural Gas Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu)2015 (1) January 1, 2015 through February 28, 2015 (closed)235,000 $4.47March 2015225,000 4.48April 2015195,000 4.49May 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015175,000 4.51 (1)EOG has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates. All such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract. If the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of EOG's existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by 175,000 MMBtud at an average price of $4.51 per MMBtu for each month during the period March 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015.FinancingEOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 25% at December 31, 2014, compared to 28% at December 31, 2013. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.The principal amount of debt outstanding totaled $5,890 million at both December 31, 2014 and 2013. The estimated fair value of EOG's debt at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $6,242 million and $6,222 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding 39interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's debt, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2014, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2014 was $345 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. The maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2014 was $31 million with zero outstanding at year-end. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $12 million and $0.1 million, respectively, during the year 2014. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2014, (in thousands):Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2015 2016 - 2017 2018 - 2019 2020 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $5,890,000 $500,000 $1,000,000 $1,250,000 $3,140,000Capital Lease 51,221 6,579 12,908 13,739 17,995Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 476,023 101,835 134,292 79,349 160,547Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,251,086 235,888 441,459 315,786 257,953Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 4,196,166 776,387 1,541,551 1,073,947 804,281Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 401,552 294,758 93,922 12,872 —Seismic Purchase Obligations 15,522 15,522 — — —Fracturing Services Obligations 392,864 173,917 172,635 38,023 8,289Other Purchase Obligations 338,197 280,634 39,582 17,025 956Total Contractual Obligations $13,012,631 $2,385,520 $3,436,349 $2,800,741 $4,390,021 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements).(2)Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2014. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.40Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2014, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2014 was the Canadian dollar. The fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in 2014 impacted both the revenues and expenses of EOG's Canadian subsidiaries. However, since Canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to United States prices, the changes in the Canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the Canadian revenues than the Canadian expenses. As previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG sold substantially all of its Canadian assets. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.EOG was party to a foreign currency aggregate swap with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may have resulted from the Subsidiary Debt. The foreign currency swap expired and was settled contemporaneously with the repayment upon maturity of the Subsidiary Debt on March 17, 2014 (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGL, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas in 2015 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of January 30, 2015, the average 2015 U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil and natural gas price was $51.86 and $2.85, respectively, representing declines of 44% and 35%, respectively, from the average NYMEX prices in 2014. See ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.Including the impact of EOG's 2015 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2015 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $63 million for net income and $93 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2015 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2015 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $15 million for net income and $22 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at February 16, 2015, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken plays. The total anticipated 2015 capital expenditures of $4.9 to $5.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its Credit Agreement and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2015, EOG does not plan to increase crude oil production in the current low commodity price environment. Overall production in 2015 is expected to decline modestly from 2014 levels, and total crude oil production is expected to be flat as compared to the prior year. In 2015, EOG expects to allocate capital primarily to its highest rate-of-return crude oil assets, focus on cost reductions and seek out opportunities to acquire high-quality acreage at low costs.41Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A. Risk Factors and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. As of December 31, 2012, EOG had exploratory drilling costs related to a project in the United Kingdom that had been deferred for more than one year (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These costs met the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.42Amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the past five years, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $53.45 per barrel to $113.39 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.82 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates. Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance 43can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: •the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL, natural gas and related commodities; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and optimize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil, natural gas and related commodity production;•the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; •the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG's ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;•the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; •EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties;•the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;•competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; •the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services;•the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;•weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities;•the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG;•EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements;•the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG;•the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions;•political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates;•the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources;•the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage;•acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; •physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and•the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 13 through 20 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.44ITEM 7A.

821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2016,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized a net loss of $4,525 million during 2015 as compared to net income of $2,915 million for 2014. During 2015, impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other assets totaling $6,326 million, $4,141 million net of tax, were recognized primarily due to the decline in commodity prices. At December 31, 2015, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,118 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), a decrease of 379 MMBoe from December 31, 2014. During 2015, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves decreased by 126 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 1,517 billion cubic feet or 253 MMBoe.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2015.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. During 2015, EOG focused on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies, testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oil-in-place and reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. These efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses. EOG continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 71% of United States production during 2015, consistent with 2014. During 2015, drilling occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and North Dakota Bakken plays, where EOG has built an inventory of uncompleted wells. In addition, EOG continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. In 2015, EOG completed four transactions to acquire certain proved crude oil properties and related assets in the Delaware Basin. The aggregate purchase price of the transactions totaled approximately $400 million. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.During 2015, due to the decline in commodity prices, proved oil and gas properties and related assets in the United States were written down to their fair value resulting in pretax impairment charges of $6,130 million, $3,945 million net of tax. Impairments were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays.Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a) and Modified U(b) Block and the Sercan Area (formerly known as the EMZ area) have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. EOG completed three net wells in 2015, finishing its SECC Block and Modified U(b) Block drilling program that was initiated in 2014. In 2016, EOG expects to complete one net well and install infrastructure in the Sercan Area.Other International. As previously reported, during the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG completed the divestiture of substantially all its assets in Canada (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At the time of the sales, production from the divested assets totaled approximately 7,050 barrels of crude oil per day, 580 barrels of NGLs per day and 43.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Information related to EOG's remaining Canadian operations is presented in the ""Other International"" segment.29In the United Kingdom, EOG continues to make progress in the development of its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil discovery. Modifications to the nearby third-party owned Douglas platform, which will be used to process Conwy production, began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014 and 2015. First production from the Conwy field is anticipated in March 2016. During 2015, EOG recognized a pretax impairment charge of $186 million for the Conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines.In 2015, EOG drilled four wells and completed three wells, one of which was drilled in 2014, in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China. The successful completions extended the Shaximiao development in the Chuan Zhong Block and provides additional opportunities in the future.EOG's activity in Argentina is focused on the Vaca Muerta oil shale formation in the Neuquén Province. Management is currently evaluating options for its investment.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2015 and 25% at December 31, 2014. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2015, $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (the 2016 Notes) and $260 million principal amount of commercial paper borrowings were reclassified as long-term debt based upon EOG's intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt.On January 14, 2016, EOG closed its sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% Senior Notes due 2026 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.10% Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the New Notes). Interest on the New Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2016. Proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes totaled approximately $991 million and were used to repay the $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Notes when such notes came due on February 1, 2016 and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of future capital expenditures.On July 21, 2015, EOG entered into a new $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (2015 Agreement) with domestic and foreign lenders (Banks). The 2015 Agreement replaced EOG's $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which was canceled by EOG upon the closing of the 2015 Agreement. The 2015 Agreement has a scheduled maturity date of July 21, 2020, and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2015 Agreement commits the Banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion at any one time outstanding, with an option for EOG to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions. On June 1, 2015, EOG repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% Senior Notes due 2015.On March 17, 2015, EOG closed its sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.15% Senior Notes due 2025 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.90% Senior Notes due 2035 (together, the Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2015. Net proceeds from the Notes offering of approximately $990 million were used for general corporate purposes.During 2015, EOG funded $5.2 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $367 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $49 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds from the sale of the Notes, commercial paper borrowings, net proceeds of $193 million from the sale of assets and $26 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation.Total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2016 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under the 2015 Agreement and equity and debt offerings.30When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Net Operating RevenuesDuring 2015, net operating revenues decreased $9,278 million, or 51%, to $8,757 million from $18,035 million in 2014. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, decreased $6,188 million, or 49%, to $6,404 million in 2015 from $12,592 million in 2014. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2015 were approximately 83% of total wellhead revenues compared to 85% in 2014. During 2015, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million compared to net gains of $834 million in 2014. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased $1,793 million during 2015, to $2,253 million from $4,046 million in 2014. Net losses on asset dispositions totaled $9 million in 2015 compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $508 million in 2014.31Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 283.3 282.0 212.1Trinidad 0.9 1.0 1.2Other International (2) 0.2 5.9 7.1Total 284.4 288.9 220.4Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $47.55 $92.73 $103.81Trinidad 39.51 84.63 90.30Other International (2) 57.32 86.75 87.08Composite 47.53 92.58 103.20Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 76.9 79.7 64.3Other International (2) 0.1 0.6 0.9Total 77.0 80.3 65.2Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $14.50 $31.84 $32.46Other International (2) 4.61 40.73 39.45Composite 14.49 31.91 32.55Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 886 920 908Trinidad 349 363 355Other International (2) 30 70 84Total 1,265 1,353 1,347Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $1.97 $3.93 $3.32Trinidad 2.89 3.65 3.68Other International (2) 5.05 4.40 3.39Composite 2.30 3.88 3.42Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 507.9 515.0 427.9Trinidad 59.1 61.5 60.4Other International (2) 5.2 18.2 21.8Total 572.2 594.7 510.1 Total MMBoe (4) 208.9 217.1 186.2 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina operations.(3)Dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable. Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements).(4)Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.322015 compared to 2014. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2015 decreased $4,807 million, or 49%, to $4,935 million from $9,742 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,677 million) and a decrease of 5 MBbld, or 2%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($131 million). The decrease in deliveries primarily reflects decreased production in the North Dakota Bakken, the Fort Worth Barnett Shale area and Other International, partially offset by increased production in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford. The decrease in Other International is due to the sale of the Canadian assets. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2015 decreased 49% to $47.53 per barrel compared to $92.58 per barrel in 2014.NGL revenues in 2015 decreased $526 million, or 56%, to $408 million from $934 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average price ($490 million) and a decrease of 3 MBbld, or 4%, in NGL deliveries ($36 million). EOG's composite NGL price in 2015 decreased 55% to $14.49 per barrel compared to $31.91 per barrel in 2014.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2015 decreased $855 million, or 45%, to $1,061 million from $1,916 million in 2014, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($730 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($125 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 41% to $2.30 per Mcf in 2015 compared to $3.88 per Mcf in 2014. Natural gas deliveries in 2015 decreased 7% to 1,265 MMcfd as compared to 1,353 MMcfd in 2014. The decrease in production was due to decreased production in Other International (40 MMcfd), the United States (34 MMcfd) and Trinidad (14 MMcfd). In the United States, decreased production was due primarily to lower production in the Upper Gulf Coast, Fort Worth Barnett Shale and South Texas areas, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin. The decline in Other International primarily reflects the sale of the Canadian assets.During 2015, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million. During 2014, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2015 declined $53 million compared to 2014, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas marketing activities and losses on sand sales.2014 compared to 2013. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2014 increased $1,441 million, or 17%, to $9,742 million from $8,301 million in 2013, due to an increase of 68.5 MBbld, or 31%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,558 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,117 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the Eagle Ford, the North Dakota Bakken and the Permian Basin. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2014 decreased 10% to $92.58 per barrel compared to $103.20 per barrel in 2013.NGL revenues in 2014 increased $160 million, or 21%, to $934 million from $774 million in 2013, due to an increase of 15 MBbld, or 23%, in NGL deliveries ($179 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($19 million). The increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin. EOG's composite NGL price in 2014 decreased 2% to $31.91 per barrel compared to $32.55 per barrel in 2013.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2014 increased $235 million, or 14%, to $1,916 million from $1,681 million in 2013, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price. EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 13% to $3.88 per Mcf in 2014 compared to $3.42 per Mcf in 2013. Natural gas deliveries in 2014 increased less than 1% to 1,353 MMcfd as compared to 1,347 MMcfd in 2013. Increased production in the United States (12 MMcfd) and Trinidad (8 MMcfd) was offset by lower production in Canada (15 MMcfd). In the United States, increased production of associated natural gas in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin areas was partially offset by lower production in the Upper Gulf Coast and Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale areas.33During 2014, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million. During 2013, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $116 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2014 declined $75 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities.Operating and Other Expenses2015 compared to 2014. During 2015, operating expenses of $15,444 million were $2,650 million higher than the $12,794 million incurred during 2014. Operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Lease and Well$5.66 $6.53Transportation Costs4.07 4.48Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties15.27 17.90Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.59 0.53General and Administrative (G&A)1.75 1.85Net Interest Expense1.14 0.93Total (1)$28.48 $32.22 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $1,182 million in 2015 decreased $234 million from $1,416 million in 2014 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($125 million), lower lease and well expenses in Other International ($99 million) primarily due to the sale of the Canadian assets and lower workover expenditures in the United States ($21 million), partially offset by increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million).Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.34Transportation costs of $849 million in 2015 decreased $123 million from $972 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($81 million) and the Eagle Ford ($48 million) primarily due to an increase in the use of pipelines to transport crude oil production, partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the Permian Basin ($19 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2015 decreased $683 million to $3,314 million from $3,997 million in 2014. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2015 were $691 million lower than in 2014 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($513 million) and Trinidad ($28 million), a decrease in production in the United States ($44 million) and lower DD&A expense in Other International ($104 million) primarily due to the sale of the Canadian assets. Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to impairments of proved oil and gas properties (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $367 million in 2015 were $35 million lower than 2014 primarily due to lower employee-related expenses.Net interest expense of $237 million in 2015 was $36 million higher than 2014 primarily due to interest incurred on the Notes issued in March 2015 ($28 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($15 million). This was partially offset by the reduction of interest on debt repaid in June 2015 and during 2014 ($11 million).Exploration costs of $149 million in 2015 decreased $35 million from $184 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($19 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses in Other International ($10 million) primarily due to the sale of the Canadian assets.Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs; as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value.Impairments of $6,614 million in 2015 increased $5,870 million from $744 million in 2014 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the United States ($5,959 million), primarily due to commodity price declines; and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($112 million), which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in EOG's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration; partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in the United Kingdom ($156 million) and Argentina ($43 million). Proved property and other asset impairments in the United States were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million and $575 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2015 decreased $336 million to $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) in 2014. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in severance/production taxes ($307 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and lower ad valorem/property taxes ($17 million), both in the United States.35Other income, net, was $2 million in 2015 compared to other expense, net, of $45 million in 2014. The increase of $47 million was primarily due to a decrease in net foreign currency transaction losses and decreased deferred compensation expense.EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015 compared to an income tax expense of $2,080 million in 2014 primarily due to impairments recognized in the United States in 2015. The net effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 35% from 42% in the prior year primarily due to the effects of recording valuation allowances in the United Kingdom and deferred tax in the United States related to undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.2014 compared to 2013. During 2014, operating expenses of $12,794 million were $1,982 million higher than the $10,812 million incurred during 2013. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013: 2014 2013 Lease and Well$6.53 $5.94Transportation Costs4.48 4.58DD&A - Oil and Gas Properties17.90 18.79Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.53 0.55G&A1.85 1.87Net Interest Expense0.93 1.26Total (1)$32.22 $32.99 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,416 million in 2014 increased $310 million from $1,106 million in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($209 million), increased workover expenditures ($69 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses ($32 million), all in the United States.Transportation costs of $972 million in 2014 increased $119 million from $853 million in 2013 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Eagle Ford ($99 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($15 million).DD&A expenses in 2014 increased $396 million to $3,997 million from $3,601 million in 2013. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2014 were $384 million higher than in 2013 primarily due to increased production in the United States ($630 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($191 million) and Canada ($37 million) and a decrease in production in Canada ($31 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $402 million in 2014 were $54 million higher than 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations.Net interest expense of $201 million in 2014 was $34 million lower than 2013 primarily due to repayment of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2013, the Subsidiary Debt and the Floating Rate Notes ($31 million), as well as an increase in capitalized interest across the company ($8 million). This was partially offset by interest expense on the Notes issued in March 2014 ($10 million).Gathering and processing costs increased $38 million to $146 million in 2014 compared to $108 million in 2013 primarily due to increased activities in the Eagle Ford.Exploration costs of $184 million in 2014 increased $23 million from $161 million in 2013 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States.36Impairments of $744 million in 2014 increased $457 million from $287 million in 2013 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties in the United Kingdom ($351 million), the United States ($145 million) and Argentina ($39 million); and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($54 million); partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in Canada ($67 million) and Trinidad ($14 million); and lower impairments of other assets in the United States ($46 million). EOG recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $575 million and $172 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 and 2013 amounts include impairments of $503 million and $7 million, respectively, related to certain assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value.Taxes other than income in 2014 increased $134 million to $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) from $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) in 2013. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($112 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes ($34 million) in the United States, partially offset by an increase in credits available to EOG in 2014 for Texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($11 million).Other expense, net, was $45 million in 2014 compared to $3 million in 2013. The increase of $42 million was primarily due to net foreign currency transaction losses.Income tax provision of $2,080 million in 2014 increased $840 million from $1,240 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2014 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. The net effective tax rate for 2014 exceeded the United States statutory tax rate (35%) due primarily to valuation allowances in the United Kingdom and deferred tax in the United States related to EOG's undistributed foreign earnings. EOG no longer asserts that foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad and therefore recorded deferred tax of $250 million on the accumulated balance of such earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014.Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from asset sales, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.2015 compared to 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities of $3,595 million in 2015 decreased $5,054 million from $8,649 million in 2014 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($6,188 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($591 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($25 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($741 million), a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($696 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($302 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $5,320 million in 2015 decreased by $2,194 million from $7,514 million in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,795 million); and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($439 million); partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($603 million); a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($377 million) and the release of restricted cash in 2014 ($60 million).Net cash provided by financing activities of $371 million in 2015 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($990 million), net commercial paper borrowings ($260 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($26 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million). Cash used in financing activities in 2015 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($367 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($49 million). 372014 compared to 2013. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8,649 million in 2014 increased $1,320 million from $7,329 million in 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,837 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($391 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for interest expense ($38 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($662 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($82 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($48 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $7,514 million in 2014 increased by $1,199 million from $6,315 million in 2013 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($823 million); an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($364 million); and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($191 million); partially offset by the release of restricted cash ($126 million) and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($52 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $328 million during 2014 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($280 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($127 million) and the settlement of a foreign currency swap ($32 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included net proceeds from the issuances of long-term debt ($496 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($99 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($22 million).Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions): 2015 2014 2013Expenditure Category Capital Exploration and Development Drilling$3,289 $5,543 $5,070Facilities765 1,367 974Leasehold Acquisitions (1)134 370 414Property Acquisitions481 139 120Capitalized Interest42 57 49Subtotal4,711 7,476 6,627Exploration Costs149 184 161Dry Hole Costs15 49 75Exploration and Development Expenditures4,875 7,709 6,863Asset Retirement Costs53 196 134Total Exploration and Development Expenditures4,928 7,905 6,997Other Property, Plant and Equipment288 727 364Total Expenditures$5,216 $8,632 $7,361 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $5 million in both 2014 and 2013 related to non-cash property exchanges.Exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million for 2015 were $2,834 million lower than the prior year primarily due to decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($2,189 million) and Other International ($74 million); decreased facilities expenditures ($553 million), decreased leasehold acquisitions ($232 million), decreased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures ($19 million), and decreased capitalized interest ($11 million), all in the United States. These decreases were partially offset by increased property acquisitions ($342 million) in the United States. The 2015 exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million included $4,007 million in development drilling and facilities, $481 million in property acquisitions, $345 million in exploration and $42 million in capitalized interest. The 2014 exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million included $6,804 million in development drilling and facilities, $709 million in exploration, $139 million in property acquisitions and $57 million in capitalized interest. The 2013 exploration and development expenditures of $6,863 million included $5,952 million in development drilling and facilities, $742 million in exploration, $120 million in property acquisitions and $49 million in capitalized interest. 38The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.Derivative TransactionsCommodity Derivative Contracts. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts at February 25, 2016, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu).Natural Gas Derivative Contracts Weighted Volume Average Price (MMBtud) ($/MMBtu)2016 March 1, 2016 through August 31, 201660,000 $2.49FinancingEOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 34% at December 31, 2015, compared to 25% at December 31, 2014. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, EOG had outstanding $6,390 million and $5,890 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,524 million and $6,242 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2015, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program and proceeds from asset sales. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2015 was $641 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was $260 million. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2015. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $81 million and zero, respectively, during the year 2015. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its 2015 Agreement described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.39Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2015, (in thousands):Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2016 2017 - 2018 2019 - 2020 2021 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $6,390,000 $400,000 $950,000 $1,900,000 $3,140,000Capital Lease 45,064 6,579 13,318 14,172 10,995Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 421,189 104,459 113,953 74,842 127,935Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,545,348 258,575 471,314 294,335 521,124Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 4,070,003 936,118 1,482,446 882,849 768,590Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 144,540 85,933 57,107 — 1,500Seismic Purchase Obligations 2,216 2,216 — — —Fracturing Services Obligations 201,501 105,957 88,287 5,412 1,845Other Purchase Obligations 91,309 40,967 33,834 15,417 1,091Total Contractual Obligations $12,911,170 $1,940,804 $3,210,259 $3,187,027 $4,573,080 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements).(2)Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2015. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2015, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2015 was the British pound. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.40Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2016 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 12, 2016, the average 2016 U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil and natural gas prices were $34.97 per barrel and $2.23 per MMBtu, respectively, representing declines of 28% and 17%, respectively, from the average NYMEX prices in 2015. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2016 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $65 million for net income and $81 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2016 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2016 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $15 million for net income and $18 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at February 25, 2016, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Bakken plays where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. The total anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows, net proceeds from the New Notes and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its 2015 Agreement and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2016, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to decline slightly from 2015 levels. In 2016, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements and lower service costs.41Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.42ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2015, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $34.55 per barrel to $113.39 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.63 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates. Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.43Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production and costs, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:•the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodity production;•the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; •the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG’s ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;•the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; •EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties;•the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;•competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; •the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services;•the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;•weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities;•the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG;•EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements;•the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG;•the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions;44•political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates;•the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources;•the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage;•acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; •physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and•the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 13 through 21 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration and extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.ITEM 7A.

821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2017,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized a net loss of $1,097 million during 2016 as compared to a net loss of $4,525 million for 2015. At December 31, 2016, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,147 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 29 MMBoe from December 31, 2015. During 2016, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 113 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 508 billion cubic feet or 84 MMBoe.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2016.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.During 2016, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling and completion efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. These efficiency gains along with realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during 2016. EOG continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 73% of United States production during 2016 as compared to 71% for 2015. During 2016, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.On October 4, 2016, EOG completed its previously announced mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation (YPC), Abo Petroleum Corporation (ABO), MYCO Industries, Inc. (MYCO) and certain affiliated entities (collectively with YPC, ABO and MYCO, the Yates Entities). The Yates Entities had recent net production of approximately 28,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 48% crude oil. The assets of the Yates Entities include 1.6 million total net acres, with approximately 180,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin Core, approximately 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin and approximately 130,000 net acres in the Permian Basin Northwest Shelf. The financial results of YPC, ABO and MYCO were included in EOG's consolidated financial statements beginning October 4, 2016. Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a) and Modified U(b) Block and the Sercan Area (formerly known as the EMZ Area) have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. In the third quarter of 2016, EOG installed a platform and pipeline in the Sercan Area in preparation for its three net well drilling program. In the fourth quarter of 2016, EOG drilled and completed one net well and began drilling a second well. EOG expects to bring the remaining two net wells of the Sercan program on-line in early 2017 and to drill three additional net wells in the second half of 2017.30Other International. In the United Kingdom, EOG began production from its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy crude oil project in March 2016, selling its first crude oil cargo at the end of the first quarter. Modifications to the nearby third-party-owned Douglas platform, which is used to process Conwy production, were completed in the first quarter of 2016 and acceptance and performance testing is ongoing.In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG plans to drill and complete four wells in 2017.During the third quarter of 2016, EOG successfully completed the sale of all its Argentina assets.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 33% at December 31, 2016 and 34% at December 31, 2015. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On October 4, 2016, in connection with the mergers and related asset purchase transactions with the Yates Entities, EOG issued an aggregate of approximately 25 million shares of EOG common stock, subject to the terms of the agreements, and paid to certain of the sellers under the asset purchase transactions an aggregate of approximately $16 million in cash for total consideration transferred of approximately $2.4 billion. In addition, under the terms of the agreements, EOG assumed and repaid approximately $164 million of debt owed by the Yates Entities, which was offset by approximately $70 million of cash of the Yates Entities.At December 31, 2016, the $600 million aggregate principal amount of EOG's 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 were reclassified as long-term debt based upon its intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt.On February 1, 2016, EOG repaid upon maturity the $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.500% Senior Notes due 2016 (2016 Notes).On January 14, 2016, EOG closed its sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.15% Senior Notes due 2026 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.10% Senior Notes due 2036 (collectively, the Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2016. Net proceeds from the Notes offering totaled approximately $991 million and were used to repay the 2016 Notes when they matured on February 1, 2016, and for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures.During 2016, EOG funded $6.6 billion ($3.9 billion of which was related to the aforementioned Yates transaction) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $564 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $373 million in dividends to common stockholders, repaid $260 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and purchased $82 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $1,119 million from the sale of assets, net proceeds from the sale of the Notes and $29 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation.Total anticipated 2017 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2017 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.31Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Net Operating RevenuesDuring 2016, net operating revenues decreased $1,106 million, or 13%, to $7,651 million from $8,757 million in 2015. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, decreased $907 million, or 14%, to $5,497 million in 2016 from $6,404 million in 2015. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2016 were approximately 86% of total wellhead revenues compared to 83% in 2015. During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million compared to net gains of $62 million in 2015. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased $287 million during 2016, to $1,966 million from $2,253 million in 2015. Net gains on asset dispositions of $206 million in 2016 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties and acreage in Texas, Louisiana, the Rocky Mountain area and Oklahoma compared to net losses on asset dispositions of $9 million in 2015.32Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 278.3 283.3 282.0Trinidad 0.8 0.9 1.0Other International (2) 3.4 0.2 5.9Total 282.5 284.4 288.9Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $41.84 $47.55 $92.73Trinidad 33.76 39.51 84.63Other International (2) 36.72 57.32 86.75Composite 41.76 47.53 92.58Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 81.6 76.9 79.7Other International (2) — 0.1 0.6Total 81.6 77.0 80.3Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $14.63 $14.50 $31.84Other International (2) — 4.61 40.73Composite 14.63 14.49 31.91Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 810 886 920Trinidad 340 349 363Other International (2) 25 30 70Total 1,175 1,265 1,353Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $1.60 $1.97 $3.93Trinidad 1.88 2.89 3.65Other International (2) 3.64 5.05 4.40Composite 1.73 2.30 3.88Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 494.9 507.9 515.0Trinidad 57.5 59.1 61.5Other International (2) 7.6 5.2 18.2Total 560.0 572.2 594.7 Total MMBoe (4) 205.0 208.9 217.1 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina operations.

Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.332016 compared to 2015. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2016 decreased $618 million, or 13%, to $4,317 million from $4,935 million in 2015, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2016 decreased 12% to $41.76 per barrel compared to $47.53 per barrel in 2015. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2016 decreased 1% to 283 MBbld as compared to 284 MBbld in 2015. The decreased production was primarily due to lower production in the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area, largely offset by increased production in the Permian Basin. NGL revenues in 2016 increased $29 million, or 7%, to $437 million from $408 million in 2015, due to an increase of 5 MBbld, or 6%, in NGL deliveries primarily as a result of increased production in the Permian Basin. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2016 decreased $319 million, or 30%, to $742 million from $1,061 million in 2015, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($246 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($73 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 25% to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016 compared to $2.30 per Mcf in 2015. Natural gas deliveries in 2016 decreased 7% to 1,175 MMcfd as compared to 1,265 MMcfd in 2015. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (76 MMcfd). The decreased production was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from asset sales in these regions during the year, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and the acquisition of the Yates Entities. During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million. During 2015, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2016 increased $91 million compared to 2015, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil marketing activities and on sand sales.2015 compared to 2014. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2015 decreased $4,807 million, or 49%, to $4,935 million from $9,742 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,677 million) and a decrease of 5 MBbld, or 2%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($131 million). The decrease in deliveries primarily reflects decreased production in the North Dakota Bakken, the Fort Worth Barnett Shale area and Other International, partially offset by increased production in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford. The decrease in Other International is due to the sale of the Canadian assets. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2015 decreased 49% to $47.53 per barrel compared to $92.58 per barrel in 2014.NGL revenues in 2015 decreased $526 million, or 56%, to $408 million from $934 million in 2014, due to a lower composite average price ($490 million) and a decrease of 3 MBbld, or 4%, in NGL deliveries ($36 million). EOG's composite NGL price in 2015 decreased 55% to $14.49 per barrel compared to $31.91 per barrel in 2014.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2015 decreased $855 million, or 45%, to $1,061 million from $1,916 million in 2014, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($730 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($125 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 41% to $2.30 per Mcf in 2015 compared to $3.88 per Mcf in 2014. Natural gas deliveries in 2015 decreased 7% to 1,265 MMcfd as compared to 1,353 MMcfd in 2014. The decrease in production was due to decreased production in Other International (40 MMcfd), the United States (34 MMcfd) and Trinidad (14 MMcfd). In the United States, decreased production was due primarily to lower production in the Upper Gulf Coast, Fort Worth Barnett Shale and South Texas areas, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin. The decline in Other International primarily reflects the sale of the Canadian assets.During 2015, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million. During 2014, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million.34Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2015 declined $53 million compared to 2014, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas marketing activities and losses on sand sales.Operating and Other Expenses2016 compared to 2015. During 2016, operating expenses of $8,876 million were $6,568 million lower than the $15,444 million incurred during 2015. Operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Lease and Well$4.53 $5.66Transportation Costs3.73 4.07Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties16.77 15.27Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.57 0.59General and Administrative (G&A)1.93 1.75Net Interest Expense1.37 1.14Total (1)$28.90 $28.48 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $927 million in 2016 decreased $255 million from $1,182 million in 2015 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs ($218 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($35 million), both in the United States.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $764 million in 2016 decreased $85 million from $849 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($55 million), the Barnett Shale ($21 million), the Eagle Ford ($19 million) and the Upper Gulf Coast region ($10 million) primarily due to lower production and service cost reductions in these regions, partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the Permian Basin ($18 million).35DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2016 increased $239 million to $3,553 million from $3,314 million in 2015. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2016 were $247 million higher than in 2015 primarily due to higher unit rates in the United States ($300 million) and China ($3 million) and commencement of crude oil production from the Conwy field in the United Kingdom ($22 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United States ($68 million) and Trinidad ($4 million) and lower unit rates in Trinidad ($6 million). Unit rates in the United States increased primarily due to downward reserve revisions at December 31, 2015, as a result of lower commodity prices.G&A expenses of $395 million in 2016 increased $28 million from $367 million in 2015 primarily due to employee-related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements and costs related to the Yates transaction.Net interest expense of $282 million in 2016 was $45 million higher than 2015 primarily due to interest incurred on the Notes issued in January 2016 ($43 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($10 million). This was partially offset by the reduction of interest expense related to the debt repaid in February 2016 and June 2015 ($16 million).Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets.Gathering and processing costs decreased $23 million to $123 million in 2016 compared to $146 million in 2015 due to decreased activities in the Eagle Ford ($16 million) and the Barnett Shale ($7 million).Exploration costs of $125 million in 2016 decreased $24 million from $149 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($15 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses ($14 million), partially offset by higher delay rentals ($5 million), all in the United States.Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.The following table represents impairments of $620 million and $6,614 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 2016 2015 Proved properties$116 $6,326Unproved properties291 288Other property, plant and equipment14 —Inventories61 —Firm commitment contracts138 —Total$620 $6,61436Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2016 and primarily due to commodity price declines in 2015. Impairments of unproved properties were primarily due to higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in EOG's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration in 2016 and 2015. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2016 decreased $72 million to $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) from $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2015. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valorem/property taxes ($49 million) and in severance/production taxes ($34 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, both in the United States. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2016 for Texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($12 million).Other expense, net, was $51 million in 2016 compared to other income, net, of $2 million in 2015. The increase of $53 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses and increased deferred compensation expense.EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments. The net effective tax rate for 2016 decreased to 30% from 35% in the prior year primarily due to additional Trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 ($43 million).2015 compared to 2014. During 2015, operating expenses of $15,444 million were $2,650 million higher than the $12,794 million incurred during 2014. Operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties, other property, plant and equipment and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Lease and Well$5.66 $6.53Transportation Costs4.07 4.48Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties15.27 17.90Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.59 0.53General and Administrative (G&A)1.75 1.85Net Interest Expense1.14 0.93Total (1)$28.48 $32.22 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2015 compared to 2014 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,182 million in 2015 decreased $234 million from $1,416 million in 2014 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($125 million), lower lease and well expenses in Other International ($99 million) primarily due to the sale of the Canadian assets and lower workover expenditures in the United States ($21 million), partially offset by increased lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million).Transportation costs of $849 million in 2015 decreased $123 million from $972 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($81 million) and the Eagle Ford ($48 million) primarily due to an increase in the use of pipelines to transport crude oil production, partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the Permian Basin ($19 million).37DD&A expenses in 2015 decreased $683 million to $3,314 million from $3,997 million in 2014. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2015 were $691 million lower than in 2014 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($513 million) and Trinidad ($28 million), a decrease in production in the United States ($44 million) and lower DD&A expense in Other International ($104 million) primarily due to the sale of the Canadian assets. Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to impairments of proved oil and gas properties (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $367 million in 2015 were $35 million lower than 2014 primarily due to lower employee-related expenses.Net interest expense of $237 million in 2015 was $36 million higher than 2014 primarily due to interest incurred on the Notes issued in March 2015 ($28 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($15 million). This was partially offset by the reduction of interest on debt repaid in June 2015 and during 2014 ($11 million).Exploration costs of $149 million in 2015 decreased $35 million from $184 million in 2014 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($19 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses in Other International ($10 million) primarily due to the sale of the Canadian assets.Impairments of $6,614 million in 2015 increased $5,870 million from $744 million in 2014 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the United States ($5,959 million), primarily due to commodity price declines; and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the United States ($112 million), which was caused by higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in EOG's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration; partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in the United Kingdom ($156 million) and Argentina ($43 million). Proved property and other asset impairments in the United States were primarily related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. EOG recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million and $575 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Taxes other than income in 2015 decreased $336 million to $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) in 2014. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in severance/production taxes ($307 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues and lower ad valorem/property taxes ($17 million), both in the United States.Other income, net, was $2 million in 2015 compared to other expense, net, of $45 million in 2014. The increase of $47 million was primarily due to a decrease in net foreign currency transaction losses and decreased deferred compensation expense.EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015 compared to an income tax expense of $2,080 million in 2014 primarily due to impairments recognized in the United States in 2015. The net effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 35% from 42% in the prior year primarily due to the effects of recording valuation allowances in the United Kingdom and deferred tax in the United States related to undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, proceeds from asset sales, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.2016 compared to 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,359 million in 2016 decreased $1,236 million from $3,595 million in 2015 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($907 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($752 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($197 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($30 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($442 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($80 million).38Net cash used in investing activities of $1,253 million in 2016 decreased by $4,067 million from $5,320 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,235 million); an increase in proceeds from asset sales ($926 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($656 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($195 million); and net cash received from the Yates transaction ($55 million).Net cash used for financing activities of $243 million in 2016 included repayments of long-term debt ($564 million), cash dividend payments ($373 million), net commercial paper repayments ($260 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($82 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($991 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($29 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million). 2015 compared to 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities of $3,595 million in 2015 decreased $5,054 million from $8,649 million in 2014 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($6,188 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($591 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($25 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($741 million), a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($696 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($302 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $5,320 million in 2015 decreased by $2,194 million from $7,514 million in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,795 million); and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($439 million); partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($603 million); a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($377 million) and the release of restricted cash in 2014 ($60 million).Net cash provided by financing activities of $371 million in 2015 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($990 million), net commercial paper borrowings ($260 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($26 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million). Cash used in financing activities in 2015 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($367 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($49 million). Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014Expenditure Category Capital Exploration and Development Drilling$1,957 $3,289 $5,543Facilities375 765 1,367Leasehold Acquisitions (1)3,217 134 370Property Acquisitions (2)749 481 139Capitalized Interest31 42 57Subtotal6,329 4,711 7,476Exploration Costs125 149 184Dry Hole Costs11 15 49Exploration and Development Expenditures6,465 4,875 7,709Asset Retirement Costs(20) 53 196Total Exploration and Development Expenditures6,445 4,928 7,905Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3)109 288 727Total Expenditures$6,554 $5,216 $8,632 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $3,115 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction and $5 million in 2014 related to non-cash property exchanges.(2)Property acquisitions included $735 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.(3)Other property, plant and equipment included $17 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.39Exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million for 2016 were $1,590 million higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased leasehold acquisitions ($3,083 million) and increased property acquisitions ($268 million), partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($1,280 million), Trinidad ($46 million) and Other International ($6 million); decreased facilities expenditures ($390 million); decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($15 million); and decreased capitalized interest ($11 million). The 2016 exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million included $3,351 million in exploration, $2,334 million in development drilling and facilities, $749 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. The 2015 exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million included $4,007 million in development drilling and facilities, $481 million in property acquisitions, $345 million in exploration and $42 million in capitalized interest. The 2014 exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million included $6,804 million in development drilling and facilities, $709 million in exploration, $139 million in property acquisitions and $57 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.Derivative TransactionsCommodity Derivative Contracts.

As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, EOG had outstanding $6,990 million and $6,390 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $7,190 million and $6,524 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2016, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2016 was $604 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2016. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $130 million and zero, respectively, during the year 2016. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.42Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2016, (in thousands):Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2017 2018 - 2019 2020 - 2021 2022 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $6,990,000 $600,000 $1,250,000 $1,750,000 $3,390,000Capital Lease 38,904 6,708 13,804 14,619 3,773Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 376,883 89,617 109,856 69,462 107,948Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,831,087 297,257 474,315 306,435 753,080Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 3,427,990 827,050 1,321,304 717,338 562,298Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 207,200 137,897 67,803 — 1,500Seismic Purchase Obligations 8,621 8,621 — — —Fracturing Services Obligations 156,345 82,178 72,167 310 1,690Other Purchase Obligations 100,608 55,729 36,359 7,669 851Total Contractual Obligations $13,137,638 $2,105,057 $3,345,608 $2,865,833 $4,821,140 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements).(2)Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2016. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2016, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2016 was the British pound. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.43Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2017 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 17, 2017, the average 2017 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $54.16 per barrel and $3.19 per MMBtu, respectively, representing increases of 25% and 31%, respectively, from the average NYMEX prices in 2016. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Including the impact of EOG's 2017 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2017 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $77 million for net income and $96 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2017 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2017 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $12 million for net income and $15 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 20, 2017, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. The total anticipated 2017 capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2017, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2016 levels. In 2017, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.44Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.45ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2016, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $110.62 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our proved reserves may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates. Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.46Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:•the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodity production;•the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; •the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG’s ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;•the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; •EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties;•the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;•competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; •the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services;•the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;•weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities;•the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG;•EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements;•the extent to which EOG is successful in its completion of planned asset dispositions;•the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG;•the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions;47•political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates;•the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources;•the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage;•acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; •physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and•the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 13 through 22 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration and extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.ITEM 7A.

821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2018,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad, the United Kingdom and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized net income of $2,583 million during 2017 as compared to a net loss of $1,097 million for 2016. At December 31, 2017, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,527 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 380 MMBoe from December 31, 2016. During 2017, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 223 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 945 billion cubic feet or 158 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2016.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2017.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.During 2017, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies using precision lateral targeting and advanced completion methods and reducing operating and capital costs through efficiency improvements and service cost reductions. These efficiency gains along with certain realized lower service costs resulted in lower drilling and completion costs and decreased operating expenses during 2017. EOG continues to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions and to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 77% of United States production during 2017 as compared to 73% for 2016. During 2017, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. In 2017, EOG completed and brought on-line two net wells finishing its program in the Sercan Area and drilled and completed five additional net wells in the Banyan and Osprey fields. EOG conducted a seismic survey in the U(a) Block, participated in a seismic survey program with a joint venture partner in the Ska, Mento and Reggae area and signed a new multi-year contract under which EOG will supply future natural gas volumes to NGC beginning in 2019.Other International. In the United Kingdom, EOG produces crude oil from its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy project. Beginning in the second quarter of 2017, production in the Conwy was off-line due to facility improvements and operational issues. EOG resumed production in the first quarter of 2018.In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG drilled five natural gas wells and completed four of those wells in 2017 as part of the continuing development of the Bajiaochang Field, which natural gas is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina. EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.31Tax Cuts and Jobs ActIn December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which made significant changes to United States federal income tax law. Under the Income Taxes Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification, the effects of new legislation are recognized upon enactment. Accordingly, recognition of the tax effects of the TCJA is required in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. As more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the TCJA made several changes to United States corporate income tax laws, some of which will have a material impact on EOG's tax provision for 2017 and subsequent periods, including the reduction in the statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, a one-time tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the conversion to the territorial system of taxation of foreign earnings. The TCJA is expected to reduce EOG's effective tax rate in 2018 and subsequent years, though the ultimate impact on its worldwide effective tax rate will depend on the percentage of pretax income generated by EOG in the United States as compared to its other jurisdictions.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 28% at December 31, 2017 and 33% at December 31, 2016. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On September 15, 2017, EOG repaid upon maturity the $600 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017. On February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to EOG's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of EOG's authorized shares of common stock from 640 million to 1,280 million. EOG's stockholders approved the increase at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 27, 2017, and the amendment was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on April 28, 2017.During 2017, EOG funded $4.6 billion ($282 million of which was non-cash property exchanges) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $387 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $63 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of $227 million from the sale of assets.Total anticipated 2018 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, excluding acquisitions. The majority of 2018 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.32Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Net Operating Revenues and OtherDuring 2017, net operating revenues increased $3,557 million, or 47%, to $11,208 million from $7,651 million in 2016. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $2,411 million, or 44%, to $7,908 million in 2017 from $5,497 million in 2016. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2017 were approximately 88% of total wellhead revenues compared to 86% in 2016. During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million compared to net losses of $100 million in 2016. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $1,332 million during 2017, to $3,298 million from $1,966 million in 2016. Net losses on asset dispositions of $99 million in 2017 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties and acreage in Texas and the Rocky Mountain area compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $206 million in 2016.33Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 335.0 278.3 283.3Trinidad 0.9 0.8 0.9Other International (2) 0.8 3.4 0.2Total 336.7 282.5 284.4Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $50.91 $41.84 $47.55Trinidad 42.30 33.76 39.51Other International (2) 57.20 36.72 57.32Composite 50.91 41.76 47.53Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 88.4 81.6 76.9Other International (2) — — 0.1Total 88.4 81.6 77.0Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $22.61 $14.63 $14.50Other International (2) — — 4.61Composite 22.61 14.63 14.49Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 765 810 886Trinidad 313 340 349Other International (2) 25 25 30Total 1,103 1,175 1,265Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $2.20 $1.60 $1.97Trinidad 2.38 1.88 2.89Other International (2) 3.89 3.64 5.05Composite 2.29 1.73 2.30Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4) United States 551.0 494.9 507.9Trinidad 53.0 57.5 59.1Other International (2) 4.9 7.6 5.2Total 608.9 560.0 572.2 Total MMBoe (4) 222.3 205.0 208.9 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina operations.

Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.342017 compared to 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2017 increased $1,939 million, or 45%, to $6,256 million from $4,317 million in 2016, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,124 million) and an increase in production ($815 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2017 increased 22% to $50.91 per barrel compared to $41.76 per barrel in 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2017 increased 19% to 337 MBbld as compared to 283 MBbld in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area.NGL revenues in 2017 increased $292 million, or 67%, to $729 million from $437 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead NGL price ($257 million) and an increase in production ($35 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGL price increased 55% to $22.61 per barrel in 2017 compared to $14.63 per barrel in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by decreased production in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in this region.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2017 increased $180 million, or 24%, to $922 million from $742 million in 2016, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($227 million), partially offset by a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($47 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 32% to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017 compared to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016. Natural gas deliveries in 2017 decreased 6% to 1,103 MMcfd as compared to 1,175 MMcfd in 2016. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (45 MMcfd) and Trinidad (27 MMcfd). The decreased production in the United States was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in these regions, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and from the 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and other affiliated entities (collectively, the Yates Entities). The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2016.During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2017 increased $9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher margins on natural gas and NGL marketing activities ($16 million), partially offset by lower margins on sand sales ($9 million).2016 compared to 2015. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2016 decreased $618 million, or 13%, to $4,317 million from $4,935 million in 2015, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price. EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2016 decreased 12% to $41.76 per barrel compared to $47.53 per barrel in 2015. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2016 decreased 1% to 283 MBbld as compared to 284 MBbld in 2015. The decreased production was primarily due to lower production in the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area, largely offset by increased production in the Permian Basin. NGL revenues in 2016 increased $29 million, or 7%, to $437 million from $408 million in 2015, due to an increase of 5 MBbld, or 6%, in NGL deliveries primarily as a result of increased production in the Permian Basin. Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2016 decreased $319 million, or 30%, to $742 million from $1,061 million in 2015, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($246 million) and a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($73 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 25% to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016 compared to $2.30 per Mcf in 2015. Natural gas deliveries in 2016 decreased 7% to 1,175 MMcfd as compared to 1,265 MMcfd in 2015. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (76 MMcfd). The decreased production was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from asset sales in these regions during the year, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and the acquisition of the Yates Entities. 35During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million. During 2015, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $62 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $730 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2016 increased $91 million compared to 2015, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil marketing activities and on sand sales.Operating and Other Expenses2017 compared to 2016. During 2017, operating expenses of $10,282 million were $1,406 million higher than the $8,876 million incurred during 2016. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Lease and Well$4.70 $4.53Transportation Costs3.33 3.73Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties14.83 16.77Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.51 0.57General and Administrative (G&A)1.95 1.93Net Interest Expense1.23 1.37Total (1)$26.55 $28.90 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2017 compared to 2016 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $1,045 million in 2017 increased $118 million from $927 million in 2016 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($71 million) and the United Kingdom ($30 million) and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($21 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $740 million in 2017 decreased $24 million from $764 million in 2016 primarily due to divestitures in the Barnett Shale and Upper Gulf Coast ($85 million) and decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($8 million) and the United Kingdom ($8 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production in the Permian Basin ($47 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($20 million) and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($13 million).36DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2017 decreased $144 million to $3,409 million from $3,553 million in 2016. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2017 were $141 million lower than in 2016 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($449 million) and Trinidad ($19 million) and a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($16 million) and Trinidad ($11 million), partially offset by an increase in production in the United States ($354 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $434 million in 2017 increased $39 million from $395 million in 2016 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($45 million) and increased professional, legal and other services ($30 million), partially offset by 2016 employee related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements ($42 million).Net interest expense of $274 million in 2017 was $8 million lower than 2016 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($4 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets and certain charges from third-party processors.Gathering and processing costs increased $26 million to $149 million in 2017 compared to $123 million in 2016 due to increased activities in the Permian Basin ($12 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million).Exploration costs of $145 million in 2017 increased $20 million from $125 million in 2016 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad.Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2017 2016 Proved properties$224 $116Unproved properties211 291Other assets28 —Other property, plant and equipment16 14Inventories— 61Firm commitment contracts— 138Total$479 $62037Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2017 increased $195 million to $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) in 2016. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($171 million) and in ad valorem property taxes ($18 million), both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States.Other income, net, was $9 million in 2017 compared to other expense, net, of $51 million in 2016. The increase of $60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 ($49 million) and interest income ($5 million).EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured, resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion. Due largely to this tax rate reduction, the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to (291)% from 30% in the prior year. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description of the income tax changes enacted by TCJA affecting EOG.2016 compared to 2015. During 2016, operating expenses of $8,876 million were $6,568 million lower than the $15,444 million incurred during 2015. Operating expenses for 2015 included impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $6,326 million primarily due to commodity price declines. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: 2016 2015 Lease and Well$4.53 $5.66Transportation Costs3.73 4.07Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties16.77 15.27Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.57 0.59General and Administrative (G&A)1.93 1.75Net Interest Expense1.37 1.14Total (1)$28.90 $28.48 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2016 compared to 2015 are set forth below. See ""Net Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $927 million in 2016 decreased $255 million from $1,182 million in 2015 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs ($218 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses ($35 million), both in the United States.Transportation costs of $764 million in 2016 decreased $85 million from $849 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Rocky Mountain area ($55 million), the Barnett Shale ($21 million), the Eagle Ford ($19 million) and the Upper Gulf Coast region ($10 million) primarily due to lower production and service cost reductions in these regions, partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production from the Permian Basin ($18 million).38DD&A expenses in 2016 increased $239 million to $3,553 million from $3,314 million in 2015. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2016 were $247 million higher than in 2015 primarily due to higher unit rates in the United States ($300 million) and China ($3 million) and commencement of crude oil production from the Conwy field in the United Kingdom ($22 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in the United States ($68 million) and Trinidad ($4 million) and lower unit rates in Trinidad ($6 million). Unit rates in the United States increased primarily due to downward reserve revisions at December 31, 2015, as a result of lower commodity prices.G&A expenses of $395 million in 2016 increased $28 million from $367 million in 2015 primarily due to employee-related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements and costs related to the Yates transaction.Net interest expense of $282 million in 2016 was $45 million higher than 2015 primarily due to interest incurred on the notes issued in January 2016 ($43 million), as well as a decrease in capitalized interest ($10 million). This was partially offset by the reduction of interest expense related to the debt repaid in February 2016 and June 2015 ($16 million).Gathering and processing costs decreased $23 million to $123 million in 2016 compared to $146 million in 2015 due to decreased activities in the Eagle Ford ($16 million) and the Barnett Shale ($7 million).Exploration costs of $125 million in 2016 decreased $24 million from $149 million in 2015 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures ($15 million) and lower exploration administrative expenses ($14 million), partially offset by higher delay rentals ($5 million), all in the United States.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 2016 2015 Proved properties$116 $6,326Unproved properties291 288Other property, plant and equipment14 —Inventories61 —Firm commitment contracts138 —Total$620 $6,614Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2016 and primarily due to commodity price declines in 2015. Impairments of unproved properties were primarily due to higher amortization rates being applied to undeveloped leasehold costs in response to the significant decrease in commodity prices and an increase in EOG's estimates of undeveloped properties not expected to be developed before lease expiration in 2016 and 2015. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.Taxes other than income in 2016 decreased $72 million to $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) from $422 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2015. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreases in ad valorem/property taxes ($49 million) and in severance/production taxes ($34 million), primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, both in the United States. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in credits available to EOG in 2016 for Texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($12 million).Other expense, net, was $51 million in 2016 compared to other income, net, of $2 million in 2015. The increase of $53 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses and increased deferred compensation expense.EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2,397 million in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss resulting from the absence of certain 2015 impairments. The net effective tax rate for 2016 decreased to 30% from 35% in the prior year primarily due to additional Trinidad taxes resulting from a tax settlement reached in the second quarter of 2016 ($43 million).39Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.2017 compared to 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,265 million in 2017 increased $1,906 million from $2,359 million in 2016 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,411 million) and a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($30 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($362 million), an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($228 million), an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($23 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($10 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $3,987 million in 2017 increased by $2,734 million from $1,253 million in 2016 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,461 million); a decrease in proceeds from asset sales ($892 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($246 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($80 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $1,036 million in 2017 included repayments of long-term debt ($600 million), cash dividend payments ($387 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million). 2016 compared to 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2,359 million in 2016 decreased $1,236 million from $3,595 million in 2015 primarily reflecting a decrease in wellhead revenues ($907 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($752 million), unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($197 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($30 million), partially offset by a decrease in cash operating expenses ($442 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($80 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $1,253 million in 2016 decreased by $4,067 million from $5,320 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,235 million); an increase in proceeds from asset sales ($926 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($656 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($195 million); and net cash received from the Yates transaction ($55 million).Net cash used for financing activities of $243 million in 2016 included repayments of long-term debt ($564 million), cash dividend payments ($373 million), net commercial paper repayments ($260 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($82 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 included net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes ($991 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($29 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($23 million). 40Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015Expenditure Category Capital Exploration and Development Drilling$3,132 $1,957 $3,289Facilities575 375 765Leasehold Acquisitions (1)427 3,217 134Property Acquisitions (2)73 749 481Capitalized Interest27 31 42Subtotal4,234 6,329 4,711Exploration Costs145 125 149Dry Hole Costs5 11 15Exploration and Development Expenditures4,384 6,465 4,875Asset Retirement Costs56 (20) 53Total Exploration and Development Expenditures4,440 6,445 4,928Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3)173 109 288Total Expenditures$4,613 $6,554 $5,216 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $256 million in 2017 related to non-cash property exchanges and $3,115 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.(2)Property acquisitions included $26 million in 2017 related to non-cash property exchanges and $735 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.(3)Other property, plant and equipment included $17 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.Exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million for 2017 were $2,081 million lower than the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased leasehold acquisitions ($2,790 million) and decreased property acquisitions ($676 million), partially offset by increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($1,052 million), Trinidad ($106 million) and Other International ($17 million); increased facilities expenditures ($200 million); and increased geological and geophysical expenditures ($20 million). The 2017 exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million included $3,661 million in development drilling and facilities, $623 million in exploration, $73 million in property acquisitions and $27 million in capitalized interest. The 2016 exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million included $3,351 million in exploration, $2,334 million in development drilling and facilities, $749 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. The 2015 exploration and development expenditures of $4,875 million included $4,007 million in development drilling and facilities, $481 million in property acquisitions, $345 million in exploration and $42 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.41Derivative TransactionsCommodity Derivative Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Midland, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Midland Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Midland Differential basis swap contracts through February 20, 2018.

The call options require that EOG pay the difference between the call option strike price and either the average or last business day NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price for the contract month (Henry Hub Index Price) in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is above the call option strike price. In addition, EOG has purchased put options which establish a floor price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the put option contracts. The put options grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the put option strike price and the Henry Hub Index Price in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is below the put option strike price.

As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, EOG had outstanding $6,390 million and $6,990 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,602 million and $7,190 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2017, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2017 was $803 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2017. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $84 million during the year 2017. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, (in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 2023 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $6,390,000 $350,000 $1,900,000 $750,000 $3,390,000Capital Lease 32,220 6,644 14,172 11,404 —Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 437,597 118,412 118,583 88,039 112,563Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,533,624 261,601 382,085 258,139 631,799Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) 3,992,137 883,489 1,403,647 896,607 808,394Drilling Rig Commitments (3) 245,434 229,372 14,562 1,500 —Seismic Purchase Obligations 19,596 19,596 — — —Fracturing Services Obligations 688,924 338,825 292,845 34,206 23,048Other Purchase Obligations 331,620 265,311 39,435 25,968 906Total Contractual Obligations $13,671,152 $2,473,250 $4,165,329 $2,065,863 $4,966,710 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, repatriation tax liability, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements).(2)Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars and British pounds into United States dollars at December 31, 2017. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(3)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).44Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2017, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, the United Kingdom, China and Canada. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2017 was the British pound. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2018 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 20, 2018, the average 2018 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $60.75 per barrel and $2.81 per MMBtu, respectively, representing an increase of 19% for crude oil and a decrease of 9% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2017. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Including the impact of EOG's 2018 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2018 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $82 million for net income and $106 million for cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's 2018 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of call options) and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2018 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $22 million for net income and $29 million for cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 20, 2018, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. The total anticipated 2018 capital expenditures of approximately $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2018, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2017 levels. In 2018, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.45Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.46ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2017, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $110.62 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our proved reserves may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates. Changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the TCJA, which made significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law. Shortly after enactment of the TCJA, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the TCJA. Under SAB 118, an entity would use a similar approach as the measurement period provided in the Business Combinations Topic of the ASC. An entity will recognize those matters for which the accounting can be completed. For matters that have not been completed, the entity would either (1) recognize provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information becomes available or (2) for any specific income tax effects of the TCJA for which a reasonable estimate cannot be determined, continue to apply the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the TCJA was signed into law. EOG has prepared its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the ASC as allowed by SAB 118. Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).47Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:•the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodity production;•the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; •the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG’s ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;•the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; •EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties;•the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;•competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; •the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services;•the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;•weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities;•the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG;•EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements;•the extent to which EOG is successful in its completion of planned asset dispositions;•the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG;•the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions;48•political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates;•the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources;•the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage;•acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; •physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and•the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 14 through 23 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2019,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized net income of $3,419 million during 2018 as compared to net income of $2,583 million for 2017. At December 31, 2018, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 2,928 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 401 MMBoe from December 31, 2017. During 2018, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 330 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 424 billion cubic feet or 71 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2017.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2018.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.During 2018, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGL production accounted for approximately 77% of United States production during 2018 and 2017. During 2018, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its successor, Heritage Petroleum Company Limited. In 2018, EOG conducted an ocean bottom nodal seismic survey in the SECC Block and the Pelican Field and continued to process and review the initial data. Other International. In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG entered 2018 with two drilled uncompleted wells and completed both wells. In addition, EOG drilled five natural gas wells and completed one of those wells in 2018 as part of the continuing development of the Bajiaochang Field, which natural gas is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina. In the U.K., EOG produced crude oil from its 100% working interest East Irish Sea Conwy development project. EOG completed the sale of all of its interest in EOG Resources United Kingdom Limited during the fourth quarter of 2018. EOG no longer has any presence in the U.K.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.29Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 24% at December 31, 2018 and 28% at December 31, 2017. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On October 1, 2018, EOG repaid upon maturity the $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018. During 2018, EOG funded $6.6 billion ($411 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $350 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $438 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $63 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of $227 million from the sale of assets.Total anticipated 2019 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges. The majority of 2019 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. 30Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Operating Revenues and OtherDuring 2018, operating revenues increased $6,067 million, or 54%, to $17,275 million from $11,208 million in 2017. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $4,039 million, or 51%, to $11,946 million in 2018 from $7,907 million in 2017. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2018 were approximately 89% of total wellhead revenues compared to 88% in 2017. During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million compared to net gains of $20 million in 2017. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $1,932 million during 2018, to $5,230 million from $3,298 million in 2017. Net gains on asset dispositions of $175 million in 2018 were primarily as a result of exchanges of producing properties and acreage in Texas and sales of producing properties and acreage in the United Kingdom, Texas and the Rocky Mountain area compared to net losses on asset dispositions of $99 million in 2017.31Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 394.8 335.0 278.3Trinidad 0.8 0.9 0.8Other International (2) 4.3 0.8 3.4Total 399.9 336.7 282.5Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $65.16 $50.91 $41.84Trinidad 57.26 42.30 33.76Other International (2) 71.45 57.20 36.72Composite 65.21 50.91 41.76Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 116.1 88.4 81.6Other International (2) — — —Total 116.1 88.4 81.6Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $26.60 $22.61 $14.63Other International (2) — — —Composite 26.60 22.61 14.63Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 923 765 810Trinidad 266 313 340Other International (2) 30 25 25Total 1,219 1,103 1,175Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $2.88 $2.20 $1.60Trinidad 2.94 2.38 1.88Other International (2) 4.08 3.89 3.64Composite 2.92(4)2.29 1.73Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (5) United States 664.7 551.0 494.9Trinidad 45.1 53.0 57.5Other International (2) 9.4 4.9 7.6Total 719.2 608.9 560.0 Total MMBoe (5) 262.5 222.3 205.0 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China, Canada and Argentina operations.

In connection with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, EOG presents natural gas processing fees related to certain processing and marketing agreements as Gathering and Processing Costs, instead of as a deduction to Natural Gas revenues.(5)Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.322018 compared to 2017. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2018 increased $3,261 million, or 52%, to $9,517 million from $6,256 million in 2017, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($2,088 million) and an increase in production ($1,173 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2018 increased 28% to $65.21 per barrel compared to $50.91 per barrel in 2017. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2018 increased 19% to 400 MBbld as compared to 337 MBbld in 2017. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.NGL revenues in 2018 increased $398 million, or 55%, to $1,127 million from $729 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production ($229 million) and a higher composite average wellhead NGL price ($169 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGL price increased 18% to $26.60 per barrel in 2018 compared to $22.61 per barrel in 2017. NGL production in 2018 increased 31% to 116 MBbld as compared to 88 MBbld in 2017. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2018 increased $380 million, or 41%, to $1,302 million from $922 million in 2017, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($282 million) and an increase in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($98 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 28% to $2.92 per Mcf in 2018 compared to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017. This increase in composite wellhead natural gas prices includes a positive revenue adjustment of $0.44 per Mcf related to the adoption of ASU 2014-09. Natural gas deliveries in 2018 increased 11% to 1,219 MMcfd as compared to 1,103 MMcfd in 2017. The increase in production was primarily due to increased production in the United States (158 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Trinidad (47 MMcfd). The increased production in the United States was due primarily to increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and higher volumes in the Marcellus Shale. The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2017.During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $259 million. During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2018 increased $59 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities.2017 compared to 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2017 increased $1,939 million, or 45%, to $6,256 million from $4,317 million in 2016, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,124 million) and an increase in production ($815 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2017 increased 22% to $50.91 per barrel compared to $41.76 per barrel in 2016. Wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries in 2017 increased 19% to 337 MBbld as compared to 283 MBbld in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area.NGL revenues in 2017 increased $292 million, or 67%, to $729 million from $437 million in 2016 primarily due to a higher composite wellhead NGL price ($257 million) and an increase in production ($35 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGL price increased 55% to $22.61 per barrel in 2017 compared to $14.63 per barrel in 2016. The increased production was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by decreased production in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in this region.33Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2017 increased $180 million, or 24%, to $922 million from $742 million in 2016, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($227 million), partially offset by a decrease in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($47 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 32% to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017 compared to $1.73 per Mcf in 2016. Natural gas deliveries in 2017 decreased 6% to 1,103 MMcfd as compared to 1,175 MMcfd in 2016. The decrease in production was primarily due to decreased production in the United States (45 MMcfd) and Trinidad (27 MMcfd). The decreased production in the United States was due primarily to lower volumes in the Fort Worth Barnett Shale, Upper Gulf Coast and South Texas areas, largely resulting from 2016 asset sales in these regions, partially offset by increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and from the 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and other affiliated entities (collectively, the Yates Entities). The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2016.During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. During 2016, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $100 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $22 million.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2017 increased $9 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher margins on natural gas and NGL marketing activities ($16 million), partially offset by lower margins on sand sales ($9 million).Operating and Other Expenses2018 compared to 2017. During 2018, operating expenses of $12,806 million were $2,524 million higher than the $10,282 million incurred during 2017. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Lease and Well$4.89 $4.70Transportation Costs2.85 3.33Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties12.65 14.83Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.44 0.51General and Administrative (G&A)1.63 1.95Net Interest Expense0.93 1.23Total (1)$23.39 $26.55 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2018 compared to 2017 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 34Lease and well expenses of $1,283 million in 2018 increased $238 million from $1,045 million in 2017 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($171 million), higher workover expenditures ($44 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($41 million), all in the United States, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the United Kingdom ($18 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $747 million in 2018 increased $7 million from $740 million in 2017 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($116 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Barnett Shale ($52 million), the Eagle Ford ($31 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($25 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2018 increased $26 million to $3,435 million from $3,409 million in 2017. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2018 were $24 million higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($647 million) and the United Kingdom ($21 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($625 million) and a decrease in production in Trinidad ($16 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $427 million in 2018 decreased $7 million from $434 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased professional, legal and other services ($24 million); partially offset by increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations ($15 million) and increased information systems costs ($10 million).Net interest expense of $245 million in 2018 was $29 million lower than 2017 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($25 million) and the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in October 2018 ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($3 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets and beginning January 1, 2018, natural gas processing fees from third parties. EOG pays third parties to process a portion of its natural gas production to extract NGLs. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion related to EOG's adoption of ASU 2014-09.Gathering and processing costs increased $288 million to $437 million in 2018 compared to $149 million in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 ($204 million) and increased operating costs in the Permian Basin ($32 million), the United Kingdom ($28 million) and the Eagle Ford ($25 million).Exploration costs of $149 million in 2018 increased $4 million from $145 million in 2017 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million), partially offset by decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad ($5 million).35Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions): 2018 2017 Proved properties$121 $224Unproved properties173 211Other assets49 28Other property, plant and equipment— 16Inventories4 —Total$347 $479Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2018 and 2017. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2018 increased $227 million to $772 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) in 2017. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($190 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and an increase in ad valorem/property taxes ($33 million), both in the United States.Other income, net, was $17 million in 2018 compared to other income, net, of $9 million in 2017. The increase of $8 million in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation expense ($12 million) and an increase in interest income ($4 million); partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses ($15 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $822 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017, primarily due to the absence of certain 2017 tax benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and higher pretax income. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit in 2017 of approximately $2.2 billion. The net effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 19% from (291%) in the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the TCJA tax benefits.362017 compared to 2016. During 2017, operating expenses of $10,282 million were $1,406 million higher than the $8,876 million incurred during 2016. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: 2017 2016 Lease and Well$4.70 $4.53Transportation Costs3.33 3.73Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties14.83 16.77Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.51 0.57General and Administrative (G&A)1.95 1.93Net Interest Expense1.23 1.37Total (1)$26.55 $28.90 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2017 compared to 2016 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,045 million in 2017 increased $118 million from $927 million in 2016 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($71 million) and the United Kingdom ($30 million) and higher workover expenditures in the United States ($21 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.Transportation costs of $740 million in 2017 decreased $24 million from $764 million in 2016 primarily due to divestitures in the Barnett Shale and Upper Gulf Coast ($85 million) and decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($8 million) and the United Kingdom ($8 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs related to higher production in the Permian Basin ($47 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($20 million) and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($13 million).DD&A expenses in 2017 decreased $144 million to $3,409 million from $3,553 million in 2016. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2017 were $141 million lower than in 2016 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($449 million) and Trinidad ($19 million) and a decrease in production in the United Kingdom ($16 million) and Trinidad ($11 million), partially offset by an increase in production in the United States ($354 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $434 million in 2017 increased $39 million from $395 million in 2016 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations and from the 2016 transactions with the Yates Entities ($45 million) and increased professional, legal and other services ($30 million), partially offset by 2016 employee related expenses in connection with certain voluntary retirements ($42 million).Net interest expense of $274 million in 2017 was $8 million lower than 2016 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($11 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($4 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $26 million to $149 million in 2017 compared to $123 million in 2016 due to increased activities in the Permian Basin ($12 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million).Exploration costs of $145 million in 2017 increased $20 million from $125 million in 2016 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad.37The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2017 2016 Proved properties$224 $116Unproved properties211 291Other assets28 —Other property, plant and equipment16 14Inventories— 61Firm commitment contracts— 138Total$479 $620Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of divested legacy natural gas assets in 2017 and 2016. EOG recognized additional impairment charges in 2016 of $61 million related to obsolete inventory and $138 million related to firm commitment contracts related to divested Haynesville natural gas assets.Taxes other than income in 2017 increased $195 million to $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $350 million (6.4% of wellhead revenues) in 2016. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($171 million) and in ad valorem/property taxes ($18 million), both primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues in the United States.Other income, net, was $9 million in 2017 compared to other expense, net, of $51 million in 2016. The increase of $60 million was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction gains in 2017 ($49 million) and interest income ($5 million).EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017 compared to an income tax benefit of $461 million in 2016, primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured, resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of approximately $2.2 billion. Due largely to this tax rate reduction, the net effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to (291)% from 30% in the prior year. Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; repayments of debt; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.2018 compared to 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities of $7,769 million in 2018 increased $3,504 million from $4,265 million in 2017 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($4,039 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($758 million) and a favorable change in the cash paid for income taxes ($113 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($746 million) and an unfavorable change in the net cash paid for the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($266 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $6,170 million in 2018 increased by $2,183 million from $3,987 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,888 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($211 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($64 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $839 million in 2018 included cash dividend payments ($438 million), repayments of long-term debt ($350 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2018 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million). 382017 compared to 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4,265 million in 2017 increased $1,906 million from $2,359 million in 2016 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,411 million) and a favorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($30 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($362 million), an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($228 million), an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($23 million) and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($10 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $3,987 million in 2017 increased by $2,734 million from $1,253 million in 2016 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,461 million); a decrease in proceeds from asset sales ($892 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($246 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($80 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $1,036 million in 2017 included repayments of long-term debt ($600 million), cash dividend payments ($387 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million). Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016Expenditure Category Capital Exploration and Development Drilling$4,935 $3,132 $1,957Facilities625 575 375Leasehold Acquisitions (1)488 427 3,217Property Acquisitions (2)124 73 749Capitalized Interest24 27 31Subtotal6,196 4,234 6,329Exploration Costs149 145 125Dry Hole Costs5 5 11Exploration and Development Expenditures6,350 4,384 6,465Asset Retirement Costs70 56 (20)Total Exploration and Development Expenditures6,420 4,440 6,445Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3)286 173 109Total Expenditures$6,706 $4,613 $6,554 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $291 million and $256 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $3,115 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.(2)Property acquisitions included $71 million and $26 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $735 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.(3)Other property, plant and equipment included $49 million of non-cash additions in 2018 primarily related to a capital lease transaction in the Permian Basin and $17 million in 2016 related to the Yates transaction.Exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million for 2018 were $1,966 million higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($1,932 million) and Other International ($11 million), increased leasehold acquisitions ($61 million), increased property acquisitions ($51 million) and increased facility expenditures ($50 million), partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in Trinidad ($140 million). The 2018 exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million included $5,546 million in development drilling and facilities, $656 million in exploration, $124 million in property acquisitions and $24 million in capitalized interest. The 2017 exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million included $3,661 million in development drilling and facilities, $623 million in exploration, $73 million in property acquisitions and $27 million in capitalized interest. The 2016 exploration and development expenditures of $6,465 million included $3,351 million in exploration, $2,334 million in development drilling and facilities, $749 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. 39The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.Derivative TransactionsCommodity Derivative Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Midland, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Midland Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Midland Differential basis swap contracts through February 19, 2019. The weighted average price differential expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) represents the amount of reduction to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) covered by the basis swap contracts.

These contracts offset the crude oil price swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of 134,000 Bbld at an average price of $60.04 per Bbl. The net cash EOG received for settling these contracts was $26.1 million. The offsetting contracts are excluded from the above table.Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas price swap contracts through February 19, 2019, with notional volumes expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu). Natural Gas Price Swap Contracts Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) 2018 March 1, 2018 through November 30, 2018 (closed) 35,000 $3.00EOG has sold call options which establish a ceiling price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the call option contracts. The call options require that EOG pay the difference between the call option strike price and either the average or last business day NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price for the contract month (Henry Hub Index Price) in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is above the call option strike price. In addition, EOG has purchased put options which establish a floor price for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the put option contracts. The put options grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the put option strike price and the Henry Hub Index Price in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is below the put option strike price. Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas call and put option contracts through February 19, 2019, with notional volumes expressed in MMBtud and prices expressed in $/MMBtu.Natural Gas Option Contracts Call Options Sold Put Options Purchased Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu) Volume (MMBtud) Weighted Average Price ($/MMBtu)2018 March 1, 2018 through November 30, 2018 (closed)120,000 $3.38 96,000 $2.94FinancingEOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 24% at December 31, 2018, compared to 28% at December 31, 2017. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, EOG had outstanding $6,040 million and $6,390 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,027 million and $6,602 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2018, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2018 was $208 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2018. The average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program were $8 million during the year 2018. EOG considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.41Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2018, (in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) (2) Total 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 2024 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $6,040,000 $900,000 $1,750,000 $1,250,000 $2,140,000Capital Lease 71,571 13,384 27,560 17,529 13,098Non-Cancelable Operating Leases 555,692 175,787 218,995 90,608 70,302Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease 1,276,530 213,776 308,379 227,185 527,190Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (3) 3,781,178 898,491 1,370,060 880,057 632,570Drilling Rig Commitments (4) 391,459 262,404 126,398 2,657 —Seismic Purchase Obligations 6,898 6,898 — — —Fracturing Services Obligations 1,048,517 421,873 460,088 164,041 2,515Other Purchase Obligations 1,024,301 385,525 237,771 175,250 225,755Total Contractual Obligations $14,196,146 $3,278,138 $4,499,251 $2,807,327 $3,611,430 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). These amounts are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.(2)This table does not include the liability for commitments to purchase fixed quantities of crude oil and natural gas. The amounts are excluded because they are variable and based on future commodity prices. At December 31, 2018, EOG is committed to purchase 3.6 MMBbls of crude oil and 15 Bcf of natural gas in 2019.(3)Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2018. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(4)Amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. EOG's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent EOG utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if EOG utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2018, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, China and Canada and, through November 2018, the U.K. The foreign currency most significant to EOG's operations during 2018 was the British pound. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.42Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2019 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 19, 2019, the average 2019 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $57.15 per barrel and $2.89 per MMBtu, respectively, representing a decrease of 12% for crude oil and a decrease of 6% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2018. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity (exclusive of basis swaps) in 2019 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $133 million for net income and $173 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. Based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2019 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $29 million for net income and $37 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 19, 2019, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. The total anticipated 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2019, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2018 levels. In 2019, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.43Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.44ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2018, West Texas Intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $107.95 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per MMBtu to $8.15 per MMBtu. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment. Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility in the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).45Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 7 of this report, specifically the information set forth under the captions ""Derivative Transactions,"" ""Financing,"" ""Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk"" and ""Outlook"" in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.""",2023-12-30 20:18:23.834500
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2020,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations is also an important goal in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized net income of $2,735 million during 2019 as compared to net income of $3,419 million for 2018. At December 31, 2019, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 3,329 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 401 MMBoe from December 31, 2018. During 2019, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 287 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 683 billion cubic feet or 114 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2018.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2019.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.During 2019, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 77% of United States production during both 2019 and 2018. During 2019, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Eagle Ford play, Delaware Basin play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary (NGC), and crude oil and condensate which is sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited. In 2019, EOG drilled and completed two net wells in Trinidad and was in the process of drilling another exploratory well at December 31, 2019. One of these wells was a successful development well, while the other well was determined to be an unsuccessful exploratory well. In addition, EOG drilled one stratigraphic exploratory well in Trinidad, which discovered commercially economic reserves. Other International. In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG drilled two natural gas wells in 2019 to complete the drilling program started in 2018. In 2019, EOG also completed two natural gas wells that were drilled during the 2018 drilling program. All natural gas produced from the Baijaochang Field is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.31Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 19% at December 31, 2019 and 24% at December 31, 2018. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On June 3, 2019, EOG repaid upon maturity the $900 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019.On June 27, 2019, EOG entered into a new $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (New Facility) with domestic and foreign lenders (Banks). The New Facility replaced EOG's $2.0 billion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of July 21, 2015, which had a scheduled maturity date of July 21, 2020. The New Facility has a scheduled maturity date of June 27, 2024, and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods subject to certain terms and conditions. The New Facility (i) commits the Banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion at any one time outstanding, with an option for EOG to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed $3.0 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions, and (ii) includes a swingline subfacility and a letter of credit subfacility.Effective January 1, 2019, EOG adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"" (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments for certain lease transactions and the disclosure of additional leasing information. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs resulted in a significant increase to assets and liabilities related to operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019. Financial results prior to January 1, 2019, are unchanged. See Note 1 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" and Note 18 ""Leases"" to EOG's Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.During 2019, EOG funded $6.7 billion ($152 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $900 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $588 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $25 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of $140 million from the sale of assets.Total anticipated 2020 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges. The majority of 2020 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its New Facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. 32Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Operating Revenues and OtherDuring 2019, operating revenues increased $105 million, or 1%, to $17,380 million from $17,275 million in 2018. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, decreased $365 million, or 3%, to $11,581 million in 2019 from $11,946 million in 2018. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2019 were approximately 90% of total wellhead revenues compared to 89% in 2018. During 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million compared to net losses of $166 million in 2018. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $130 million during 2019, to $5,360 million from $5,230 million in 2018. Net gains on asset dispositions of $124 million in 2019 were primarily as a result of sales of producing properties, acreage and other assets, as well as non-cash property exchanges, in New Mexico compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $175 million in 2018.33Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 455.5 394.8 335.0Trinidad 0.6 0.8 0.9Other International (2) 0.1 4.3 0.8Total 456.2 399.9 336.7Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $57.74 $65.16 $50.91Trinidad 47.16 57.26 42.30Other International (2) 57.40 71.45 57.20Composite 57.72 65.21 50.91Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1) United States 134.1 116.1 88.4Other International (2) — — —Total 134.1 116.1 88.4Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States $16.03 $26.60 $22.61Other International (2) — — —Composite 16.03 26.60 22.61Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1) United States 1,069 923 765Trinidad 260 266 313Other International (2) 37 30 25Total 1,366 1,219 1,103Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States $2.22 $2.88 $2.20Trinidad 2.72 2.94 2.38Other International (2) 4.44 4.08 3.89Composite 2.38 2.92(4)2.29Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (5) United States 767.8 664.7 551.0Trinidad 44.0 45.1 53.0Other International (2) 6.2 9.4 4.9Total 818.0 719.2 608.9 Total MMBoe (5) 298.6 262.5 222.3 (1)Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.

In connection with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, EOG presents natural gas processing fees related to certain processing and marketing agreements as Gathering and Processing Costs, instead of as a deduction to Natural Gas revenues.(5)Thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.342019 compared to 2018. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2019 increased $96 million, or 1%, to $9,613 million from $9,517 million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in production ($1,351 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,255 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2019 decreased 11% to $57.72 per barrel compared to $65.21 per barrel in 2018. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2019 increased 14% to 456 MBbld as compared to 400 MBbld in 2018. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.NGLs revenues in 2019 decreased $343 million, or 30%, to $784 million from $1,127 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead NGLs price ($518 million), partially offset by an increase in production ($175 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price decreased 40% to $16.03 per barrel in 2019 compared to $26.60 per barrel in 2018. NGL production in 2019 increased 16% to 134 MBbld as compared to 116 MBbld in 2018. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2019 decreased $118 million, or 9%, to $1,184 million from $1,302 million in 2018, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($280 million), partially offset by an increase in natural gas deliveries ($162 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 18% to $2.38 per Mcf in 2019 compared to $2.92 per Mcf in 2018. Natural gas deliveries in 2019 increased 12% to 1,366 MMcfd as compared to 1,219 MMcfd in 2018. The increase in production was primarily due to higher deliveries in the United States resulting from increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher natural gas volumes in South Texas. During 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $231 million. During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $259 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2019 decreased $18 million compared to 2018, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities, partially offset by higher margins on natural gas marketing activities.2018 compared to 2017. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2018 increased $3,261 million, or 52%, to $9,517 million from $6,256 million in 2017, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($2,088 million) and an increase in production ($1,173 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2018 increased 28% to $65.21 per barrel compared to $50.91 per barrel in 2017. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2018 increased 19% to 400 MBbld as compared to 337 MBbld in 2017. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.NGLs revenues in 2018 increased $398 million, or 55%, to $1,127 million from $729 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production ($229 million) and a higher composite average wellhead NGLs price ($169 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price increased 18% to $26.60 per barrel in 2018 compared to $22.61 per barrel in 2017. NGLs production in 2018 increased 31% to 116 MBbld as compared to 88 MBbld in 2017. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.35Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2018 increased $380 million, or 41%, to $1,302 million from $922 million in 2017, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($282 million) and an increase in wellhead natural gas deliveries ($98 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 28% to $2.92 per Mcf in 2018 compared to $2.29 per Mcf in 2017. This increase in composite wellhead natural gas prices includes a positive revenue adjustment of $0.44 per Mcf related to the adoption of ASU 2014-09. Natural gas deliveries in 2018 increased 11% to 1,219 MMcfd as compared to 1,103 MMcfd in 2017. The increase in production was primarily due to increased production in the United States (158 MMcfd), partially offset by decreased production in Trinidad (47 MMcfd). The increased production in the United States was due primarily to increased production of associated gas in the Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain area and higher volumes in the Marcellus Shale. The decrease in Trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2017.During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $259 million. During 2017, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $20 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $7 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2018 increased $59 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities.Operating and Other Expenses2019 compared to 2018. During 2019, operating expenses of $13,681 million were $875 million higher than the $12,806 million incurred during 2018. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 Lease and Well$4.58 $4.89Transportation Costs2.54 2.85Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties12.25 12.65Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.31 0.44General and Administrative (G&A)1.64 1.63Net Interest Expense0.62 0.93Total (1)$21.94 $23.39 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 36Lease and well expenses of $1,367 million in 2019 increased $84 million from $1,283 million in 2018 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($76 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($29 million) in the United States, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the United Kingdom ($15 million) due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in Canada ($11 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), the cost of dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $758 million in 2019 increased $11 million from $747 million in 2018 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($91 million) and South Texas ($11 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($77 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($13 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2019 increased $315 million to $3,750 million from $3,435 million in 2018. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2019 were $337 million higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($489 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($119 million) and the sale of the United Kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($33 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $489 million in 2019 increased $62 million from $427 million in 2018 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses ($48 million) and increased information systems costs ($8 million) resulting from expanded operations.Net interest expense of $185 million in 2019 was $60 million lower than 2018 primarily due to repayment of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 in June 2019 ($30 million) and the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in October 2018 ($18 million) and an increase in capitalized interest ($14 million). Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain NGLs fractionation fees paid to third parties. EOG pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract NGLs. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion related to EOG's adoption of ASU 2014-09.Gathering and processing costs increased $42 million to $479 million in 2019 compared to $437 million in 2018 primarily due to increased operating costs and fees in the Permian Basin ($52 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($13 million) and South Texas ($5 million); partially offset by decreased operating costs in the United Kingdom ($33 million) due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.Exploration costs of $140 million in 2019 decreased $9 million from $149 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad ($17 million), partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million).37Impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 2019 2018 Proved properties$207 $121Unproved properties220 173Other assets91 49Inventories— 4Total$518 $347Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2019 and 2018. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2019 increased $28 million to $800 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $772 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) in 2018. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to an increase in ad valorem/property taxes ($53 million), partially offset by an increase in credits available to EOG in 2019 for state incentive severance tax rate reductions ($12 million) and a decrease in severance/production taxes ($12 million) primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, all in the United States.Other income, net, was $31 million in 2019 compared to other income, net, of $17 million in 2018. The increase of $14 million in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest income ($14 million) and an increase in foreign currency transaction gains ($9 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense ($4 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $810 million in 2019 compared to an income tax provision of $822 million in 2018, primarily due to decreased pretax income, partially offset by the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurement-period adjustments. The net effective tax rate for 2019 increased to 23% from 19% in the prior year, primarily due to the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurement-period adjustments.382018 compared to 2017. During 2018, operating expenses of $12,806 million were $875 million higher than the $10,282 million incurred during 2017. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 Lease and Well$4.89 $4.70Transportation Costs2.85 3.33Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Oil and Gas Properties12.65 14.83Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.44 0.51General and Administrative (G&A)1.63 1.95Net Interest Expense0.93 1.23Total (1)$23.39 $26.55 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2018 compared to 2017 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,283 million in 2018 increased $238 million from $1,045 million in 2017 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($171 million), higher workover expenditures ($44 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($41 million), all in the United States, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the United Kingdom ($18 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.Transportation costs of $747 million in 2018 increased $7 million from $740 million in 2017 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($116 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($52 million), the Eagle Ford ($31 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($25 million).DD&A expenses in 2018 increased $26 million to $3,435 million from $3,409 million in 2017. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2018 were $24 million higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($647 million) and the United Kingdom ($21 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($625 million) and a decrease in production in Trinidad ($16 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $427 million in 2018 decreased $7 million from $434 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased professional, legal and other services ($24 million); partially offset by increased employee-related expenses resulting from expanded operations ($15 million) and increased information systems costs ($10 million).Net interest expense of $245 million in 2018 was $29 million lower than 2017 primarily due to repayment of the $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2017 in September 2017 ($25 million) and the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in October 2018 ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($3 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $288 million to $437 million in 2018 compared to $149 million in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 ($204 million) and increased operating costs in the Permian Basin ($32 million), the United Kingdom ($28 million) and the Eagle Ford ($25 million).Exploration costs of $149 million in 2018 increased $4 million from $145 million in 2017 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million), partially offset by decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in Trinidad ($5 million).39The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions): 2018 2017 Proved properties$121 $224Unproved properties173 211Other assets49 28Inventories4 —Total$347 $463Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2018 and 2017. Taxes other than income in 2018 increased $227 million to $772 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) from $545 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) in 2017. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($190 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and an increase in ad valorem/property taxes ($33 million), both in the United States.Other income, net, was $17 million in 2018 compared to other income, net, of $9 million in 2017. The increase of $8 million in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation expense ($12 million) and an increase in interest income ($4 million), partially offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses ($15 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $822 million in 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of $1,921 million in 2017, primarily due to the absence of certain 2017 tax benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and higher pretax income. The most significant impact of the TCJA on EOG was the reduction in the statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% which required the existing net United States federal deferred income tax liability to be remeasured resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit in 2017 of approximately $2.2 billion. The net effective tax rate for 2018 increased to 19% from (291%) in the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the TCJA tax benefits.Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.2019 compared to 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8,163 million in 2019 increased $394 million from $7,769 million in 2018 primarily reflecting an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($490 million), a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($367 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($122 million); partially offset by a decrease in wellhead revenues ($365 million) and an increase in cash operating expenses ($202 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $6,177 million in 2019 increased by $7 million from $6,170 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($313 million), a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets ($87 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($33 million); partially offset by favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($416 million) and a decrease in other investing activities ($10 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $1,513 million in 2019 included repayments of long-term debt ($900 million), cash dividend payments ($588 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($25 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2019 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($18 million). 402018 compared to 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities of $7,769 million in 2018 increased $3,504 million from $4,265 million in 2017 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($4,039 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($758 million) and a favorable change in the cash paid for income taxes ($113 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($746 million) and an unfavorable change in the net cash paid for the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($266 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $6,170 million in 2018 increased by $2,183 million from $3,987 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($1,888 million); unfavorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($211 million); and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($64 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $839 million in 2018 included cash dividend payments ($438 million), repayments of long-term debt ($350 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($63 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2018 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($21 million). Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions): 2019 2018 2017Expenditure Category Capital Exploration and Development Drilling$4,951 $4,935 $3,132Facilities629 625 575Leasehold Acquisitions (1)276 488 427Property Acquisitions (2)380 124 73Capitalized Interest38 24 27Subtotal6,274 6,196 4,234Exploration Costs140 149 145Dry Hole Costs28 5 5Exploration and Development Expenditures6,442 6,350 4,384Asset Retirement Costs186 70 56Total Exploration and Development Expenditures6,628 6,420 4,440Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3)272 286 173Total Expenditures$6,900 $6,706 $4,613 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $98 million, $291 million and $256 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(2)Property acquisitions included $52 million, $71 million and $26 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(3)Other property, plant and equipment included $49 million of non-cash additions in 2018, respectively, primarily related to a finance lease transaction in the Permian Basin.Exploration and development expenditures of $6,442 million for 2019 were $92 million higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased property acquisitions ($256 million), increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in Trinidad ($53 million) and increased capitalized interest ($14 million), partially offset by decreased leasehold acquisitions ($212 million) and decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($19 million) and Other International ($19 million). The 2019 exploration and development expenditures of $6,442 million included $5,513 million in development drilling and facilities, $511 million in exploration, $380 million in property acquisitions and $38 million in capitalized interest. The 2018 exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million included $5,546 million in development drilling and facilities, $656 million million in exploration, $124 million in property acquisitions and $24 million in capitalized interest. The 2017 exploration and development expenditures of $4,384 million included $3,661 million in development drilling and facilities, $623 million in exploration, $73 million in property acquisitions and $27 million in capitalized interest. 41The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.Commodity Derivative TransactionsCrude Oil Derivative Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Midland, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Midland Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Midland Differential basis swap contracts through February 19, 2020.

As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, EOG had outstanding $5,140 million and $6,040 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $5,452 million and $6,027 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.44During 2019, EOG funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program, there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2019 and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. EOG considers the availability of its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (in millions): Contractual Obligations (1) (2) Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 2025 & Beyond Current and Long-Term Debt $5,140 $1,000 $750 $1,250 $2,140Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt 1,059 169 258 193 439Finance Leases (3) 64 15 27 16 6Operating Leases (3) 850 390 335 85 40Leases Effective, Not Commenced (3) 699 80 132 134 353Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (4) 6,034 914 1,632 1,130 2,358Purchase and Service Obligations 1,222 399 498 152 173Total Contractual Obligations $15,068 $2,967 $3,632 $2,960 $5,509 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). These amounts are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.(2)This table does not include the liability for commitments to purchase fixed quantities of crude oil and natural gas. The amounts are excluded because they are variable and based on future commodity prices. At December 31, 2019, EOG is committed to purchase 1.8 MMBbls of crude oil and 5.5 Bcf of natural gas in 2020 and 1.4 MMBls of crude oil in 2021.(3)For more information on contracts that meet the definition of a lease under ASU 2016-02, see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements.(4)Amounts exclude transportation and storage service commitments that meet the definition of a lease. Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2019. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2019, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, China and Canada. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.45Outlook Pricing. Crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2020 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 19, 2020, the average 2020 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $53.75 per barrel and $2.12 per MMBtu, respectively, representing a decrease of 6% for crude oil and a decrease of 20% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2019. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity (exclusive of basis swaps) in 2020 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $117 million for net income and $152 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. Based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2020 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $31 million for net income and $40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 19, 2020, see ""Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. The total anticipated 2020 capital expenditures of approximately $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash exchanges, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2020, both total production and total crude oil production are expected to increase from 2019 levels. In 2020, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.46Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.47ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2019, WTI crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $26.19 per barrel to $77.41 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.49 per MMBtu to $6.24 per MMBtu. Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the production composition of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline and the respective market pricing for each component. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment. Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility in the price of shares of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.48Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 7 of this report, specifically the information set forth under the captions ""Derivative Transactions,"" ""Financing,"" ""Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk"" and ""Outlook"" in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.""",2023-12-30 20:18:01.424402
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2021,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad and China. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Pursuant to this strategy, each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure, coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance, is integral in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized a net loss of $605 million during 2020 as compared to net income of $2,735 million for 2019. At December 31, 2020, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 3,220 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), a decrease of 109 MMBoe from December 31, 2019. During 2020, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves decreased by 108 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 9 billion cubic feet or 1 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2019.Recent Developments Commodity Prices. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world, resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand and prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion. In early March 2020, due to the failure of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia (OPEC+) to reach an agreement on individual crude oil production limits, Saudi Arabia unilaterally reduced the sales price of its crude oil and announced that it would increase its crude oil production. The combination of these actions, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crude oil demand, resulted in significantly lower commodity prices in March and April 2020. In April 2020, the members of OPEC+ reached an agreement to cut crude oil production beginning in May 2020 and extending through April 2022 with the quantity of the production cuts decreasing over time. Subsequent indications of conformity with these agreed-upon production cuts by OPEC+, combined with the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on crude oil demand, have resulted in gradually-improving market conditions. In the second half of 2020, crude oil prices increased, but remain significantly below average prices in 2019, as a result of the continuing rebalancing of crude oil supply resulting from the actions of OPEC+ and the continuing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global demand. In addition, NGL and natural gas prices have recovered to pre-pandemic levels.In response to the commodity price environment in 2020, EOG reduced activity across its operating areas and decreased its total capital expenditures. EOG also elected to reduce crude oil production, by delaying initial production from new wells and shutting-in or otherwise curtailing existing production. In early 2021, the members of OPEC+ met and agreed to taper off certain of their production curtailments (agreed to in April 2020) through March 2021. Subsequent to the meeting, Saudi Arabia announced that it would unilaterally cut its production by an additional one million barrels per day in February 2021 and March 2021. These announcements have had a positive impact on crude oil prices.As a result of the many uncertainties associated with (i) the world economic environment, (ii) the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing effect on the economies and financial markets of the world and (iii) any future actions by the members of OPEC+, and the effect of these uncertainties on worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future. However, prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas have historically been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.EOG will continue to monitor future market conditions and adjust its capital allocation strategy and production outlook accordingly in order to maximize shareholder value while maintaining its strong financial position.332020 Election. In November 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected President of the United States. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled ""Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,"" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to (i) pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and (ii) consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs. In addition, new or revised rules, regulations and policies may be issued, and new legislation may be proposed, during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry. Such rules, regulations, policies and legislation may affect, among other things, (i) permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, (ii) the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development, (iii) the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and/or other climate change-related matters associated with oil and gas operations, (iv) the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, (v) the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and (vi) U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies. See ""Regulation"" in ITEM 1, Business and ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion.EOG will continue to monitor and assess any actions that could impact the oil and gas industry, to determine the impact on its business and operations, and take appropriate actions where necessary.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2020.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.During 2020, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. Such efficiencies, combined with new innovation and decreased service costs, resulted in lower operating, drilling and completion costs in 2020. In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 76% and 77% of United States production during 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Delaware Basin play, Eagle Ford play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico and Texas. In the second quarter of 2020, EOG delayed initial production from most newly-completed wells and shut in some existing production. During the third quarter of 2020, EOG resumed the process of initiating production from completed wells, and the legacy wells that were shut-in were largely brought back on-line. See ITEM 1, Business - Exploration and Production for further discussion.Trinidad. In Trinidad, EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas, which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary, and crude oil and condensate which is sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited. In 2020, EOG drilled three net wells and completed two net wells in Trinidad. The remaining net well made a discovery that is being evaluated.Other International. In the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG continues to work with its partner, PetroChina, under the Production Sharing Contract and other related agreements, to ensure uninterrupted production. All natural gas produced from the Baijaochang Field is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina. In 2020, EOG entered into two agreements related to exploration and production rights in the Sultanate of Oman (Oman). One agreement resulted in EOG acquiring exploration and production rights to Block 36 within Oman. The second agreement was a farm-in agreement allowing EOG to share in exploration and production rights within Block 49. Pursuant to that agreement, EOG participated in the drilling of one gross exploratory well which was in progress as of December 31, 2020.In March 2020, EOG began the process of exiting its Canada operations.34EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 22% at December 31, 2020 and 19% at December 31, 2019. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On April 1, 2020, EOG repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020.On April 14, 2020, EOG closed on its offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% Senior Notes due 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.950% Senior Notes due 2050 (together, the Notes). EOG received net proceeds of $1.48 billion from the issuance of the Notes, which were used to repay the 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 when they matured on June 1, 2020 (see below), and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures.On June 1, 2020, EOG repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020.On February 1, 2021, EOG repaid upon maturity the $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021.During 2020, EOG funded $4.0 billion ($386 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term debt and paid $821 million in dividends to common stockholders, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $1.48 billion from the issuance of the Notes and net proceeds of $192 million from the sale of assets.Total anticipated 2021 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions. The majority of 2021 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. 35Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Operating Revenues and OtherDuring 2020, operating revenues decreased $6,348 million, or 37%, to $11,032 million from $17,380 million in 2019. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, decreased $4,291, or 37%, to $7,290 million in 2020 from $11,581 million in 2019. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2020 were approximately 89% of total wellhead revenues compared to 90% in 2019. During 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million compared to net gains of $180 million in 2019. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased $2,777 million during 2020, to $2,583 million from $5,360 million in 2019. Net losses on asset dispositions of $47 million in 2020 were primarily due to the sales of proved properties and non-cash property exchanges of unproved leasehold in Texas and New Mexico and the disposition of the Marcellus Shale assets compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $124 million in 2019.36Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:Year Ended December 31202020192018Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1)United States408.1 455.5 394.8 Trinidad1.0 0.6 0.8 Other International (2)0.1 0.1 4.3 Total409.2 456.2 399.9 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States$38.65 $57.74 $65.16 Trinidad30.20 47.16 57.26 Other International (2)43.08 57.40 71.45 Composite38.63 57.72 65.21 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1)United States136.0 134.1 116.1 Other International (2)— — — Total136.0 134.1 116.1 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States$13.41 $16.03 $26.60 Other International (2)— — — Composite13.41 16.03 26.60 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1)United States1,040 1,069 923 Trinidad180 260 266 Other International (2)32 37 30 Total1,252 1,366 1,219 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States$1.61 $2.22 $2.88 Trinidad2.57 2.72 2.94 Other International (2)4.66 4.44 4.08 Composite1.83 2.38 2.92 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4)United States717.5 767.8 664.7 Trinidad30.9 44.0 45.1 Other International (2)5.4 6.2 9.4 Total753.8 818.0 719.2 Total MMBoe (4)275.9 298.6 262.5 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.

MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.372020 compared to 2019. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2020 decreased $3,827 million, or 40%, to $5,786 million from $9,613 million in 2019, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($2,860 million) and a decrease in production ($967 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2020 decreased 33% to $38.63 per barrel compared to $57.72 per barrel in 2019. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2020 decreased 10% to 409 MBbld as compared to 456 MBbld in 2019. The decreased production was primarily in the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production in the Permian Basin.NGLs revenues in 2020 decreased $116 million, or 15%, to $668 million from $784 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead NGLs price ($130 million), partially offset by an increase in production ($13 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price decreased 16% to $13.41 per barrel in 2020 compared to $16.03 per barrel in 2019. NGL production in 2020 increased 1% to 136 MBbld as compared to 134 MBbld in 2019. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin, partially offset by decreased production in the Eagle Ford.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2020 decreased $347 million, or 29%, to $837 million from $1,184 million in 2019, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($251 million) and a decrease in natural gas deliveries ($96 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 23% to $1.83 per Mcf in 2020 compared to $2.38 per Mcf in 2019. Natural gas deliveries in 2020 decreased 8% to 1,252 MMcfd as compared to 1,366 MMcfd in 2019. The decrease in production was primarily due to lower natural gas volumes in Trinidad, the Marcellus Shale and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin.During 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil, NGL and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $1,071 million. During 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $231 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2020 decreased $124 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities. The margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and EOG's decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling May and June 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements.2019 compared to 2018. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2019 increased $96 million, or 1%, to $9,613 million from $9,517 million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in production ($1,351 million); partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,255 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2019 decreased 11% to $57.72 per barrel compared to $65.21 per barrel in 2018. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2019 increased 14% to 456 MBbld as compared to 400 MBbld in 2018. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.NGLs revenues in 2019 decreased $343 million, or 30%, to $784 million from $1,127 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead NGLs price ($518 million), partially offset by an increase in production ($175 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price decreased 40% to $16.03 per barrel in 2019 compared to $26.60 per barrel in 2018. NGL production in 2019 increased 16% to 134 MBbld as compared to 116 MBbld in 2018. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2019 decreased $118 million, or 9%, to $1,184 million from $1,302 million in 2018, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($280 million), partially offset by an increase in natural gas deliveries ($162 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 18% to $2.38 per Mcf in 2019 compared to $2.92 per Mcf in 2018. Natural gas deliveries in 2019 increased 12% to 1,366 MMcfd as compared to 1,219 MMcfd in 2018. The increase in production was primarily due to higher deliveries in the United States resulting from increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher natural gas volumes in South Texas. 38During 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $231 million. During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $259 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2019 decreased $18 million compared to 2018, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities, partially offset by higher margins on natural gas marketing activities.Operating and Other Expenses2020 compared to 2019. During 2020, operating expenses of $11,576 million were $2,105 million lower than the $13,681 million incurred during 2019. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: 20202019Lease and Well$3.85 $4.58 Transportation Costs2.66 2.54 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -Oil and Gas Properties11.85 12.25 Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.47 0.31 General and Administrative (G&A)1.75 1.64 Net Interest Expense0.74 0.62 Total (1)$21.32 $21.94 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $1,063 million in 2020 decreased $304 million from $1,367 million in 2019 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($157 million) and in Canada ($25 million), lower workovers expenditures in the United States ($103 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million). Lease and well expenses decreased in the United States primarily due to decreased operating activities resulting from decreased production, efficiency improvements and service cost reductions.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease or an aggregation point on EOG's gathering system to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), the cost of dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.39Transportation costs of $735 million in 2020 decreased $23 million from $758 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($27 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($24 million) and the Eagle Ford ($20 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($56 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2020 decreased $350 million to $3,400 million from $3,750 million in 2019. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2020 were $390 million lower than in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in production in the United States ($222 million) and Trinidad ($22 million) and lower unit rates in the United States ($150 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment in 2020 were $40 million higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in expense related to gathering and storage assets and equipment.G&A expenses of $484 million in 2020 decreased $5 million from $489 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses ($43 million) and professional and other services ($7 million), partially offset by idle equipment and termination fees ($46 million).Net interest expense of $205 million in 2020 was $20 million higher than 2019 primarily due to the issuance of the Notes in April 2020 ($51 million) and lower capitalized interest ($7 million), partially offset by repayment in June 2019 of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 ($21 million), repayment in June 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 ($13 million) and repayment in April 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020 ($10 million).Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain NGLs fractionation fees paid to third parties. EOG pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract NGLs. Gathering and processing costs decreased $20 million to $459 million in 2020 compared to $479 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased operating costs in the Eagle Ford ($16 million) and decreased gathering and processing fees in the Eagle Ford ($9 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($5 million); partially offset by increased gathering and processing fees in the Permian Basin ($15 million).Exploration costs of $146 million in 2020 increased $6 million from $140 million in 2019 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($8 million).Impairments include: amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.40The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 20202019Proved properties$1,268 $207 Unproved properties472 220 Other assets300 91 Firm commitment contracts60 — Total$2,100 $518 Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy and non-core natural gas and crude oil and combo plays in 2020 and legacy natural gas assets in 2019. Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2020 decreased $322 million to $478 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $800 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) in 2019. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes in the United States ($232 million), decreased ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($51 million) and a state severance tax refund ($27 million).Other income, net, was $10 million in 2020 compared to other income, net, of $31 million in 2019. The decrease of $21 million in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income.In response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provides economic support to individuals and businesses through enhanced loan programs, expanded unemployment benefits, and certain payroll and income tax relief, among other provisions. The primary tax benefit of the CARES Act for EOG was the acceleration of approximately $150 million of additional refundable alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits into tax year 2019. These credits originated from AMT paid by EOG in years prior to 2018 and were reflected as a deferred tax asset and a non-current receivable as of December 31, 2019 since they had been expected to either offset future current tax liabilities or be refunded on a declining balance schedule through 2021. The $150 million of additional refundable AMT credits was received in July 2020.Further pandemic relief was contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CA Act) which was signed into law by the President of the United States on December 27, 2020. In addition, the CA Act provided government funding and limited corporate income tax relief primarily related to making permanent or extending certain tax provisions, none of which were a material benefit for EOG.EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $135 million in 2020 compared to an income tax provision of $810 million in 2019, primarily due to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2020 decreased to 18% from 23% in 2019. The lower effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to EOG's foreign operations and increased stock-based compensation tax deficiencies.412019 compared to 2018. During 2019, operating expenses of $13,681 million were $875 million higher than the $12,806 million incurred during 2018. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: 20192018Lease and Well$4.58 $4.89 Transportation Costs2.54 2.85 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -Oil and Gas Properties12.25 12.65 Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.31 0.44 General and Administrative (G&A)1.64 1.63 Net Interest Expense0.62 0.93 Total (1)$21.94 $23.39 (1)Total excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,367 million in 2019 increased $84 million from $1,283 million in 2018 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($76 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($29 million) in the United States, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the United Kingdom ($15 million) due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in Canada ($11 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.Transportation costs of $758 million in 2019 increased $11 million from $747 million in 2018 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($91 million) and South Texas ($11 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($77 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($13 million).DD&A expenses in 2019 increased $315 million to $3,750 million from $3,435 million in 2018. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2019 were $337 million higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($489 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($119 million) and the sale of the United Kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($33 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.G&A expenses of $489 million in 2019 increased $62 million from $427 million in 2018 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses ($48 million) and increased information systems costs ($8 million) resulting from expanded operations.Net interest expense of $185 million in 2019 was $60 million lower than 2018 primarily due to repayment of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 in June 2019 ($30 million) and the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in October 2018 ($18 million) and an increase in capitalized interest ($14 million). Gathering and processing costs increased $42 million to $479 million in 2019 compared to $437 million in 2018 primarily due to increased operating costs and fees in the Permian Basin ($52 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($13 million) and South Texas ($5 million); partially offset by decreased operating costs in the United Kingdom ($33 million) due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.Exploration costs of $140 million in 2019 decreased $9 million from $149 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Trinidad ($17 million), partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million).42The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions): 20192018Proved properties$207 $121 Unproved properties220 173 Other assets91 49 Inventories— 4 Total$518 $347 Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2019 and 2018. Taxes other than income in 2019 increased $28 million to $800 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $772 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) in 2018. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to an increase in ad valorem/property taxes ($53 million), partially offset by an increase in credits available to EOG in 2019 for state incentive severance tax rate reductions ($12 million) and a decrease in severance/production taxes ($12 million) primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, all in the United States.Other income, net, was $31 million in 2019 compared to other income, net, of $17 million in 2018. The increase of $14 million in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest income ($14 million) and an increase in foreign currency transaction gains ($9 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense ($4 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $810 million in 2019 compared to an income tax provision of $822 million in 2018, primarily due to decreased pretax income, partially offset by the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurement-period adjustments. The net effective tax rate for 2019 increased to 23% from 19% in the prior year, primarily due to the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurement-period adjustments.Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders and other property, plant and equipment expenditures.2020 compared to 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities of $5,008 million in 2020 decreased $3,155 million from $8,163 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in wellhead revenues ($4,291 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($166 million); a decrease in gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs ($124 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($86 million); partially offset by an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($840 million) and a decrease in cash operating expenses ($641 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $3,348 million in 2020 decreased by $2,829 million from $6,177 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,908 million); an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets ($52 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($49 million); and a decrease in other investing activities ($10 million); partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital associated with investing activities ($190 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $359 million in 2020 included repayments of long-term debt ($1,000 million), cash dividend payments ($821 million), repayment of finance lease liabilities ($19 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($16 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 included long-term debt borrowings ($1,484 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($16 million). 432019 compared to 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8,163 million in 2019 increased $394 million from $7,769 million in 2018 primarily reflecting an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($490 million), a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($367 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($122 million); partially offset by a decrease in wellhead revenues ($365 million) and an increase in cash operating expenses ($202 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $6,177 million in 2019 increased by $7 million from $6,170 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($313 million), a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets ($87 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($33 million); partially offset by favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($416 million) and a decrease in other investing activities ($10 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $1,513 million in 2019 included repayments of long-term debt ($900 million), cash dividend payments ($588 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($25 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2019 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($18 million).

The decrease was primarily due to decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($2,309 million), decreased facilities expenditures ($282 million) and decreased property acquisitions ($245 million), partially offset by increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in Trinidad ($27 million). The 2020 exploration and development expenditures of $3,601 million included $2,905 million in development drilling and facilities, $530 million in exploration, $135 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. The 2019 exploration and development expenditures of $6,442 million included $5,513 million in development drilling and facilities, $511 million in exploration, $380 million in property acquisitions and $38 million in capitalized interest. The 2018 exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million included $5,546 million in development drilling and facilities, $656 million in exploration, $124 million in property acquisitions and $24 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors. EOG believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.Commodity Derivative TransactionsCrude Oil Derivative Contracts. Prices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent pricing and pricing in Cushing, Oklahoma (ICE Brent Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's ICE Brent Differential basis swap contracts through February 18, 2021.

These contracts offset the remaining Waha Differential basis swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of 50,000 MMBtud at a weighted average price differential of $1.40 per MMBtu. EOG paid net cash of $11.9 million for the settlement of these contracts. The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.FinancingEOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 22% at December 31, 2020, compared to 19% at December 31, 2019. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, EOG had outstanding $5,640 million and $5,140 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,505 million and $5,452 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2020, EOG funded its capital program and operations primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, issuance of the Notes and proceeds from asset sales. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program, there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2020 and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. EOG considers the availability of its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.5051Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 (in millions): Contractual Obligations (1)Total20212022-20232024-20252026 & BeyondCurrent and Long-Term Debt$5,640 $750 $1,250 $500 $3,140 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt2,297 207 366 309 1,415 Finance Leases (2)239 36 60 56 87 Operating Leases (2)1,039 323 344 166 206 Leases Effective, Not Commenced (2)100 14 28 22 36 Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (3)6,665 964 1,830 1,296 2,575 Purchase and Service Obligations1,258 429 497 143 189 Total Contractual Obligations$17,238 $2,723 $4,375 $2,492 $7,648 (1)This table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements). These amounts are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.(2)For more information on contracts that meet the definition of a lease under ASU 2016-02, see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements.(3)Amounts exclude transportation and storage service commitments that meet the definition of a lease. Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2020. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships. Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other ""off-balance sheet arrangement"" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2020, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, China and Canada. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.52Outlook Pricing. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2021 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 18, 2021, the average 2021 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $57.51 per barrel and $2.98 per MMBtu, respectively, representing an increase of 46% for crude oil and an increase of 43% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2020. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.Including the impact of EOG's crude oil and NGL derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2021 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $99 million for net income and $127 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2021 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $31 million for net income and $40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 18, 2021, see ""Commodity Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs. In addition, EOG expects to spend a portion of its anticipated 2021 capital expenditures on leasing acreage and evaluating new prospects. The total anticipated 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2021, total crude oil production is expected to remain at fourth quarter 2020 levels. In 2021, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.53Summary of Critical Accounting PoliciesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration and Development CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves. If commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward or downward, earnings will increase or decrease, respectively.Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.Oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC. The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.Depreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.54Depreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2020, WTI crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $(36.98) per barrel to $77.41 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.33 per MMBtu to $6.24 per MMBtu. Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the components extracted, including ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, among others, and the respective market pricing for each component. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas and the five-year Oil Price Information Services futures strip for NGLs components (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, NGLs prices, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment. Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.Stock-Based CompensationIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility in the price of shares and composition of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.55Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2022,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States and Trinidad. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Pursuant to this strategy, each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure, coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance, is integral in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized net income of $4,664 million during 2021 as compared to a net loss of $605 million for 2020. At December 31, 2021, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 3,747 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 527 MMBoe from December 31, 2020. During 2021, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 50 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 2,862 billion cubic feet or 477 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2020.Recent Developments Commodity Prices. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to address and limit the spread of the virus adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world, resulting in an economic downturn beginning in early 2020 that negatively impacted global demand and prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. In response, OPEC+, a consortium of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and certain non-OPEC global producers (Russia, Kazakhstan and others), agreed to voluntarily curtail crude oil supplies beginning in April 2020 with a schedule to bring back some of these curtailments through April 2021. Certain other non-OPEC+ countries also curtailed production and/or reduced investments in existing and new crude oil projects. This response started the process of balancing supply with demand. In 2021, the effects of global COVID-19 mitigation efforts, including extensive global fiscal stimulus and the availability of vaccines, tempered by new COVID-19 variant strains and corresponding containment measures in certain parts of the world, have resulted in overall increased demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.During 2021 and into early 2022, OPEC+ continued their schedule of gradually returning all curtailed production through 2022 in response to expected increases in demand for crude oil. The continuing rebalancing of crude oil demand and supply resulting from improving or stabilizing conditions in certain economies and financial markets of the world, combined with the continuing actions taken by OPEC+, had a positive impact on crude oil prices in 2021. Prices for crude oil and condensate and NGLs returned to prepandemic levels in the first quarter of 2021, while natural gas prices returned to pre-pandemic levels at the beginning of 2021. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with (i) the world economic and political environment, (ii) the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing effect on the economies and financial markets of the world and (iii) any future actions by the members of OPEC+, and the effect of these uncertainties on worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future. However, prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas have historically been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.EOG will continue to monitor future market conditions and adjust its capital allocation strategy and production outlook accordingly in order to maximize shareholder value while maintaining its strong financial position.34Climate Change. For a discussion of climate change matters and related regulatory matters, including potential developments related to climate change and the potential impacts and risks of such developments on EOG, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and the related discussion in ITEM 1, Business – Regulation. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any climate change-related developments that could impact EOG and the oil and gas industry, to determine the impact on its business and operations, and take appropriate actions where necessary.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2021.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas plays.During 2021, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years. Such efficiencies resulted in lower operating, drilling and completion costs in 2021. In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 75% and 76% of United States production during 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2021, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Delaware Basin play, Eagle Ford oil play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in Texas and New Mexico. EOG faced interruptions to sales in certain markets due to disruptions throughout the United States from Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021. Winter Storm Uri also negatively impacted Lease and Well, Transportation and Gathering and Processing Costs in the first quarter of 2021. See ITEM 1, Business - Exploration and Production for further discussion regarding EOG's 2021 United States operations.Trinidad. In the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad), EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas, which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary, and crude oil and condensate which is sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited (Heritage). In March 2021, EOG signed a farmout agreement with Heritage, which allows EOG to earn a 65% working interest in a portion of the contract area (EOG Area) governed by the Trinidad Northern Area License. The EOG Area is located offshore the southwest coast of Trinidad. EOG continues to make progress on the design and fabrication of a platform and related facilities for its previously announced discovery in the Modified U(a) Block.In 2022, EOG expects to drill one net exploratory well in the EOG Area in addition to three development wells and one exploratory well in the Modified U(a) Block. Other International. In Australia, on April 22, 2021, a subsidiary of EOG entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the WA-488-P Block, located offshore Western Australia. The transaction was closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 including the transfer of the petroleum exploration permit for that block. In 2022, EOG will continue preparing for the drilling of an exploration well which is expected to commence in 2023.In the Sultanate of Oman (Oman), a Royal Decree was issued on March 9, 2021, and EOG became a participant in the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement for Block 49, holding a 50% working interest. EOG's partner in Block 49 completed the drilling and testing of one net exploratory well, which was determined to be a dry hole. EOG notified its partner and the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of its intention to withdraw from Block 49. In Block 36, where EOG holds a 100% working interest, EOG drilled two net exploratory wells and completed one net exploratory well. There was a discovery of natural gas in Block 36, but the well results did not yield sufficient projected returns for EOG to move forward with the project. EOG recorded pretax impairment charges of $45 million and dry hole costs of $42 million in 2021. In 2022, EOG expects to exit Block 36.In May 2021, EOG closed the sale of its subsidiary which held all of its assets in the China Sichuan Basin (China). Net production was approximately 25 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of natural gas prior to the sale. EOG no longer has any operations or assets in China.35EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 19% at December 31, 2021 and 22% at December 31, 2020. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. On February 1, 2021, EOG repaid upon maturity the $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 (2021 Notes).During 2021, EOG funded $4.1 billion ($124 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), paid $2,684 million in dividends to common stockholders and repaid the 2021 Notes, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities and net proceeds of $231 million from the sale of assets.Total anticipated 2022 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions. The majority of 2022 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Dividend Declarations and Share Repurchase Authorization. On February 25, 2021, EOG's Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $0.375 per share to $0.4125 per share, effective beginning with the dividend paid on April 30, 2021, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2021. On May 6, 2021, EOG's Board declared a special cash dividend on the common stock of $1.00 per share. The special cash dividend, which was in addition to the quarterly cash dividend, was paid on July 30, 2021 to stockholders of record as of July 16, 2021.On November 4, 2021, EOG's Board (i) further increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $0.4125 per share to $0.75 per share, effective beginning with the dividend paid on January 28, 2022, to stockholders of record as of January 14, 2022, (ii) declared a special cash dividend on the common stock of $2.00 per share, paid on December 30, 2021, to stockholders of record as of December 15, 2021, (iii) established a new share repurchase authorization to allow for the repurchase by EOG of up to $5 billion of the common stock and (iv) revoked and terminated the share repurchase authorization established by the Board in September 2001. See ITEM 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional discussion.On February 24, 2022, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on the common stock of $0.75 per share payable April 29, 2022, to stockholders of record as of April 15, 2022. The Board also declared a special dividend of $1.00 per share payable March 29, 2022, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2022.36Results of OperationsThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.Operating Revenues and OtherDuring 2021, operating revenues increased $7,610 million, or 69%, to $18,642 million from $11,032 million in 2020. Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $8,090 million, or 111%, to $15,381 million in 2021 from $7,291 million in 2020. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2021 were approximately 84% of total wellhead revenues compared to 89% in 2020. During 2021, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,152 million compared to net gains of $1,145 million in 2020. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $1,705 million during 2021, to $4,288 million from $2,583 million in 2020. EOG recognized net gains on asset dispositions of $17 million in 2021 compared to net losses on asset dispositions of $47 million in 2020.37Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:Year Ended December 31202120202019Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1)United States443.4 408.1 455.5 Trinidad1.5 1.0 0.6 Other International (2)0.1 0.1 0.1 Total445.0 409.2 456.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States$68.54 $38.65 $57.74 Trinidad56.26 30.20 47.16 Other International (2)42.36 43.08 57.40 Composite68.50 38.63 57.72 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1)United States144.5 136.0 134.1 Other International (2)— — — Total144.5 136.0 134.1 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States$34.35 $13.41 $16.03 Other International (2)— — — Composite34.35 13.41 16.03 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1)United States1,210 1,040 1,069 Trinidad217 180 260 Other International (2)9 32 37 Total1,436 1,252 1,366 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States$4.88 $1.61 $2.22 Trinidad3.40 2.57 2.72 Other International (2)5.67 4.66 4.44 Composite4.66 1.83 2.38 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4)United States789.6 717.5 767.8 Trinidad37.7 30.9 44.0 Other International (2)1.6 5.4 6.2 Total828.9 753.8 818.0 Total MMBoe (4)302.5 275.9 298.6 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's China and Canada operations.

Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas. MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.382021 compared to 2020. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2021 increased $5,339 million, or 92%, to $11,125 million from $5,786 million in 2020, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,852 million) and an increase in production ($487 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2021 increased 77% to $68.50 per barrel compared to $38.63 per barrel in 2020. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2021 increased 9% to 445 MBbld as compared to 409 MBbld in 2020. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin, partially offset by decreased production in the Eagle Ford oil play.NGLs revenues in 2021 increased $1,144 million, or 171%, to $1,812 million from $668 million in 2020 primarily due to a higher composite average wellhead NGLs price ($1,104 million) and an increase in production ($40 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price increased 156% to $34.35 per barrel in 2021 compared to $13.41 per barrel in 2020. NGL production in 2021 increased 6% to 145 MBbld as compared to 136 MBbld in 2020. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2021 increased $1,607 million, or 192%, to $2,444 million from $837 million in 2020, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($1,486 million) and an increase in natural gas deliveries ($121 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 155% to $4.66 per Mcf in 2021 compared to $1.83 per Mcf in 2020. Natural gas deliveries in 2021 increased 15% to 1,436 MMcfd as compared to 1,252 MMcfd in 2020. The increase in production was primarily due to increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher natural gas volumes in Trinidad, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes associated with the dispositions of the Marcellus Shale assets in the third quarter of 2020 and the China assets in the second quarter of 2021.During 2021, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,152 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil, NGL and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $638 million. During 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil, NGL and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $1,071 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm capacity at third-party facilities with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2021 increased $230 million compared to 2020, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate and natural gas marketing activities. The margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and EOG's decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling May and June 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements.2020 compared to 2019. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2020 decreased $3,827 million, or 40%, to $5,786 million from $9,613 million in 2019, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($2,860 million) and a decrease in production ($967 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2020 decreased 33% to $38.63 per barrel compared to $57.72 per barrel in 2019. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2020 decreased 10% to 409 MBbld as compared to 456 MBbld in 2019. The decreased production was primarily in the Eagle Ford oil play and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production in the Permian Basin.NGLs revenues in 2020 decreased $116 million, or 15%, to $668 million from $784 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead NGLs price ($130 million), partially offset by an increase in production ($13 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price decreased 16% to $13.41 per barrel in 2020 compared to $16.03 per barrel in 2019. NGL production in 2020 increased 1% to 136 MBbld as compared to 134 MBbld in 2019. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin, partially offset by decreased production of associated NGLs in the Eagle Ford oil play.39Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2020 decreased $347 million, or 29%, to $837 million from $1,184 million in 2019, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($251 million) and a decrease in natural gas deliveries ($96 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 23% to $1.83 per Mcf in 2020 compared to $2.38 per Mcf in 2019. Natural gas deliveries in 2020 decreased 8% to 1,252 MMcfd as compared to 1,366 MMcfd in 2019. The decrease in production was primarily due to lower natural gas volumes in Trinidad, the Marcellus Shale and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin.During 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil, NGL and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $1,071 million. During 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $231 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2020 decreased $124 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities. The margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and EOG's decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling May and June 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements.Operating and Other Expenses2021 compared to 2020. During 2021, operating expenses of $12,540 million were $964 million higher than the $11,576 million incurred during 2020. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: 20212020Lease and Well$3.75 $3.85 Transportation Costs2.85 2.66 Gathering and Processing Costs1.85 1.66Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -Oil and Gas Properties11.58 11.85 Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.49 0.47 General and Administrative (G&A)1.69 1.75 Net Interest Expense0.59 0.74 Total (1)$22.80 $22.98 (1)Total excludes exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, gathering and processing costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2021 compared to 2020 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. 40Lease and well expenses of $1,135 million in 2021 increased $72 million from $1,063 million in 2020 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($33 million) and in Trinidad ($5 million), higher workovers expenditures in the United States ($25 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million); partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in Canada ($6 million) and as a result of the disposition of all of the China assets in the second quarter of 2021 ($5 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting from increased production.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease or an aggregation point on EOG's gathering system to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, storage and terminal fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), the cost of dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $863 million in 2021 increased $128 million from $735 million in 2020 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($121 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($22 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford oil play ($13 million).Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain NGLs fractionation fees paid to third parties. EOG pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract NGLs.Gathering and processing costs increased $100 million to $559 million in 2021 compared to $459 million in 2020 primarily due to increased gathering and processing fees related to production from the Permian Basin ($51 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($10 million), increased operating costs in the Permian Basin ($26 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($7 million) and increased administrative expenses in the United States ($15 million); partially offset by decreased gathering and processing fees in the Eagle Ford oil play ($5 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2021 increased $251 million to $3,651 million from $3,400 million in 2020. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2021 were $235 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($307 million) and Trinidad ($12 million) and higher unit rates in Trinidad ($14 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($85 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment in 2021 were $15 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in expense related to storage assets.G&A expenses of $511 million in 2021 increased $27 million from $484 million in 2020 primarily due to a net increase in costs associated with corporate support activities, including employee-related expenses and increased information system costs ($54 million); partially offset by a decrease in idle equipment and termination fees ($46 million).Net interest expense of $178 million in 2021 was $27 million lower than 2020 primarily due to repayment in February 2021 of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 ($29 million), repayment in June 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 ($9 million), repayment in April 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020 ($3 million) and lower interest payments for late royalty payments on Oklahoma properties ($6 million), partially offset by the issuance in April 2020 of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due 2050 ($11 million) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2030 ($10 million).Exploration costs of $154 million in 2021 increased $8 million from $146 million in 2020 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States.41Impairments include: amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions): 20212020Proved properties$20 $1,268 Unproved properties310 472 Other assets28 300 Inventories13 — Firm commitment contracts5 60 Total$376 $2,100 Impairments of proved properties in 2020 were primarily due to the decline in commodity prices and were primarily related to the write-down to fair value of legacy and non-core natural gas, crude oil and combo plays in the United States. Impairments of unproved oil and gas properties included charges of $38 million in 2021 due to the decision in the fourth quarter of 2021 to exit Block 36 and Block 49 in Oman and $252 million in 2020 for certain leasehold costs that are no longer expected to be developed before expiration. Impairments of other assets in 2020 were primarily for the write-down to fair value of sand and crude-by-rail assets and a commodity price-related write-down of other assets. Impairments of firm commitment contracts in 2020 were a result of the decision to exit the Horn River Basin in Canada.Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2021 increased $569 million to $1,047 million (6.8% of wellhead revenues) from $478 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2020. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the United States ($522 million), increased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($7 million) and decreased state severance tax refunds ($39 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $1,269 million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $134 million in 2020, primarily due to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2021 increased to 21% from 18% in 2020. The higher effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to EOG's foreign operations and stock-based compensation tax deficiencies increasing the effective tax rate on pretax income in 2021 and decreasing the effective tax rate on pretax loss in 2020.422020 compared to 2019. During 2020, operating expenses of $11,576 million were $2,105 million lower than the $13,681 million incurred during 2019. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: 20202019Lease and Well$3.85 $4.58 Transportation Costs2.66 2.54 Gathering and Processing Costs1.66 1.60 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -Oil and Gas Properties11.85 12.25 Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.47 0.31 General and Administrative (G&A)1.75 1.64 Net Interest Expense0.74 0.62 Total (1)$22.98 $23.54 (1)Total excludes exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, gathering and processing costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,063 million in 2020 decreased $304 million from $1,367 million in 2019 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($157 million) and in Canada ($25 million), lower workovers expenditures in the United States ($103 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million). Lease and well expenses decreased in the United States primarily due to decreased operating activities resulting from decreased production, efficiency improvements and service cost reductions.Transportation costs of $735 million in 2020 decreased $23 million from $758 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($27 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($24 million) and the Eagle Ford oil play ($20 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($56 million).Gathering and processing costs decreased $20 million to $459 million in 2020 compared to $479 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased operating costs in the Eagle Ford ($16 million) and decreased gathering and processing fees in the Eagle Ford oil play ($9 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($5 million); partially offset by increased gathering and processing fees in the Permian Basin ($15 million).DD&A expenses in 2020 decreased $350 million to $3,400 million from $3,750 million in 2019. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2020 were $390 million lower than in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in production in the United States ($222 million) and Trinidad ($22 million) and lower unit rates in the United States ($150 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment in 2020 were $40 million higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in expense related to gathering and storage assets and equipment.G&A expenses of $484 million in 2020 decreased $5 million from $489 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses ($43 million) and professional and other services ($7 million), partially offset by idle equipment and termination fees ($46 million).Net interest expense of $205 million in 2020 was $20 million higher than 2019 primarily due to the issuance of the Notes in April 2020 ($51 million) and lower capitalized interest ($7 million), partially offset by repayment in June 2019 of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 ($21 million), repayment in June 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 ($13 million) and repayment in April 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020 ($10 million).43Exploration costs of $146 million in 2020 increased $6 million from $140 million in 2019 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($8 million).The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 20202019Proved properties$1,268 $207 Unproved properties472 220 Other assets300 91 Firm commitment contracts60 — Total$2,100 $518 Impairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy and non-core natural gas and crude oil and combo plays in 2020 and legacy natural gas assets in 2019. Taxes other than income in 2020 decreased $322 million to $478 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $800 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) in 2019. The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes in the United States ($232 million), decreased ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($51 million) and a state severance tax refund ($27 million).Other income, net, was $10 million in 2020 compared to other income, net, of $31 million in 2019. The decrease of $21 million in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income.In response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provides economic support to individuals and businesses through enhanced loan programs, expanded unemployment benefits, and certain payroll and income tax relief, among other provisions. The primary tax benefit of the CARES Act for EOG was the acceleration of approximately $150 million of additional refundable alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits into tax year 2019. These credits originated from AMT paid by EOG in years prior to 2018 and were reflected as a deferred tax asset and a non-current receivable as of December 31, 2019 since they had been expected to either offset future current tax liabilities or be refunded on a declining balance schedule through 2021. The $150 million of additional refundable AMT credits was received in July 2020.Further pandemic relief was contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CA Act) which was signed into law by the President of the United States on December 27, 2020. In addition, the CA Act provided government funding and limited corporate income tax relief primarily related to making permanent or extending certain tax provisions, none of which were a material benefit for EOG.EOG recognized an income tax benefit of $134 million in 2020 compared to an income tax provision of $810 million in 2019, primarily due to decreased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2020 decreased to 18% from 23% in 2019. The lower effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to EOG's foreign operations and increased stock-based compensation tax deficiencies.44Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; repayments of debt; net cash paid for settlements of commodity derivative contracts and other property, plant and equipment expenditures.2021 compared to 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8,791 million in 2021 increased $3,783 million from $5,008 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in wellhead revenues ($8,090 million) and an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs ($230 million); partially offset by an increase in net cash paid for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($1,709 million); an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($1,320 million); net cash used in working capital in 2021 ($817 million) compared to net cash provided by working capital in 2020 ($193 million); and an increase in cash operating expenses ($882 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $3,419 million in 2021 increased by $71 million from $3,348 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($394 million), partially offset by net cash provided by working capital associated with investing activities in 2021 ($200 million) compared to net cash used in working capital associated with investing activities in 2020 ($75 million); an increase in proceeds from the sales of assets ($39 million); and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($9 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $3,493 million in 2021 included cash dividend payments ($2,684 million), repayments of long-term debt ($750 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($41 million) and repayment of finance lease liabilities ($37 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2021 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($19 million). 2020 compared to 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities of $5,008 million in 2020 decreased $3,155 million from $8,163 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in wellhead revenues ($4,291 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($166 million); a decrease in gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs ($123 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($86 million); partially offset by an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($840 million) and a decrease in cash operating expenses ($641 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $3,348 million in 2020 decreased by $2,829 million from $6,177 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,908 million); an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets ($52 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($49 million); and a decrease in other investing activities ($10 million); partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital associated with investing activities ($190 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $359 million in 2020 included repayments of long-term debt ($1,000 million), cash dividend payments ($821 million), repayment of finance lease liabilities ($19 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($16 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 included long-term debt borrowings ($1,484 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($16 million). 45Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions): 202120202019Expenditure CategoryCapitalExploration and Development Drilling$2,864 $2,664 $4,951 Facilities405 347 629 Leasehold Acquisitions (1)215 265 276 Property Acquisitions (2)100 135 380 Capitalized Interest33 31 38 Subtotal3,617 3,442 6,274 Exploration Costs154 146 140 Dry Hole Costs71 13 28 Exploration and Development Expenditures3,842 3,601 6,442 Asset Retirement Costs127 117 186 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures3,969 3,718 6,628 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3)286 395 272 Total Expenditures$4,255 $4,113 $6,900 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $45 million, $197 million and $98 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(2)Property acquisitions included $5 million, $15 million and $52 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.(3)Other property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $74 million and $174 million, primarily related to finance lease transactions for storage facilities in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Exploration and development expenditures of $3,842 million for 2021 were $241 million higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($267 million) and increased facilities expenditures ($58 million), partially offset by decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in Trinidad ($61 million), decreased leasehold acquisitions ($50 million) and decreased property acquisitions ($35 million). The 2021 exploration and development expenditures of $3,842 million included $3,172 million in development drilling and facilities, $537 million in exploration, $100 million in property acquisitions and $33 million in capitalized interest. The 2020 exploration and development expenditures of $3,601 million included $2,905 million in development drilling and facilities, $530 million in exploration, $135 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. The 2019 exploration and development expenditures of $6,442 million included $5,513 million in development drilling and facilities, $511 million in exploration, $380 million in property acquisitions and $38 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors. EOG believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.46Commodity Derivative TransactionsPresented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts settled during the year ended December 31, 2021 (closed) and remaining for 2022 and thereafter, as of February 18, 2022.

EOG expects this collateral to be applied to the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts if market prices remain above contract prices or returned to EOG if market prices decrease below contract prices.FinancingEOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 19% at December 31, 2021, compared to 22% at December 31, 2020. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, EOG had outstanding $4,890 million and $5,640 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $5,577 million and $6,505 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2021, EOG funded its capital program and operations primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program, there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2021 and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. EOG considers the availability of its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2021, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, Australia, Oman, Canada and, through May 2021, in China. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.Outlook Pricing. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world economic and political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, the availabilities of other energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2022 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 18, 2022, the average 2022 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $84.45 per barrel and $4.61 per MMBtu, respectively, representing an increase of 24% for crude oil and an increase of 20% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2021. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for additional discussion of the impact of commodity prices (including fluctuations in commodity prices) on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Including the impact of EOG's crude oil and NGL derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2022 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $107 million for net income and $138 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2022 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $15 million for net income and $19 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 18, 2022, see ""Commodity Derivative Transactions"" above.49Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States drilling activity in its Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford oil play, Rocky Mountain area and Dorado gas play where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and offset inflationary pressure through efficiency gains and by locking in certain service costs for drilling and completion activities. In addition, EOG expects to spend a portion of its anticipated 2022 capital expenditures on leasing acreage, evaluating new prospects, long-term transportation infrastructure and environmental projects. The total anticipated 2022 capital expenditures of approximately $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2022, total crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production is expected to return to prepandemic levels. In 2022, EOG expects to continue to focus on mitigating inflationary pressure on operating costs through efficiency improvements.Cash Requirements. Certain of EOG's capital expenditures and operating expenses are subject to contracts with minimum commitments, including those that meet the definition of a lease under ASU 2016-02. In 2022, EOG anticipates the following cash requirements under these commitments (in millions):Finance Leases (1)$42 Operating Leases (1)262Leases Effective, Not Commenced (1)25Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) (3)961Purchase and Service Obligations (3)374Total Cash Requirements$1,664 (1) For more information on contracts that meet the definition of a lease under ASU 2016-02, see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Amounts exclude transportation and storage service commitments that meet the definition of a lease. Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2021. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(3) For more information on transportation and storage service commitments and purchase and service obligations, see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2022, EOG has no senior notes maturing and expects to pay interest of $191 million on senior notes. For more information on EOG's current and long-term debt, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash requirements to settle the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7, and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements) are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.EOG expects to fund its exploration, development and exploitation activities and other cash requirements, both in 2022 and in future years, primarily from internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. As discussed above, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.50Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies and estimates as critical based on, among other things, their impact on EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies and estimates cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies and estimates. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies and estimates:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration and Development CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves. If commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The concept of sufficient progress is subject to significant judgment and may require further operational actions or require additional approvals from government agencies or partners in oil and gas operations, among other factors, the timing of which may delay management's determinations. See Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward or downward, earnings will increase or decrease, respectively.51Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2021, WTI crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $(36.98) per barrel to $85.64 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.33 per MMBtu to $23.86 per MMBtu. Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the components extracted, including ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, among others, and the respective market pricing for each component. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas and the five-year Oil Price Information Services futures strip for NGLs components (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, NGLs prices, natural gas prices or estimated proved reserves diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary.See Notes 13 and 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosures of impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment. Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.52Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 7 of this report, specifically the information set forth under the captions ""Commodity Derivative Transactions,"" ""Financing,"" ""Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk"" and ""Outlook"" in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity.""",2023-12-30 20:17:40.217415
821189,EOG,EOG RESOURCES INC,2023,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States and Trinidad. EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. Pursuant to this strategy, each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return. This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to maximize long-term shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet. EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves. Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure, coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance, is integral in the implementation of EOG's strategy.EOG realized net income of $7,759 million during 2022 as compared to net income of $4,664 million for 2021. At December 31, 2022, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 4,238 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), an increase of 491 MMBoe from December 31, 2021. During 2022, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves increased by 429 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves increased by 369 billion cubic feet or 62 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2021.Recent Developments Commodity Prices. Prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas have historically been volatile. This volatility is expected to continue due to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment and the global supply of, and demand for, crude oil, NGLs and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies, the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors. The market prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which, in turn, impact EOG's financial position and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the average U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) crude oil and natural gas prices were $94.23 per barrel and $6.64 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), respectively, representing increases of 39% and 72%, respectively, from the average NYMEX prices for the year ended December 31, 2021. Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the components extracted, including ethane, propane and butane and natural gasoline, among others, and the respective market pricing for each component. The increases in crude oil and natural gas prices during 2022 were due to numerous factors, including the continued recovery in demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; low worldwide inventory levels; continued supply restraint by OPEC+ (a consortium of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and certain non-OPEC global producers); and the impact resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Inflation Considerations; Availability of Materials, Labor & Services. Beginning in the second half of 2021 and continuing throughout 2022, EOG, similar to other companies in its industry, has experienced inflationary pressures on its operating and capital costs - namely the costs of fuel, steel (i.e., wellbore tubulars and facilities manufactured using steel), labor and drilling and completion services. Such inflationary pressures have resulted from (i) supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limited availability of certain materials and products manufactured using such materials; (ii) increased demand for fuel and steel; (iii) increased demand for drilling and completion services coupled with a limited number of available service providers, resulting in increased competition for such services among EOG and other companies in its industry; (iv) labor shortages; and (v) other factors, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and the Ukraine which began in late February 2022.33Such inflationary pressures on EOG's operating and capital costs have, in turn, impacted its cash flows and results of operations. However, by virtue of its continued focus on increasing its drilling, completion and operating efficiencies and improving the performance of its wells, as well as the flexibility provided by its multi-basin drilling portfolio, EOG has been able to largely offset such impacts. EOG currently expects such inflationary pressures to result in an increase of approximately 10 percent in its fiscal year 2023 well costs (i.e., its costs for drilling, completions and well-site facilities) versus fiscal year 2022. Accordingly, such expected increase in EOG's fiscal year 2023 well costs is not expected to have a material impact on EOG's full-year 2023 results of operations. Further, such inflationary pressures and the factors contributing to such inflationary pressures (described above) are not expected to impact EOG's liquidity, capital resources, cash requirements or financial position or its ability to conduct its day-to-day drilling, completion and production operations.The initiatives EOG has undertaken (and continues to undertake) to increase its drilling, completion and operating efficiencies and improve the performance of its wells and, in turn, partially mitigate such inflationary pressures, include (among others): (i) EOG's downhole drilling motor program, which has resulted in increased footage drilled per day and, in turn, reduced drilling times; (ii) enhanced techniques for completing its wells, which has resulted in increased footage completed per day and pumping hours per day; and (iii) EOG's self-sourced sand program, which has resulted in continued costs savings for the sand utilized in its well completion operations. In addition, EOG enters into agreements with its service providers from time to time, when available and advantageous, to secure the costs and availability of certain of the drilling and completion services it utilizes as part of its operations.EOG plans to continue with these initiatives and actions, though there can be no assurance that such efforts will offset, largely or at all, the impacts of any future inflationary pressures on EOG's operating and capital costs, cash flows and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that the factors contributing to any future inflationary pressures will not impact EOG's ability to conduct its future day-to-day drilling, completion and production operations. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, for related discussion.Climate Change. For a discussion of climate change matters and related regulatory matters, including potential developments related to climate change and the potential impacts and risks of such developments on EOG, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and the related discussion in ITEM 1, Business – Regulation. EOG will continue to monitor and assess any climate change-related developments that could impact EOG and the oil and gas industry, to determine the impact on its business and operations, and take appropriate actions where necessary.OperationsSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2022.United States. EOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful. EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production. EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and natural gas plays.In 2022, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies, to improve well performance and, as is further discussed above, to partially mitigate inflationary pressures on its operating and capital costs. In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical or bolt-on acquisitions. On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 75% of EOG's United States production during both 2022 and 2021. During 2022, EOG's drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Delaware Basin play, Eagle Ford play and Rocky Mountain area. EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico and Texas. See ITEM 1, Business - Exploration and Production for further discussion regarding EOG's 2022 United States operations.34Trinidad. In the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad), EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary (NGC), and crude oil and condensate which is sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited (Heritage), with the exception of the Modified U(b) Block in which the company ceased to have an interest in the production of natural gas and crude oil and condensate in the fourth quarter of 2022. In July 2022, EOG amended the natural gas sales contract with NGC to extend the term and provide for an increase in price realizations if index prices for certain commodities exceed specified levels. The pricing component of this amendment was effective September 2020.In March 2021, EOG signed a farmout agreement with Heritage, which allows EOG to earn a 65% working interest in a portion of the contract area (EOG Area) governed by the Trinidad Northern Area License. The EOG Area is located offshore the southwest coast of Trinidad. In 2022, EOG drilled one net exploratory well, which was determined to be unsuccessful.Also in 2022, EOG completed the design, fabrication and installation of a platform and related facilities for its previously announced discovery in the Modified U(a) Block. Additionally in 2022, EOG completed the drilling of, and put on production, two net exploratory wells from a pre-existing platform in the Modified U(a) Block. In 2023, EOG expects to complete three developmental and two exploratory wells in the Modified U(a) Block. Additionally, EOG expects to make progress on the design and construction of a platform and related facilities in the Mento Area.Other International. In November 2021, a subsidiary of EOG was granted an exploration permit for the WA-488-P Block, located offshore Western Australia. In 2022, EOG continued preparing for the drilling of an exploration well, the timing of which will depend on obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequent equipment availability.EOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.Capital StructureOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group. EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 17% at December 31, 2022 and 19% at December 31, 2021. As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. During 2022, EOG funded $5.3 billion ($153 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations) and paid $5.1 billion in dividends to common stockholders, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities.Total anticipated 2023 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion, excluding acquisitions, non-cash transactions and exploration costs. The majority of 2023 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.Management continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history. When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. Cash Return Framework. On May 5, 2022, EOG announced the addition of quantitative guidance to its cash return framework - specifically, a commitment to return a minimum of 60% of annual net cash provided by operating activities before certain balance sheet-related changes, less total capital expenditures, to stockholders, through a combination of quarterly dividends, special dividends and share repurchases. For related discussion regarding our payment of dividends, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ITEM 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, of EOG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed on February 23, 2023 (EOG's 2022 Annual Report).35Dividend Declarations.

Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, increased $7,415 million, or 48%, to $22,796 million in 2022 from $15,381 million in 2021. Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2022 were approximately 83% of total wellhead revenues compared to 84% in 2021. During 2022, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $3,982 million compared to net losses of $1,152 million in 2021. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues increased $2,408 million during 2022, to $6,696 million from $4,288 million in 2021. EOG recognized net gains on asset dispositions of $74 million in 2022 compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $17 million in 2021.36Wellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:Year Ended December 31202220212020Crude Oil and Condensate Volumes (MBbld) (1)United States460.7 443.4 408.1 Trinidad0.6 1.5 1.0 Other International (2)— 0.1 0.1 Total461.3 445.0 409.2 Average Crude Oil and Condensate Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States$97.22 $68.54 $38.65 Trinidad86.16 56.26 30.20 Other International (2)— 42.36 43.08 Composite97.21 68.50 38.63 Natural Gas Liquids Volumes (MBbld) (1)United States197.7 144.5 136.0 Other International (2)— — — Total197.7 144.5 136.0 Average Natural Gas Liquids Prices ($/Bbl) (3) United States$36.70 $34.35 $13.41 Other International (2)— — — Composite36.70 34.35 13.41 Natural Gas Volumes (MMcfd) (1)United States1,315 1,210 1,040 Trinidad180 217 180 Other International (2)— 9 32 Total1,495 1,436 1,252 Average Natural Gas Prices ($/Mcf) (3) United States$7.27 $4.88 $1.61 Trinidad4.43 (5)3.40 2.57 Other International (2)— 5.67 4.66 Composite6.93 4.66 1.83 Crude Oil Equivalent Volumes (MBoed) (4)United States877.5 789.6 717.5 Trinidad30.7 37.7 30.9 Other International (2)— 1.6 5.4 Total908.2 828.9 753.8 Total MMBoe (4)331.5 302.5 275.9 (1) Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.(2)Other International includes EOG's China and Canada operations.

MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.(5)Includes positive revenue adjustment of $0.76 per Mcf ($0.09 per Mcf of EOG's composite wellhead natural gas price) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, related to a price adjustment per a provision of the natural gas sales contact with NGC amended in July 2022 for natural gas sales during the period from September 2020 through June 2022.372022 compared to 2021. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2022 increased $5,242 million, or 47%, to $16,367 million from $11,125 million in 2021, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,831 million) and an increase in production ($411 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2022 increased 42% to $97.21 per barrel compared to $68.50 per barrel in 2021. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2022 increased 4% to 461 MBbld as compared to 445 MBbld in 2021. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin, partially offset by decreased production in the Eagle Ford play and the Rocky Mountain area.NGLs revenues in 2022 increased $836 million, or 46%, to $2,648 million from $1,812 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in production ($666 million) and a higher composite average wellhead NGLs price ($170 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price increased 7% to $36.70 per barrel in 2022 compared to $34.35 per barrel in 2021. NGLs production in 2022 increased 37% to 198 MBbld as compared to 145 MBbld in 2021. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin.Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2022 increased $1,337 million, or 55%, to $3,781 million from $2,444 million in 2021, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($1,234 million) and an increase in natural gas deliveries ($103 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 49% to $6.93 per Mcf in 2022 compared to $4.66 per Mcf in 2021. Natural gas deliveries in 2022 increased 4% to 1,495 MMcfd as compared to 1,436 MMcfd in 2021. The increase in production was primarily due to increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher deliveries in the Dorado gas play, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes due to the sale of certain legacy natural gas assets in the Rocky Mountain area in the first quarter of 2022, lower natural gas volumes in Trinidad and decreased production of associated natural gas from the Eagle Ford play.During 2022, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $3,982 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $3,501 million. During 2021, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,152 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $638 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand. Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm capacity at third-party facilities with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities. EOG sells sand primarily in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations. Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2022 increased $46 million compared to 2021, primarily due to higher margins on natural gas marketing activities, partially offset by lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities. 2021 compared to 2020. Wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2021 increased $5,339 million, or 92%, to $11,125 million from $5,786 million in 2020, due primarily to a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($4,852 million) and an increase in production ($487 million). EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2021 increased 77% to $68.50 per barrel compared to $38.63 per barrel in 2020. Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2021 increased 9% to 445 MBbld as compared to 409 MBbld in 2020. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin, partially offset by decreased production in the Eagle Ford play.NGLs revenues in 2021 increased $1,144 million, or 171%, to $1,812 million from $668 million in 2020 primarily due to a higher composite average wellhead NGLs price ($1,104 million) and an increase in production ($40 million). EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price increased 156% to $34.35 per barrel in 2021 compared to $13.41 per barrel in 2020. NGLs production in 2021 increased 6% to 145 MBbld as compared to 136 MBbld in 2020. The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin.38Wellhead natural gas revenues in 2021 increased $1,607 million, or 192%, to $2,444 million from $837 million in 2020, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price ($1,486 million) and an increase in natural gas deliveries ($121 million). EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 155% to $4.66 per Mcf in 2021 compared to $1.83 per Mcf in 2020. Natural gas deliveries in 2021 increased 15% to 1,436 MMcfd as compared to 1,252 MMcfd in 2020. The increase in production was primarily due to increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher natural gas volumes in Trinidad, partially offset by lower natural gas volumes associated with the dispositions of the Marcellus Shale assets in the third quarter of 2020 and the China assets in the second quarter of 2021.During 2021, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,152 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $638 million. During 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $1,071 million. Gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2021 increased $230 million compared to 2020, primarily due to higher margins on crude oil and condensate and natural gas marketing activities. The margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and EOG's decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling May and June 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements.Operating and Other Expenses2022 compared to 2021. During 2022, operating expenses of $15,736 million were $3,196 million higher than the $12,540 million incurred during 2021. The following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 20222021Lease and Well$4.02 $3.75 Transportation Costs2.91 2.85 Gathering and Processing Costs1.87 1.85Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -Oil and Gas Properties10.21 11.58 Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.48 0.49 General and Administrative (G&A)1.72 1.69 Net Interest Expense0.54 0.59 Total (1)$21.75 $22.80 (1)Total excludes exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, gathering and processing costs, DD&A and G&A for 2022 compared to 2021 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.39Lease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property. Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses. Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, produced water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power. Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.Each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations. EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas. Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time. Lease and well expenses of $1,331 million in 2022 increased $196 million from $1,135 million in 2021 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($172 million) and higher workovers expenditures in the United States ($27 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting from increased production.Transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease or an aggregation point on EOG's gathering system to a downstream point of sale. Transportation costs include transportation fees, storage and terminal fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), the cost of dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.Transportation costs of $966 million in 2022 increased $103 million from $863 million in 2021 primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the Permian Basin ($98 million), the Eagle Ford play ($10 million) and the Dorado gas play ($7 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs related to production from the Rocky Mountain area ($8 million).Gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain NGLs fractionation fees paid to third parties. EOG pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract NGLs.Gathering and processing costs increased $62 million to $621 million in 2022 compared to $559 million in 2021 primarily due to increased gathering and processing fees related to production from the Permian Basin ($66 million) and increased operating and maintenance expenses related to production from the Permian Basin ($43 million) and the Eagle Ford play ($7 million), partially offset by decreased gathering and processing fees related to production from the Eagle Ford play ($30 million) and due to the sale of certain legacy natural gas assets in the Rocky Mountain area in the first quarter of 2022 ($28 million).DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations. There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments. Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period. DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets. DD&A expenses in 2022 decreased $109 million to $3,542 million from $3,651 million in 2021. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2022 were $117 million lower than in 2021 primarily due to lower unit rates in the United States ($472 million) and lower production in Trinidad ($15 million), partially offset by an increase in production in the United States ($375 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions related to higher average crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used in the prior year's reserve estimation process and to reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies. G&A expenses of $570 million in 2022 increased $59 million from $511 million in 2021 primarily due to a net increase in costs associated with corporate support activities, including employee-related expenses, and professional and other services.40Impairments include: amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions): 20222021Proved properties$120 $20 Unproved properties206 310 Other assets29 28 Inventories25 13 Firm commitment contracts2 5 Total$382 $376 Impairments of unproved oil and gas properties included charges of $38 million in 2021 due to the decision in the fourth quarter of 2021 to exit Block 36 and Block 49 in Oman.Taxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes. Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.Taxes other than income in 2022 increased $538 million to $1,585 million (7.0% of wellhead revenues) from $1,047 million (6.8% of wellhead revenues) in 2021. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes ($514 million), increased ad valorem/property taxes ($130 million) and increased payroll taxes ($7 million), partially offset by increased state severance tax refunds ($119 million), all in the United States.Other income, net, was $114 million in 2022 compared to other income, net, of $9 million in 2021. The increase of $105 million in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in interest income ($81 million) and higher equity income from ammonia plants in Trinidad ($28 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $2,142 million in 2022 compared to an income tax provision of $1,269 million in 2021, primarily due to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2022 increased to 22% from 21% in 2021. 412021 compared to 2020. During 2021, operating expenses of $12,540 million were $964 million lower than the $11,576 million incurred during 2020. The following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: 20212020Lease and Well$3.75 $3.85 Transportation Costs2.85 2.66 Gathering and Processing Costs1.85 1.66 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) -Oil and Gas Properties11.58 11.85 Other Property, Plant and Equipment0.49 0.47 General and Administrative (G&A)1.69 1.75 Net Interest Expense0.59 0.74 Total (1)$22.80 $22.98 (1)Total excludes exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.The primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, gathering and processing costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2021 compared to 2020 are set forth below. See ""Operating Revenues and Other"" above for a discussion of production volumes.Lease and well expenses of $1,135 million in 2021 increased $72 million from $1,063 million in 2020 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($33 million) and in Trinidad ($5 million), higher workovers expenditures in the United States ($25 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million); partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in Canada ($6 million) and as a result of the disposition of all of the China assets in the second quarter of 2021 ($5 million). Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting from increased production.Transportation costs of $863 million in 2021 increased $128 million from $735 million in 2020 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($121 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($22 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford play ($13 million).Gathering and processing costs increased $100 million to $559 million in 2021 compared to $459 million in 2020 primarily due to increased gathering and processing fees related to production from the Permian Basin ($51 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($10 million), increased operating costs in the Permian Basin ($26 million) and the Rocky Mountain area ($7 million) and increased administrative expenses in the United States ($15 million); partially offset by decreased gathering and processing fees in the Eagle Ford play ($5 million).DD&A expenses in 2021 increased $251 million to $3,651 million from $3,400 million in 2020. DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2021 were $235 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($307 million) and Trinidad ($12 million) and higher unit rates in Trinidad ($14 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($85 million). Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies. DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment in 2021 were $15 million higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in expense related to storage assets.G&A expenses of $511 million in 2021 increased $27 million from $484 million in 2020 primarily due to a net increase in costs associated with corporate support activities, including employee-related expenses and increased information system costs ($54 million); partially offset by a decrease in idle equipment and termination fees ($46 million).42Net interest expense of $178 million in 2021 was $27 million lower than 2020 primarily due to repayment in February 2021 of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021 ($29 million), repayment in June 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 ($9 million), repayment in April 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020 ($3 million) and lower interest payments for late royalty payments on Oklahoma properties ($6 million), partially offset by the issuance in April 2020 of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.950% Senior Notes due 2050 ($11 million) and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due 2030 ($10 million).Exploration costs of $154 million in 2021 increased $8 million from $146 million in 2020 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States.The following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions): 20212020Proved properties$20 $1,268 Unproved properties310 472 Other assets28 300 Inventories13 — Firm commitment contracts5 60 Total$376 $2,100 Impairments of proved properties in 2020 were primarily due to the decline in commodity prices and were primarily related to the write-down to fair value of legacy and non-core natural gas, crude oil and combo plays in the United States. Impairments of unproved oil and gas properties included charges of $38 million in 2021 due to the decision in the fourth quarter of 2021 to exit Block 36 and Block 49 in Oman and $252 million in 2020 for certain leasehold costs that are no longer expected to be developed before expiration. Impairments of other assets in 2020 were primarily for the write-down to fair value of sand and crude-by-rail assets and a commodity price-related write-down of other assets. Impairments of firm commitment contracts in 2020 were a result of the decision to exit the Horn River Basin in Canada.Taxes other than income in 2021 increased $569 million to $1,047 million (6.8% of wellhead revenues) from $478 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) in 2020. The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the United States ($522 million), increased severance/production taxes in Trinidad ($7 million) and decreased state severance tax refunds ($39 million).EOG recognized an income tax provision of $1,269 million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $134 million in 2020, primarily due to increased pretax income. The net effective tax rate for 2021 increased to 21% from 18% in 2020. The higher effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to EOG's foreign operations and stock-based compensation tax deficiencies increasing the effective tax rate on pretax income in 2021 and decreasing the effective tax rate on pretax loss in 2020.43Capital Resources and LiquidityCash FlowThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, were funds generated from operations and proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; dividend payments to stockholders; net repayment of debt; net cash paid for settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; and net collateral posted for financial commodity derivative contracts.2022 compared to 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities of $11,093 million in 2022 increased $2,302 million from $8,791 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in wellhead revenues ($7,415 million), partially offset by an increase in net cash paid for settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts ($2,863 million); an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($1,361 million); and an increase in cash operating expenses ($982 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $5,056 million in 2022 increased by $1,637 million from $3,419 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($981 million), net cash used in working capital associated with investing activities in 2022 ($375 million) compared to net cash provided by working capital associated with investing activities in 2021 ($200 million); an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($169 million); and an increase in other investing activities ($30 million), partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sales of assets ($118 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $5,273 million in 2022 included cash dividend payments ($5,148 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($118 million) and repayment of finance lease liabilities ($35 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2022 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($28 million). 2021 compared to 2020. Net cash provided by operating activities of $8,791 million in 2021 increased $3,783 million from $5,008 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in wellhead revenues ($8,090 million) and an increase in gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs ($230 million); partially offset by an increase in net cash paid for settlements of financial commodity derivative contracts ($1,709 million); an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($1,320 million); net cash used in working capital in 2021 ($817 million) compared to net cash provided by working capital in 2020 ($193 million); and an increase in cash operating expenses ($882 million).Net cash used in investing activities of $3,419 million in 2021 increased by $71 million from $3,348 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($394 million), partially offset by net cash provided by working capital associated with investing activities in 2021 ($200 million) compared to net cash used in working capital associated with investing activities in 2020 ($75 million); an increase in proceeds from the sales of assets ($39 million); and a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($9 million).Net cash used in financing activities of $3,493 million in 2021 included cash dividend payments ($2,684 million), repayments of long-term debt ($750 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($41 million) and repayment of finance lease liabilities ($37 million). Cash provided by financing activities in 2021 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($19 million). 44Total ExpendituresThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions): 202220212020Expenditure CategoryCapitalExploration and Development Drilling$3,675 $2,864 $2,664 Facilities411 405 347 Leasehold Acquisitions (1)186 215 265 Property Acquisitions (2)419 100 135 Capitalized Interest36 33 31 Subtotal4,727 3,617 3,442 Exploration Costs159 154 146 Dry Hole Costs45 71 13 Exploration and Development Expenditures4,931 3,842 3,601 Asset Retirement Costs298 127 117 Total Exploration and Development Expenditures5,229 3,969 3,718 Other Property, Plant and Equipment (3)381 286 395 Total Expenditures$5,610 $4,255 $4,113 (1)Leasehold acquisitions included $127 million, $45 million and $197 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.(2)Property acquisitions included $26 million, $5 million and $15 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.(3)Other property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $74 million and $174 million, primarily related to finance lease transactions for storage facilities in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Exploration and development expenditures of $4,931 million for 2022 were $1,089 million higher than the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($763 million) and increased property acquisitions ($319 million). The 2022 exploration and development expenditures of $4,931 million included $3,962 million in development drilling and facilities, $514 million in exploration, $419 million in property acquisitions and $36 million in capitalized interest. The 2021 exploration and development expenditures of $3,842 million included $3,172 million in development drilling and facilities, $537 million in exploration, $100 million in property acquisitions and $33 million in capitalized interest. The 2020 exploration and development expenditures of $3,601 million included $2,905 million in development drilling and facilities, $530 million in exploration, $135 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest. The level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors. EOG believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant. While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.45Financial Commodity Derivative TransactionsPresented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts settled during the year ended December 31, 2022 (closed) and remaining for 2023 and thereafter, as of February 16, 2023.

As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, EOG had outstanding $4,890 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $4,740 million and $5,577 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end. EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates. While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.During 2022, EOG funded its capital program and operations primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand. While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program, there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2022 and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero. EOG considers the availability of its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskDuring 2022, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, Australia, Oman and Canada. EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.OutlookPricing. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue. As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world economic and political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, the availabilities of other energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future. The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2023 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position. As of February 16, 2023, the average 2023 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $75.99 per barrel and $3.05 per MMBtu, respectively, representing a decrease of 19% for crude oil and a decrease of 54% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2022. See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for additional discussion of the impact of commodity prices (including fluctuations in commodity prices) on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Including the impact of EOG's crude oil and NGLs financial derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2023 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGLs price, is approximately $137 million for net income and $175 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. Including the impact of EOG's natural gas financial derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2023 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $35 million for net income and $44 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities. For information regarding EOG's crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 16, 2023, see ""Financial Commodity Derivative Transactions"" above.Capital. EOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States. In particular, EOG will be focused on United States drilling activity in its Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford play, Rocky Mountain area and Dorado gas play where it generates its highest rates-of-return. To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lessen inflationary pressure through efficiency gains and by locking in certain service costs for drilling and completion activities. In addition, EOG expects to spend a portion of its anticipated 2023 capital expenditures on leasing acreage, evaluating new prospects, gathering and processing infrastructure, transportation infrastructure and environmental projects. 48The total anticipated 2023 capital expenditures of approximately $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion, excluding acquisitions, non-cash transactions and exploration costs, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings. Operations. In 2023, crude oil and total crude oil equivalent production are expected to increase from 2022 levels. In 2023, EOG expects to continue to focus on mitigating inflationary pressure on operating costs through efficiency improvements.Cash Requirements. Certain of EOG's capital expenditures and operating expenses are subject to contracts with minimum commitments, including those that meet the definition of a lease under ASC ""Leases (Topic 842)"". In 2023, EOG anticipates the following cash requirements under these commitments (in millions):Finance Leases (1)$37 Operating Leases (1)323Leases Effective, Not Commenced (1)111Transportation and Storage Service Commitments (2) (3)832Purchase and Service Obligations (3)529Total Cash Requirements$1,832 (1) For more information on contracts that meet the definition of a lease under ASC ""Leases (Topic 842),"" see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Amounts exclude transportation and storage service commitments that meet the definition of a lease. Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2022. Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.(3) For more information on transportation and storage service commitments and purchase and service obligations, see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2023, EOG has $1.25 billion of senior notes maturing, which are expected to be repaid with cash on hand. Additionally, in 2023, EOG expects to pay interest of $175 million on senior notes. For more information on EOG's current and long-term debt, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash requirements to settle the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7, and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements) are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.EOG expects to fund its exploration, development and exploitation activities and other cash requirements, both in 2023 and in future years, primarily from internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. As discussed above, EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.49Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. EOG identifies certain accounting policies and estimates as critical based on, among other things, their impact on EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application. Critical accounting policies and estimates cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies and estimates. Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies and estimates:Proved Oil and Gas ReservesEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets. Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made. The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time. For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and ""Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.""Oil and Gas Exploration and Development CostsEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves. If commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed. In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed. Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The concept of sufficient progress is subject to significant judgment and may require further operational actions or require additional approvals from government agencies or partners in oil and gas operations, among other factors, the timing of which may delay management's determinations. See Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas PropertiesThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward or downward, earnings will increase or decrease, respectively.50Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. ImpairmentsOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term. Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the group. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC. In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value. Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain. In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future. Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future. During the five years ended December 31, 2022, WTI crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $(36.98) per barrel to $123.64 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.33 per MMBtu to $23.86 per MMBtu. Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the components extracted, including ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, among others, and the respective market pricing for each component. EOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas and the five-year Oil Price Information Services futures strip for NGLs components (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available. In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, NGLs prices, natural gas prices or estimated proved reserves diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary.See Notes 13 and 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosures of impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets.Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate. Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment. Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.51Information Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, goals, returns and rates of return, budgets, reserves, levels of production, capital expenditures, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward‐looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" ""strategy,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""target,"" ""aims,"" ""ambition,"" ""initiative,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""focused on,"" ""should"" and ""believe"" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward‐looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future financial or operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate returns and rates of return, replace or increase drilling locations, reduce or otherwise control drilling, completion and operating costs and capital expenditures, generate cash flows, pay down or refinance indebtedness, achieve, reach or otherwise meet initiatives, plans, goals, ambitions or targets with respect to emissions, other environmental matters, safety matters or other ESG (environmental/social/governance) matters, or pay and/or increase dividends are forward‐looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that such assumptions are accurate or will prove to have been correct or that any of such expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will be achieved on the expected or anticipated timelines. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:•the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs), natural gas and related commodities; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; •the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to (i) economically develop its acreage in, (ii) produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels and rates of return from, (iii) decrease or otherwise control its drilling, completion and operating costs and capital expenditures related to, and (iv) maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects and associated potential and existing drilling locations;•the success of EOG's cost-mitigation initiatives and actions in offsetting the impact of inflationary pressures on EOG's operating costs and capital expenditures;•the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas;•security threats, including cybersecurity threats and disruptions to our business and operations from breaches of our information technology systems, physical breaches of our facilities and other infrastructure or breaches of the information technology systems, facilities and infrastructure of third parties with which we transact business; •the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation, refining, and export facilities; •the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG's ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;•the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives (for example, with respect to air emissions); tax laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, carbon tax and emissions-related legislation); environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations affecting the leasing of acreage and permitting for oil and gas drilling and the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production; laws and regulations imposing additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating restrictions and conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to financial derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; 52•the impact of climate change-related policies and initiatives at the corporate and/or investor community levels and other potential developments related to climate change, such as (but not limited to) changes in consumer and industrial/commercial behavior, preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy; increased availability of, and increased consumer and industrial/commercial demand for, competing energy sources (including alternative energy sources); technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy;
