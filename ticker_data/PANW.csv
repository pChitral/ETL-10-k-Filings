1327567,PANW,Palo Alto Networks Inc,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1a or in other parts of this report. Overview We have pioneered the next generation of network security with our innovative platform that allows enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their networks and safely enable the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on their networks. The core of our platform is our Next-Generation Firewall, which delivers application, user, and content visibility and control integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture. Our products and services can address a broad range of our end-customers’ network security requirements, from the data center to the network perimeter, as well as the distributed enterprise, which includes branch offices and a growing number of mobile devices. We were founded in 2005 to address the limitations that exist in legacy approaches to network security and to restore the firewall as the most strategic point of network control. From 2005 to 2007, our activities were focused on research and development, which resulted in the commercial release of our first product, the PA-4000 Series, as well as our first subscription service, Threat Prevention, in 2007. Since then, we have continued to innovate and consistently introduce new products and services, including the PA-5000 Series and GlobalProtect subscription service in March 2011, and most recently the PA-200 and WildFire subscription service in November 2011. We derive revenue from sales of our products and services, which together comprise our platform. Product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our Next-Generation Firewall. All of our products incorporate our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, from branch offices to large data centers. Our platform can be centrally managed across an organization with our Panorama product. Services revenue includes sales from subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, and GlobalProtect subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware protection capabilities across fixed and mobile devices. When end-customers purchase a product, they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality, as well as support and maintenance in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. Sales of services increase our deferred revenue balance and contribute significantly to our positive cash flow provided by operating activities. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our global distributor channel partners, which, in turn, sell our products and services to our reseller network, which then sell to our end-customers. Our channel partners purchase our products and services at a discount to our list prices and then resell them to our end-customers. Our channel partners receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us and generally do not stock appliances. We had over 9,000 end-customers in over 100 countries as of July 31, 2012. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications. During fiscal 2012, 64% of our revenue was generated from the Americas, 24% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and 12% from Asia Pacific and Japan (APAC). As of July 31, 2012, we had 755 employees. -46- Table of Contents We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, revenues were $255.1 million, $118.6 million, and $48.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 115% for fiscal 2012 and 143% for fiscal 2011, and our net income (loss) was $0.7 million, $(12.5) million and $(21.1) million, respectively. We have generated positive cash flow provided by operating activities in each of our last nine fiscal quarters. On July 25, 2012, we closed our IPO, in which 7,130,000 shares of common stock were sold to the public (inclusive of 5,617,259 shares of common stock sold by us). The public offering price of the shares sold in the IPO was $42.00 per share. The total gross proceeds from the offering were $299.5 million. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, offering expenses payable by us, and net proceeds received by the selling stockholders, the aggregate net proceeds received by us totaled approximately $215.4 million. We believe that the growth of our business and our short and long term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last few years. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products, as well as effectively hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income (loss) and margin below under “—Financial Overview” and “—Results of Operations.” Deferred revenue, cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities, and free cash flow are discussed immediately below the following table. Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in thousands) Total revenue $ 255,138 $ 118,597 $ 48,782 Year-over-year percentage increase 115.1 % 143.1 % 265.4 % Gross margin percentage 72.3 % 72.8 % 68.0 % Operating income (loss) $ 3,891 $ (10,404 ) $ (20,657 ) Operating margin percentage 1.5 % (8.8 )% (42.3 )% Total deferred revenue at period end $ 135,808 $ 67,255 $ 24,121 Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities $ 77,368 $ 32,102 $ (2,683 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 62,803 $ 19,102 $ (4,368 ) • Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support and maintenance revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. -47- Table of Contents • Cash Flow Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for both subscription and support and maintenance. Monitoring cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business. • Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the purchases of property, equipment, and other assets, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. For fiscal 2011, our free cash flow was impacted by an increase in property, equipment, and other assets, of which $7.3 million was due to leasehold improvements for our headquarters. For fiscal 2012, our free cash flow was impacted by an increase in property, equipment, and other assets, of which $3.8 million was due to purchases of demonstration units for use by our customers in evaluating our products and services and $3.2 million was related to capitalized internally developed software costs related to the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We expect purchases of demonstration units to remain at consistent levels or increase as we introduce new products. We expect to continue to capitalize additional costs related to our enterprise resource planning system through the first half of fiscal 2013 and beyond. Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Cash Flow: Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities $ 77,368 $ 32,102 $ (2,683 ) Less: purchase of property, equipment, and other assets 14,565 13,000 1,685 Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 62,803 $ 19,102 $ (4,368 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (14,565 ) $ (13,000 ) $ (1,685 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 219,322 $ 2,580 $ 1,837 Financial Overview Revenue We generate revenue from the sales of our products and services. As discussed further in “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Our total revenue is comprised of the following: • Product Revenue. The substantial majority of our product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and Virtual Systems Upgrades. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter-to-quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. • Services Revenue. Services revenue is generated primarily from Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, and GlobalProtect subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our subscriptions are priced as a percentage of the appliance’s list price. Our contractual subscription and support and maintenance terms are -48- Table of Contents typically one year, and can be up to three years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue to remain at consistent levels or increase as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing services contracts, and expand our end-customer base. Cost of Revenue Our total cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of services revenue. Personnel costs associated with our operations and global customer support organizations consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and share-based compensation. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs allocated based on headcount. • Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer. Our cost of product revenue also includes product testing costs, allocated costs, warranty costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. • Cost of Services Revenue. Cost of services revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support organization, allocated costs, and URL filtering database service fees. We expect our cost of services revenue to increase as our end-customer base grows. Gross Margin Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between products and services. For sales of our products, our higher throughput firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower throughput firewall products within each product series. For sales of our services, our subscriptions typically have higher gross margins than our support and maintenance. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow in response to demand for our products and services. As of July 31, 2012, we expect to recognize approximately $62.5 million of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of three years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. • Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated facilities costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. • Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs including commission costs. We expense commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, office equipment and software, depreciation of capital equipment, professional services, and allocated facilities costs. In the last 12 months, we have significantly increased the size of our sales force and have also substantially grown our local sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing -49- Table of Contents expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. • General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs as well as professional services. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional legal fees and costs associated with pending litigation, accounting, insurance, investor relations, and other costs associated with being a public company, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. Refer to the discussion under “Legal Proceedings” included in Part I, Item 3 of this report for information related to pending litigation. Interest Income Interest income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our cash in money-market funds. We expect interest income will increase as we grow our cash and investments portfolio depending on our average investment balances during the period, types and mix of investments, and market interest rates. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability. Convertible preferred stock warrants were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other expense. These warrants were exercised during the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and therefore, we will no longer incur any charges related to these warrants. We expect other expense to decrease in the near term as a result of the exercise of the warrants and to remain at a consistent level thereafter. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintained a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards and research and development and other tax credits. We expect the provision for income taxes to increase in absolute dollars in future years. We have begun to reorganize our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. This proposed corporate structure may allow us to reduce our overall effective tax rate over the long term through changes in how we use our intellectual property, international procurement, and sales operations. While we expect this corporate structure to result in a percentage of our pre-tax income being subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, we are only in the initial phases of implementing this corporate structure, and any reduction in our overall effective tax rate that we may realize as a result of this proposed corporate structure would not have a material impact on our financial results in the near term. Moreover, we will incur expenses in the near term to establish this corporate structure, including expenses for establishing various international entities, adopting research and development cost-sharing arrangements, and entering into certain licenses and other contractual arrangements between us and our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. However, we do not expect these expenses to have a material effect on our operating results. -50- Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables summarize our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.

The revenue growth reflects the increasing demand for our product and service offerings. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by an aggregate increase of more than 75% in product unit volume and the introduction of our higher-end PA-5000 Series as opposed to increases in the average selling prices of our other products, -52- Table of Contents which remained relatively flat. The increase in services revenue was primarily driven by new end-customers and, to a lesser extent, additional sales of subscription services to our existing end-customer base. Our total number of end-customers increased to over 9,000 at July 31, 2012 from approximately 4,700 at July 31, 2011. With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of this revenue increase because of its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. We also experienced a significant increase in U.S. government sales as a result of our continued investment in our expanded U.S. government sales force. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased during this period primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of partners in these theaters. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue: Product $ 44,615 $ 21,766 $ 22,849 Services 25,938 10,507 15,431 Total cost of revenue $ 70,553 $ 32,273 $ 38,280 Gross profit: Product $ 129,847 74.4 % $ 63,034 74.3 % $ 66,813 0.1 % Services 54,738 67.8 % 23,290 68.9 % 31,448 (1.1 )% Total gross profit $ 184,585 72.3 % $ 86,324 72.8 % $ 98,261 (0.5 )% Gross margin decreased 50 basis points for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase of 10 basis points in product margin was primarily due to an increase in sales volume as opposed to changes in average selling prices of our hardware on a per unit basis. This increase in margin was partially offset by the impact of introducing our PA-200, which is a lower throughput firewall product. On average, margins for firewall products with lower throughput are less than firewall products with higher throughput. The decrease of 110 basis points in services margin was primarily due to a decrease in average margins on revenue from support and maintenance as a result of an increase in personnel and other costs to support our expanding end-customer base, partially offset by higher margin subscriptions sales, while the mix in services revenue was largely unchanged on a period-over-period basis. -53- Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands) Operating expenses: Research and development $ 38,570 15.1 % $ 21,366 18.0 % $ 17,204 80.5 % Sales and marketing 115,917 45.4 % 62,254 52.5 % 53,663 86.2 % General and administrative 26,207 10.3 % 13,108 11.1 % 13,099 99.9 % Total operating expenses $ 180,694 70.8 % $ 96,728 81.6 % $ 83,966 86.8 % Includes share-based compensation of: Research and development $ 3,733 $ 1,020 $ 2,713 266.0 % Sales and marketing 4,267 1,133 3,134 276.6 % General and administrative 5,151 2,374 2,777 117.0 % Total $ 13,151 $ 4,527 $ 8,624 190.5 % Research and development expense increased $17.2 million, or 80.5%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $11.6 million as we increased our headcount to support continued investment in our future product and service offerings and an increase in allocated costs and development costs of $4.4 million. Sales and marketing expense increased $53.7 million, or 86.2%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $30.6 million due to an increase in headcount and commissions. Additionally, marketing activity increased $7.1 million related to trade shows and conventions and marketing development programs, travel costs increased $5.0 million, and allocated costs increased $4.6 million. The remaining increase was due to increases in depreciation, facilities costs, and professional services costs. General and administrative expense increased $13.1 million, or 99.9%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $6.0 million and an increase in professional services costs of $5.2 million primarily related to overall growth to support the business and infrastructure building in preparation for being a public company. The remaining increase was due to an increase in allocated costs. Other Expense, Net Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands) Other expense net $ 1,110 $ 1,651 $ (541 ) (32.8 )% The change in other expense, net was due to the increase in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. In December 2011 and January 2012, these preferred stock warrants were exercised by the holders. As a result, we issued 197,000 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock and 24,000 shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, all of which converted to common stock at the time of our IPO. The amount for fiscal 2012 represents the change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability from the beginning of the period to the dates of exercise of the warrants. We do not expect to incur expenses related to these warrants in future periods. -54- Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 2,062 $ 476 $ 1,586 333.2 % Effective tax rate 73.7 % (3.9 )% We incurred tax expense for fiscal 2012, primarily due to foreign taxes, state income taxes, and U.S. federal alternative minimum tax. We have a full valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets. The increase in the provision for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in state income taxes, U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, and foreign taxes as a result of an increase in our taxable income.

The revenue growth reflects the increasing demand for our product and service offerings. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by an aggregate increase of more than 90% in product unit volume and the introduction of our higher-end PA-5000 Series as opposed to increases in the average selling prices of our other products. The increase in services revenue was primarily driven by new end-customers and, to a lesser extent, additional sales of subscription services to our existing end-customer base. Our total number of end-customers increased to approximately 4,700 at July 31, 2011 from approximately 1,800 at July 31, 2010. With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of this revenue increase because of its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased during this period primarily due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of partners in these theaters. EMEA grew at the fastest rate due to our expanded sales force and number of partners in this theater relative to the other theaters. -55- Table of Contents Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Year Ended July 31, 2011 2010 Change Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue: Product $ 21,766 $ 10,822 $ 10,944 Services 10,507 4,812 5,695 Total cost of revenue $ 32,273 $ 15,634 $ 16,639 Gross profit: Product $ 63,034 74.3 % $ 25,967 70.6 % $ 37,067 3.7 % Services 23,290 68.9 % 7,181 59.9 % 16,109 9.0 % Total gross profit $ 86,324 72.8 % $ 33,148 68.0 % $ 53,176 4.8 % Gross margin increased 480 basis points for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase of 370 basis points in product margin was primarily due to changes in our product mix, including the impact of introducing our relatively higher throughput PA-5000 Series, and to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Sales of our higher throughput firewall products represented a larger proportion of the product volume sold during this period than our lower throughput firewall products. The increase of 900 basis points in services margin was primarily due to an increase in the volume of subscription sales, which have higher margins than our support and maintenance, partially offset by an increase in personnel and other costs to support our expanding end-customer base.

Sales and marketing expense increased $32.5 million, or 109.4%, for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $22.8 million due to an increase in headcount and commissions. Ending headcount more than doubled from July 31, 2010 to July 31, 2011. Additionally, marketing -56- Table of Contents activity increased $3.4 million related to trade shows and conventions and marketing development programs, travel costs increased $2.7 million, and allocated costs increased $1.6 million. The remaining increase was due to an increase in facilities costs. General and administrative expense increased $1.8 million, or 16.1%, for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $4.5 million related to overall growth to support the business, of which $1.6 million related to a charge for share-based compensation due to the modification of the terms of certain share-based awards for a former employee. There was an additional increase related to professional services of $2.2 million related to legal services for litigation and other services to support increased business activity. These increases were partially offset by a $6.0 million reduction in legal settlement expenses related to a litigation settlement agreement recorded in fiscal 2010.

We have a full valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets. The increase in the provision for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in foreign income taxes on profits realized by our foreign subsidiaries due to our international expansion. Liquidity and Capital Resources July 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 322,642 $ 40,517 $ 18,835 Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 77,368 $ 32,102 $ (2,683 ) Cash used in investing activities (14,565 ) (13,000 ) (1,685 ) Cash provided by financing activities 219,322 2,580 1,837 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 282,125 $ 21,682 $ (2,531 ) -57- Table of Contents At July 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents of $322.6 million were held for working capital purposes, of which approximately $2.9 million was held outside of the United States and not presently available to fund domestic operations and obligations. If we were to repatriate cash held outside of the United States, it could be subject to U.S. income taxes, less any previously paid foreign income taxes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Prior to fiscal 2010, we financed our operations primarily through private sales of equity securities and, more recently, cash generated from operations and our IPO. On July 25, 2012, we closed our IPO, in which 7,130,000 shares of common stock were sold to the public (inclusive of 5,617,259 shares of common stock sold by us). The public offering price of the shares sold in the IPO was $42.00 per share. The total gross proceeds from the offering were $299.5 million. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, offering expenses payable by us, and net proceeds received by the selling stockholders, the aggregate net proceeds received by us totaled approximately $215.4 million. In March 2012, we allowed our unused $10 million line of credit to expire. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. Operating Activities Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs and purchases from our contract manufacturer. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and increases in personnel costs as we grow our business. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was $77.4 million and $32.1 million, respectively. Cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2010 was $2.7 million. For fiscal 2012, operating activities provided $77.4 million in cash as a result of net income of $0.7 million, non-cash charges of $20.7 million, and a net change of $55.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The net change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $68.6 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increases in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance, partially offset by a $16.0 million increase in accounts receivable and a $11.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. Our day’s sales outstanding, or DSO, defined as the number of days it takes to turn our average quarterly accounts receivable into cash based on a 90 day average, was 50 days as of July 31, 2012. For fiscal 2011, operating activities provided $32.1 million in cash, primarily as a result of a net loss of $12.5 million, offset by non-cash charges of $8.5 million as well as a net change of $36.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges included share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $43.1 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increases in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance and a $9.1 million increase in accrued compensation and other liabilities primarily due to deferred rent related to moving our headquarters from Sunnyvale, California to Santa Clara, California. These increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales and a $5.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of growth in our business. Our DSO was 57 days as of July 31, 2011. For fiscal 2010, operating activities used $2.7 million in cash as a result of a net loss of $21.1 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $2.4 million as well as a net change of $16.0 million in our net operating -58- Table of Contents assets and liabilities. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $18.5 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increases in sales of support and maintenance and subscriptions and a $9.4 million increase in accrued and other liabilities as a result of growth in our business. These increases were partially offset by a $10.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales and a $1.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of growth in our business. Our DSO was 65 days as of July 31, 2010. Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We expect to continue to make such purchases to support continued growth of our business. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $14.6 million, $13.0 million, and $1.7 million, respectively, and was primarily the result of capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment, including $7.0 million for fiscal 2012 related to purchases of demonstration units for use by our customers in evaluating our products and services and capitalized internally developed software costs related to the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system and $7.3 million for fiscal 2011 related to moving our headquarters from Sunnyvale, California to Santa Clara, California. Financing Activities Our financing activities have primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our IPO and redeemable convertible preferred stock and proceeds from the exercises of stock options. For fiscal 2012, financing activities provided $219.3 million in cash, primarily as a result of net proceeds to us from our IPO and the exercises of stock options. For fiscal 2011 and 2010, financing activities provided $2.6 million and $1.8 million in cash, respectively, primarily as a result of proceeds from the exercises of stock options. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2012: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1Year 1 - 3 Years 3- 5 Years More Than 5Years (in thousands) Operating lease obligations(1) $ 14,239 $ 2,707 $ 5,295 $ 4,716 $ 1,521 Purchase obligations(2) 23,099 23,099 — — — Total(3)(4) $ 37,338 $ 25,806 $ 5,295 $ 4,716 $ 1,521 (1) Consists of contractual obligations from non-cancellable office space under operating leases. (2) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our independent contract manufacturer. (3) No amounts related to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-10, Income Taxes, are included. As of July 31, 2012, we had approximately $0.4 million of tax liabilities primarily related to withholding taxes. (4) In September 2012, we entered into two lease agreements for space in Santa Clara, California. Both leases expire in July 2023. We will make payments of approximately $0.5 million during fiscal 2013, $14.5 million from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2015, $17.7 million from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2017, and $61.7 million from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2023. -59- Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through July 31, 2012, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the sales of hardware and software products, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services primarily through a direct sales force and indirect relationships with distributors, resellers and strategic partners, which we refer to collectively as partners, and, to a lesser extent, directly to end-customers. Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: • Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. We rely upon non-cancelable sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. • Delivery has Occurred. We use shipping documents or transmissions of service contract registration codes to verify delivery. • The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. • Collectability is Reasonably Assured. We assess collectability based on credit analysis and payment history. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. At the time of shipment, product revenue generally meets the criteria for fixed or determinable fees as our partners receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us. In addition, payment from our partners is not contingent on the partner’s success in sales to end-customers. Our partners generally do not stock appliances and only have limited stock rotation rights and no price protection rights. When necessary, we make certain estimates and maintain allowances for sales returns, stock rotation, and other programs based on our historical experience. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and management’s judgment. If actual results deviate significantly from our estimates, our revenue could be adversely affected. We recognize services revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance ratably over the contractual service period, which is typically one year, with some up to three years. Other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and has not been significant to date. Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support and maintenance, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services. Products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables typically include proprietary operating system software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our -60- Table of Contents products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price (BESP), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting using the relative estimated selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting any specified performance conditions. To determine the estimated selling price in multiple-element arrangements, we establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, for subscriptions and support and maintenance, based on the renewal rates and discounts offered to partners. If VSOE of selling price cannot be established for a deliverable, we establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality from our competitors, we are unable to obtain comparable pricing of our competitors’ products with similar functionality on a standalone basis. Therefore, we have not been able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price can be established for a deliverable, we establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing. Historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), offering type (products or services), and whether or not the opportunity was identified by our sales force or by our partners. In analyzing historical transaction pricing, we evaluate whether a majority of the prices charged for a product, as represented by a percentage of list price, fall within a reasonable range. To further support the best estimate of selling price as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and our revenue could be adversely affected. In multiple-element arrangements where software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned estimated selling price hierarchy. The arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when the VSOE of fair value of the undelivered items exists. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. In determining VSOE of fair value, we evaluate whether a substantial majority of the historical prices charged for a product or service sold on a standalone basis, as represented by a percentage of list price, fall within a reasonably narrow range. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of: (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless support and maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Share-Based Compensation Compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director awards, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. The fair value of option awards and purchases under our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2012 ESPP) is estimated on the grant date. The share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized using a straight-line basis over the -61- Table of Contents requisite service periods of the awards. We estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures. The fair value of options and 2012 ESPP purchases is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our option-pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and other highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation for our awards. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax liability as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. -62- Table of Contents Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted. Contract Manufacturer Liabilities We outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer and payments to it are a significant portion of our product cost of revenues. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage our relationship with our independent contract manufacturer, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products, we generally do not own the manufactured products. Product title transfers from our independent contract manufacturer to us and immediately to our partner upon shipment. Our independent contract manufacturer assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturer, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure. As of July 31, 2012, we had approximately $23.1 million of open orders with our contract manufacturer that are non-cancelable. Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed. From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are vigorously defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. Refer to the discussion under “Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation” in Note 4 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for information related to pending litigation. Warranties We generally provide a one-year warranty on hardware and a three-month warranty on software. We accrue for potential warranty claims as a component of cost of product revenues based on historical experience and other data. Accrued warranty is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is reviewed periodically for adequacy. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin could be adversely affected. To date, we have not accrued any significant costs associated with our warranty. -63- Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Singapore dollar and Euro. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on foreign-denominated accounts receivable at July 31, 2012 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions. As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. Dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts, since exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on our operating results and cash flows. -64- Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:21:30.147742

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1a or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We have pioneered the next generation of network security with our innovative platform that allows enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their networks and safely enable the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on their networks. The core of our platform is our Next-Generation Firewall, which delivers application, user, and content visibility and control as well as protection against cyber threats integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture. Our products and services can address a broad range of our end-customers’ network security requirements, from the data center to the network perimeter, as well as the distributed enterprise, which includes branch offices and a growing number of mobile devices. We derive revenue from sales of our products and services, which together comprise our platform. Product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our Next-Generation Firewall which is available in hardware and virtualized platforms. All of our products incorporate our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. These capabilities include: application visibility and control (App-ID), user identification (User-ID), site-to-site VPN, remote access SSL VPN, and Quality-of-Service (QoS). Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization which range from the PA-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to the PA-5060, which is designed for high-speed data centers. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in the hardware platforms is also available in the VM-Series virtual firewalls which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments. Multiple firewalls can leverage the WildFire appliance, WF-500, which identifies, analyzes, and blocks known and unknown malware in a private cloud-based environment. Our platform can be centrally managed in both virtualized and hardware platforms across an organization with our Panorama product. Services revenue includes sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, GlobalProtect, and WildFire subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices. When end-customers purchase a product, they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality, as well as support and maintenance in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. Sales of these services increase our deferred revenue balance and contribute significantly to our positive cash flow provided by operating activities. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our global distributor channel partners, which, in turn, sell our products and services to our reseller network, which then sell to our end-customers. Our channel partners purchase our products and services at a discount to our list prices before reselling them to our end-customers. Our channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us and generally do not stock appliances. For the fiscal year 2013, we added more than 4,800 new customers, including leading government organizations, large healthcare organizations, technology leaders and some of the largest Fortune 100 companies in the world. We had more than 13,500 end-customers in over 120 countries as of July 31, 2013. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications. During fiscal 2013, 63% of our revenue was generated from the Americas, 23% from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), and 14% from Asia Pacific and Japan (APAC). As of July 31, 2013, we had 1,147 employees. We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. For fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, revenues were $396.1 million, $255.1 million, and $118.6 million, respectively, representing year over year growth of 55% for fiscal 2013 and 115% for fiscal 2012, despite continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, in particular, weakness in EMEA and a slowdown in spending by the U.S. Government. These macroeconomic factors may continue to impact overall spending in information technology (IT) by our customers, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.We continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in several new product offerings during fiscal 2013. These new product offerings include: the VM-Series, an all-software virtualized next-generation firewall platform that brings next-generation network security into the virtualized data center environment; the paid subscription service for - 37 -Table of ContentsWildFire, our cloud-based modern malware prevention service platform; the WF-500 appliance which provides the ability to deploy WildFire in a customer's private cloud; the PA-3000 Series firewalls that provide mid-range appliance options for enterprise customers; and lastly, the M-100 management appliance, which offers an easy to deploy, high-performance, dedicated appliance for our Panorama management system.Fiscal 2013 Financial Highlights•We added over 4,800 new end-customers during fiscal 2013 and we had more than 13,500 end customers in over 120 countries as of July 31, 2013. •Total revenue increased 55% to $396.1 million during fiscal 2013 from $255.1 million during fiscal 2012.•Revenue increased 53% in Americas, 48% in EMEA and 82% in APAC during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.•Service revenue increased 89% to $152.4 million during fiscal 2013 from $80.7 million during fiscal 2012.•Service revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 38% during fiscal 2013 from 32% during fiscal 2012, which reflected the increasing recurring revenue in the business model and the rapid adoption of higher margin subscriptions services in our customer base.•As of July 31, 2013, we had $436.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. •Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 48% to $114.5 million during fiscal 2013 from $77.4 million during fiscal 2012. •Deferred revenue increased 84% to $249.2 million as of July 31, 2013 from $135.8 million as July 31, 2012 reflected the increased adoption of our support and maintenance and all our subscriptions services.•We completed the reorganization of our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Through changes in international procurement and sales operations, our corporate structure may cause short-term volatility but is expected to reduce our overall effective tax rate over the long term. We believe that the growth of our business and our short and long term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products, as well as effectively hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected. Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income (loss) and margin below under “—Financial Overview” and “—Results of Operations.” Deferred revenue, cash flow provided by operating activities, and free cash flow(non-GAAP) are discussed immediately below the following table. July 31, 2013 2012 (in thousands)Total deferred revenue $249,230 $135,808Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$436,935 $322,642- 38 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 2011 (dollars in thousands)Total revenue$396,107 $255,138 $118,597Year over year percentage increase55.3 % 115.1% 143.1 %Gross margin percentage72.3 % 72.3% 72.8 %Operating income (loss)$(18,621) $3,891 $(10,404)Operating margin percentage(4.7)% 1.5% (8.8)%Cash flow provided by operating activities$114,519 $77,368 $32,102Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$92,077 $62,803 $19,102 •Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support and maintenance revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. •Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and support and maintenance. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business. •Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the purchases of property, equipment, and other assets, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet.

As discussed further in “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Our total revenue is comprised of the following: •Product Revenue. The substantial majority of our product revenue is derived from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, Virtual Systems Upgrades, and the VM-Series. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.- 39 -Table of Contents •Services Revenue. Services revenue is derived primarily from Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, GlobalProtect, and WildFire subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our subscriptions are priced as a percentage of the appliance’s list price. Our contractual subscription and support and maintenance terms are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue to remain at consistent levels or increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing services contracts, and expand our end-customer base. Cost of Revenue Our total cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of services revenue. Our cost of revenue includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, bonuses, and share-based compensation associated with our operations and global customer support organizations. Our cost of revenue also includes allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. •Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer. Our cost of product revenue also includes product testing costs, allocated costs, warranty costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. •Cost of Services Revenue. Cost of services revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support organization, allocated costs, and URL filtering database service fees. We expect our cost of services revenue to increase as our end-customer base grows. Gross Margin Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between products and services. For sales of our products, our higher throughput firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower throughput firewall products within each product series. For sales of our services, our subscriptions typically have higher gross margins than our support and maintenance. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, allocated costs, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars, although they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period, as we continue to grow in response to demand for our products and services. As of July 31, 2013, we expect to recognize approximately $133.6 million of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of three years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. •Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. •Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs including commission costs. We expense commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, office equipment and software, depreciation of capital equipment, professional services, and allocated costs. In the last 12 months, we have significantly increased the size of our sales force and have also substantially grown our sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. •General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs as well as professional services. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, and legal organizations. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We - 40 -Table of Contentsexpect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional legal costs related to ongoing IP litigation, and additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, investor relations, and other costs associated with being a public company, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. Refer to the discussion under “Legal Proceedings” included in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to pending litigation. Interest Income Interest income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. We expect interest income will increase as we grow our cash and investments portfolio depending on our average investment balances during the period, types and mix of investments, and market interest rates. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability. Convertible preferred stock warrants were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other expense. These warrants were exercised during the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and therefore, no charges related to these warrants were incurred after that date. We expect other expense to fluctuate depending on foreign exchange rate movements. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the United States, income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and foreign withholding taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and research and development and other tax credits. We expect the provision for income taxes to increase in absolute dollars in future years. We have reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. This corporate structure may cause volatility to our overall effective tax rate in the short term but is expected to reduce our overall effective tax rate over the long term through changes in international procurement and sales operations.Results of Operations The following tables summarize our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period to period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. - 41 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands)Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Revenue: Product$243,707 $174,462 $84,800Services152,400 80,676 33,797Total revenue396,107 255,138 118,597Cost of revenue: Product63,412 44,615 21,766Services46,344 25,938 10,507Total cost of revenue109,756 70,553 32,273Total gross profit286,351 184,585 86,324Operating expenses: Research and development62,482 38,570 21,366Sales and marketing199,771 115,917 62,254General and administrative42,719 26,207 13,108Total operating expenses304,972 180,694 96,728Operating income (loss)(18,621) 3,891 (10,404)Interest income484 18 3Other expense, net(519) (1,110) (1,651)Income (loss) before income taxes(18,656) 2,799 (12,052)Provision for income taxes10,590 2,062 476Net income (loss)$(29,246) $737 $(12,528) - 42 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 2011 (as a percentage of revenue)Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Revenue: Product61.5 % 68.4 % 71.5 %Services38.5 % 31.6 % 28.5 %Total revenue100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of revenue: Product16.0 % 17.5 % 18.4 %Services11.7 % 10.2 % 8.8 %Total cost of revenue27.7 % 27.7 % 27.2 %Total gross profit72.3 % 72.3 % 72.8 %Operating expenses: Research and development15.8 % 15.1 % 18.0 %Sales and marketing50.4 % 45.4 % 52.5 %General and administrative10.8 % 10.3 % 11.1 %Total operating expenses77.0 % 70.8 % 81.6 %Operating income (loss)(4.7)% 1.5 % (8.8)%Interest income0.1 % — % — %Other expense, net(0.1)% (0.4)% (1.4)%Income (loss) before income taxes(4.7)% 1.1 % (10.2)%Provision for income taxes2.7 % 0.8 % 0.4 %Net income (loss)(7.4)% 0.3 % (10.6)% Comparison of Fiscal 2013 and 2012 Revenue Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Revenue: Product$243,707 61.5% $174,462 68.4% $69,245 39.7%Services152,400 38.5% 80,676 31.6% 71,724 88.9%Total revenue$396,107 100.0% $255,138 100.0% $140,969 55.3%Revenue by geographic theater: Americas$247,616 62.5% $161,873 63.4% $85,743 53.0%EMEA91,496 23.1% 61,994 24.3% 29,502 47.6%APAC56,995 14.4% 31,271 12.3% 25,724 82.3%Total revenue$396,107 100.0% $255,138 100.0% $140,969 55.3%Product revenue increased $69.2 million, or 39.7%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Approximately two-thirds of the increase was driven by our newly introduced PA-3000 Series firewalls and M-100 management appliance. The remaining increase was driven by a greater than 50% increase in product unit volume attributable to sales of our PA-5000 Series and PA-200 firewalls.Service revenue increased $71.7 million, or 88.9%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Approximately half of the increase was related to support and maintenance as a result of an increase in total end-customers to more than 13,500 at July 31, 2013 from more than 9,000 at July 31, 2012. The remaining increase was due to an increase in subscriptions from new and existing - 43 -Table of Contentsend-customers. The relative increases in revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance will fluctuate over time, depending on the mix of services revenue and the introduction of new services offerings.With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the increase in revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of partners in these theaters.

Service cost increased $20.4 million, or 78.7%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in personnel costs of $9.5 million, including share-based compensation of $2.9 million. The remaining increase was attributable to other costs incurred to expand our customer service capabilities to support our growing end-customer base. Gross margin for fiscal 2013 remained consistent with fiscal 2012. The decrease of 40 basis points in product margin was due to an 80 basis point decrease as a result of the introduction of our PA-3000 Series firewalls, WF-500 appliance and our M-100 management appliance, which will have lower product margins until volume and related cost savings increase, partially offset by decreases in manufacturing costs for other appliances. The increase of 180 basis points in services margin was due to an increase in subscription, support and maintenance without a proportionate increase in our global customer service organization costs. The mix in services revenue was largely unchanged on a period over period basis.Operating Expenses Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Operating expenses: Research and development$62,482 15.8% $38,570 15.1% $23,912 62.0%Sales and marketing199,771 50.4% 115,917 45.4% 83,854 72.3%General and administrative42,719 10.8% 26,207 10.3% 16,512 63.0%Total operating expenses$304,972 77.0% $180,694 70.8% $124,278 68.8%Includes share-based compensation of: Research and development$9,931 $3,733 $6,198 166.0%Sales and marketing20,493 4,267 16,226 380.3%General and administrative9,101 5,151 3,950 76.7%Total$39,525 $13,151 $26,374 200.5%- 44 -Table of ContentsResearch and development expense increased $23.9 million, or 62.0%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in personnel costs of $16.1 million related to increasing our headcount and share-based compensation, an increase in allocated costs of $3.7 million, and an increase in development costs of $2.8 million to support continued investment in our future product and service offerings.Sales and marketing expense increased $83.9 million, or 72.3%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in personnel costs of $58.0 million largely due to an increase in headcount, share-based compensation, and commission costs, an increase in allocated costs of $10.7 million, and an increase in marketing activity of $5.6 million related to demand generation activities, trade shows, and other marketing activities. The remaining increase was due to an increase in travel and entertainment costs of $5.6 million, professional service costs of $2.0 million, and office equipment and software costs of $1.9 million in support of our sales efforts. General and administrative expense increased $16.5 million, or 63.0%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in professional services costs of $6.9 million, including expenses related to ongoing IP litigation with Juniper of $3.6 million. We expect that these litigation expenses will increase in fiscal 2014 as we approach the February 2014 trial date. The remaining increase was due to an increase in personnel costs of $6.6 million, and an increase in allocated costs of $2.3 million related to overall growth to support the business and building our infrastructure to meet the regulatory requirements of being a public company. Other Expense, Net Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Other expense, net$519 $1,110 $(591) (53.2)%Other expense, net consisted primarily of foreign currency remeasurement losses for fiscal 2013 and the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability for fiscal 2012. The decrease in other expense, net was due to the elimination of the expense related to preferred stock warrant liability as a result of exercise of these warrants by the holders in December 2011 and January 2012, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency remeasurement loss.Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Provision for income taxes$10,590 $2,062 $8,528 413.6%Effective tax rate(56.8)% 73.7% We recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2013 due to U.S. federal income taxes, state income taxes, foreign income taxes, and foreign withholding taxes. We have a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets. The provision for income taxes increased for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to a significant increase in domestic taxable income after full utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, our global operations and foreign presence expanded year over year giving rise to additional foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we completed the reorganization of our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure may cause volatility to our overall effective tax rate in the short term but is expected to reduce our overall effective tax rate over the long term through changes in international procurement and sales operations.Comparison of Fiscal 2012 and 2011 - 45 -Table of Contents Revenue Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Revenue: Product$174,462 68.4% $84,800 71.5% $89,662 105.7%Services80,676 31.6% 33,797 28.5% 46,879 138.7%Total revenue$255,138 100.0% $118,597 100.0% $136,541 115.1%Revenue by geographic theater: Americas$161,873 63.4% $73,145 61.7% $88,728 121.3%EMEA61,994 24.3% 32,504 27.4% 29,490 90.7%APAC31,271 12.3% 12,948 10.9% 18,323 141.5%Total revenue$255,138 100.0% $118,597 100.0% $136,541 115.1%Product revenue increased $89.7 million, or 105.7%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily driven by an aggregate increase of more than 75% in product unit volume and the introduction of our higher-end PA-5000 Series as opposed to increases in the average selling prices of our other products, which remained relatively flat.Service revenue increased $46.9 million, or 138.7%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily driven by new end-customers and, to a lesser extent, additional sales of subscription services to our existing end-customer base. Our total number of end-customers increased to over 9,000 at July 31, 2012 from approximately 4,700 at July 31, 2011.With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of partners in these theaters.

The increase of 10 basis points in product margin was primarily due to an increase in sales volume as opposed to changes in average selling prices of our hardware on a per unit basis. This increase in margin was partially offset by the impact of introducing our PA-200, which is a lower throughput firewall product. On average, margins for firewall products with lower throughput are less than firewall products with higher throughput. The decrease of 110 basis points in services margin was primarily due to a decrease in average margins on revenue from support and maintenance as a result of an increase in personnel and other costs to support our expanding end-customer base, partially offset by higher margin subscriptions sales, while the mix in services revenue was largely unchanged on a period over period basis.- 46 -Table of ContentsOperating Expenses Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Operating expenses: Research and development$38,570 15.1% $21,366 18.0% $17,204 80.5%Sales and marketing115,917 45.4% 62,254 52.5% 53,663 86.2%General and administrative26,207 10.3% 13,108 11.1% 13,099 99.9%Total operating expenses$180,694 70.8% $96,728 81.6% $83,966 86.8%Includes share-based compensation of: Research and development$3,733 $1,020 $2,713 266.0%Sales and marketing4,267 1,133 3,134 276.6%General and administrative5,151 2,374 2,777 117.0%Total$13,151 $4,527 $8,624 190.5%Research and development expense increased $17.2 million, or 80.5%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $11.6 million as we increased our headcount to support continued investment in our future product and service offerings and an increase in allocated costs and development costs of $4.4 million.Sales and marketing expense increased $53.7 million, or 86.2%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $30.6 million due to an increase in headcount and commissions. Additionally, marketing activity increased $7.1 million related to trade shows and conventions and marketing development programs, travel costs increased $5.0 million, and allocated costs increased $4.6 million. The remaining increase was due to increases in depreciation, facilities costs, and professional services costs. General and administrative expense increased $13.1 million, or 99.9%, for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $6.0 million and an increase in professional services costs of $5.2 million primarily related to overall growth to support the business and infrastructure building in preparation for being a public company. The remaining increase was due to an increase in allocated costs.Other Expense, Net Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Other expense, net$1,110 $1,651 $(541) (32.8)%The change in other expense, net was due to the increase in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. In December 2011 and January 2012, these preferred stock warrants were exercised by the holders. As a result, we issued 197,000 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock and 24,000 shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, all of which converted to common stock at the time of our initial public offering (IPO). The amount for fiscal 2012 represents the change in fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability from the beginning of the period to the dates of exercise of the warrants. We do not expect to incur expenses related to these warrants in future periods. - 47 -Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes Year Ended July 31, 2012 2011 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Provision for income taxes$2,062 $476 $1,586 333.2%Effective tax rate73.7% (3.9)% We incurred tax expense for fiscal 2012, primarily due to foreign taxes, state income taxes, and U.S. federal alternative minimum tax. We have a full valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets. The increase in the provision for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in state income taxes, U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, and foreign taxes as a result of an increase in our taxable income.Liquidity and Capital Resources July 31, 2013 2012 (in thousands)Working capital$323,597 $259,651 Cash and cash equivalents$310,614 $322,642Investments126,321 —Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments$436,935 $322,642 Year Ended July 31,2013 2012 2011 (in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities$114,519 $77,368 $32,102Cash used in investing activities(151,565) (14,565) (13,000)Cash provided by financing activities25,018 219,322 2,580Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(12,028) $282,125 $21,682 At July 31, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents and investments of $436.9 million were held for working capital purposes, of which approximately $27.2 million was held outside the United States and not presently available to fund domestic operations and obligations. If we were to repatriate cash held outside the United States, it could be subject to U.S. income taxes, less any previously paid foreign income taxes. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected. Operating Activities Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs and purchases from our contract manufacturer. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and increases in personnel costs as we grow our business. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012, and fiscal 2011 was $114.5 million, $77.4 million, and $32.1 million, respectively.- 48 -Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2013, operating activities provided $114.5 million in cash as a result of our net loss of $29.2 million, non-cash charges of $49.0 million and a net change of $94.7 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges included share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of investment premiums, net of accretion of purchase discounts, and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation. The net change in our net operating assets and liabilities was due to a $113.4 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increases in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance, a $26.2 million increase in accrued compensation and other liabilities as a result of increases in personnel expense and business activity, and a $5.8 million increase in accounts payable due to payment timing, partially offset by a $41.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales, in particular, increases in sales volume near the end of the period and sales of multi-year subscription and support and maintenance services, and a $8.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. Current deferred revenue increased 78.4% from $86.3 million as of July 31, 2012 to $153.9 million as of July 31, 2013. The increase was due to an increase in business volume during the period. Non-current deferred revenue increased 92.4% from $49.5 million as of July 31, 2012 to $95.3 million as of July 31, 2013. The increase was due to a higher proportion of sales of multi-year subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our day’s sales outstanding, or DSO, defined as the number of days it takes to turn our average quarterly accounts receivable into cash based on a 90 day average, was 72 days for the quarter ended July 31, 2013, which reflected an increase in accounts receivable for the reasons described above.For fiscal 2012, operating activities provided $77.4 million in cash as a result of net income of $0.7 million, non-cash charges of $20.7 million, and a net change of $55.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. The net change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $68.6 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increases in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance, partially offset by a $16.0 million increase in accounts receivable and an $11.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. Our day’s sales outstanding, or DSO, defined as the number of days it takes to turn our average quarterly accounts receivable into cash based on a 90 day average, was 50 days for the quarter ended July 31, 2012.For fiscal 2011, operating activities provided $32.1 million in cash, primarily as a result of a net loss of $12.5 million, offset by non-cash charges of $8.5 million as well as a net change of $36.1 million in our net operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges included share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a $43.1 million increase in deferred revenue as a result of increases in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance and a $9.1 million increase in accrued compensation and other liabilities primarily due to deferred rent related to moving our headquarters from Sunnyvale, California to Santa Clara, California. These increases were partially offset by a $15.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales and a $5.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of growth in our business. Our DSO was 57 days for the quarter ended July 31, 2011. Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of purchases of property, equipment, and other assets and purchases, sales, and maturities of investments. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows. For fiscal 2013, cash used in investing activities was $151.6 million, as a result of $345.3 million in purchases of short-term and long-term investments to shift the mix of investments from money market funds to higher yield corporate notes and bonds and U.S. government agency securities, and capital expenditures to purchase property, equipment, and other assets of $22.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $216.2 million. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2012 and 2011, was $14.6 million and $13.0 million, respectively, and was primarily the result of capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment, including $7.0 million for fiscal 2012 related to purchases of demonstration units for use by our customers in evaluating our products and services and capitalized internally developed software costs related to the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system and $7.3 million for fiscal 2011 related to moving our headquarters from Sunnyvale, California to Santa Clara, California.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our IPO proceeds from the exercises of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. For fiscal 2013, financing activities provided $25.0 million in cash, as a result of proceeds from the exercises of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of $21.0 million and excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $6.8 million, partially offset by payments of costs related to our IPO of $2.7 million. - 49 -Table of Contents For fiscal 2012, financing activities provided $219.3 million in cash as a result of net proceeds to us from our IPO and the exercises of stock options. On July 25, 2012, we completed our IPO, in which 7,130,000 shares of common stock were sold to the public (inclusive of 5,617,000 shares of common stock sold by us). The public offering price of the shares sold in the IPO was $42.00 per share. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, offering expenses payable by us, and net proceeds received by the selling stockholders, the aggregate net proceeds received by us totaled approximately $215.4 million. For fiscal 2011, financing activities provided $2.6 million in cash as a result of proceeds from the exercises of stock options.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2013: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3- 5 Years More Than 5 Years (in thousands) Operating lease obligations(1) (2) $108,313 $7,728 $24,634 $23,651 $52,300Purchase obligations(3) 19,130 19,130 — — —Total(4) $127,443 $26,858 $24,634 $23,651 $52,300 ______________(1)Consists of contractual obligations from non-cancelable office space under operating leases.

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(4)No amounts related to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740-10, Income Taxes, are included. As of July 31, 2013, we had approximately $2.4 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through July 31, 2013, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from the sales of hardware and software products, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services primarily through a direct sales force and indirect relationships with channel partners, and, to a lesser extent, directly to end-customers.Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:- 50 -Table of Contents•Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. We rely upon non-cancelable sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has Occurred. We use shipping documents or transmissions of product or service contract registration codes to determine delivery.•The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction.•Collectability is Reasonably Assured. We assess collectability based on credit analysis and payment history.We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us. In addition, payment from our partners is not contingent on the partner’s success in sales to end-customers. Our partners generally do not stock appliances and only have limited stock rotation rights and no price protection rights. When necessary, we make certain estimates and maintain allowances for sales returns and other programs based on our historical experience. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and management’s judgment. If actual results deviate significantly from our estimates, our revenue could be adversely affected. We recognize services revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance ratably over the contractual service period, which is typically one to five years. Other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and has not been significant to date.Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support and maintenance, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services. Products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables typically include proprietary operating system software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price (BESP), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting using the relative estimated selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting any specified performance conditions.To determine the estimated selling price in multiple-element arrangements, we establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If VSOE of selling price cannot be established for a deliverable, we establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality from our competitors, we are unable to obtain comparable pricing of our competitors’ products with similar functionality on a standalone basis. Therefore, we have not been able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price can be established for a deliverable, we establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing. Historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), offering type (products or services), and whether or not the opportunity was identified by our sales force or by our partners. In analyzing historical transaction pricing, we evaluate whether a majority of the prices charged for a product or service, as represented by a percentage of list price, fall within a reasonable range. To further support the best estimate of selling price as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and our revenue could be adversely affected.In multiple-element arrangements where software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned estimated selling price hierarchy. The arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when VSOE of fair value of the undelivered items exists. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements. In determining VSOE of fair value, we evaluate whether a substantial majority of the historical prices charged for a product or service sold on a standalone basis, as represented by a percentage of list price, fall within a reasonably narrow range. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and - 51 -Table of Contentsrecognized at the earlier of: (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless support and maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual service period.Share-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee and non-employee director awards, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. The fair value of option awards and purchases under our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2012 ESPP) is estimated on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized using a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. We estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures.The fair value of options and shares sold through our 2012 ESPP is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our option-pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and other subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.In addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense for our awards. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements.We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax liability as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.- 52 -Table of ContentsEstimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans. Assumptions represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. Should actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted.Contract Manufacturer LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer and payments to it are a significant portion of our product cost of revenues. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage our relationship with our independent contract manufacturer, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products, we generally do not own the manufactured products. Product title transfers from our independent contract manufacturer to us and immediately to our partners upon shipment. Our independent contract manufacturer assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturer, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure. Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are vigorously defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. Refer to the discussion under “Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation” in Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to pending litigation.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsWe evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether or not the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset. Through July 31, 2013, our impairment write-down of long-lived assets was not material.WarrantiesWe generally provide a one-year warranty on hardware and a three-month warranty on software. We are indemnified by our contract manufacturer for product liability claims arising out of manufacturing defects. We accrue for potential warranty claims as a component of cost of product revenues based on historical experience and other data. Accrued warranty is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is reviewed periodically for adequacy. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin could be adversely affected. To date, we have not accrued any significant costs associated with our warranty.- 53 -Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. - 54 -Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound, and Japanese Yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2013 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions. As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2013 would not have been material to our financial statements assuming consistent investment levels. - 55 -",2023-12-30 20:21:28.045514

Our enterprise security platform consists of three major elements: our Next-Generation Firewall, our Advanced Endpoint Protection, and our Threat Intelligence Cloud. Our Next-Generation Firewall delivers application, user, and content visibility and control as well as protection against network based cyber threats integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture. Our Advanced Endpoint Protection, which we expect to release in fiscal 2015, prevents cyber attacks that aim to exploit software vulnerabilities on a broad variety of fixed and virtual endpoints. Our Threat Intelligence Cloud provides central intelligence capabilities as well as automated delivery of preventative measures against cyber attacks. The cloud-based element of our platform is delivered in the form of a service that can be used either in the public cloud or in a private cloud using a dedicated appliance. We derive revenue from sales of our products and services, which together comprise our platform. Product revenue is generated from sales of our Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in hardware and virtualized form factors. Our Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. These capabilities include: application visibility and control (App-ID), user identification (User-ID), site-to-site virtual private network (VPN), remote access Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN, and Quality-of-Service (QoS). Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from the PA-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to the PA-7050, which is designed for data centers and high-speed networks. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in the hardware appliances is also available in the VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments. Multiple firewalls can jointly use our WildFire appliance, WF-500, which identifies, analyzes, and blocks known and unknown malware in a private cloud-based environment. Our platform can be centrally managed in both virtualized and hardware appliances across an organization with our Panorama product. In addition, our GlobalProtect appliance, GP-100, provides mobile device management, malware detection, and shares device state information to safely enable mobile devices for business use.- 40 -Table of ContentsServices revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, GlobalProtect, and WildFire subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices. Our Advanced Endpoint Protection, which we expect to release in fiscal 2015, protects against cyber attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities in Windows-based fixed and virtual endpoints through the use of its unique capability of stopping the underlying exploit techniques, and can prevent cyber attacks without relying on prior knowledge of the attack. When end-customers purchase an appliance, they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality, as well as support and maintenance in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. We leverage our appliances to sell software as a service (SaaS) subscription services to meet our customers’ evolving enterprise security requirements. Our hybrid SaaS revenue model consists of product, subscriptions, and support and maintenance, which will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. Sales of these services increase our deferred revenue balance and contribute significantly to our positive cash flow provided by operating activities.We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our global distributor channel partners, which, in turn, sell our products and services to our reseller network, which then sell to our end-customers. Our channel partners purchase our products and services at a discount to our list prices before reselling them to our end-customers. Our channel partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us and generally do not stock appliances.We continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in several new product offerings during fiscal 2014. These new product offerings include: the PA-7050 firewall with a throughput of 120Mbps; the GP-100 mobile security management appliance, which offers an easy to deploy, high-performance, dedicated management appliance for our GlobalProtect customers; and the VM-1000-HV virtual Next-Generation Firewall, which is fully integrated with VMware's NSX virtualization platform.In addition, we extended our enterprise security platform and our technology leadership with the acquisitions of Cyvera Ltd. (“Cyvera”) and Morta Security, Inc. (“Morta”). Cyvera's endpoint software protects enterprises from cyber threats by using an innovative approach to block unknown, zero-day attacks on the endpoint. We intend to invest approximately $25.0 million in fiscal 2015 in research and development, customer support, and growing our Advanced Endpoint Protection sales force. We anticipate billings (non-GAAP) and revenue of our Advanced Endpoint Protection will begin ramping in the second half of fiscal 2015 with a more meaningful revenue contribution in fiscal 2016. Morta provides a team of cybersecurity experts that will enhance our WildFire threat prevention offering. These enhancements enable quick discovery and elimination of previously unknown malware, zero-day exploits, and advanced persistent threats.In May 2014, we entered into a Settlement, Release and Cross-License Agreement (the “settlement agreement”) with Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper”). Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to pay Juniper $75.0 million in cash, transfer 1.1 million shares of our common stock, and issue a warrant to purchase 0.5 million shares of our common stock. The terms of the settlement agreement provide for mutual dismissal with prejudice of all pending litigation between the parties, cross-license of the patents in suit for the life of the patents, and an eight-year mutual covenant not to sue for infringement of any other patents. The settlement with Juniper resolves all pending litigation matters between us and will allow us to further focus on innovating and strengthening our product portfolio, servicing our customers, and growing our business. For fiscal 2014, we added more than 5,300 new customers, including some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We had more than 19,000 end-customers in over 130 countries as of July 31, 2014. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications. As of July 31, 2014, we had 1,722 employees. For fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, revenues were $598.2 million, $396.1 million, and $255.1 million, respectively, representing year over year growth of 51.0% for fiscal 2014 and 55.3% for fiscal 2013, despite continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.All three components of our hybrid SaaS revenue model experienced year over year growth, led by revenue from subscription services, which grew 73.1% to $123.2 million, followed by support and maintenance services, which grew 66.0% to $134.8 million, and product, which grew 39.6% to $340.1 million. The growth reflected increasing recurring revenue in our business model and rapid adoption of high margin subscription services in our base of end-customers.In June 2014, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.0% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the ""Notes""). The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting fees and offering expenses of $15.4 million, were approximately $559.6 million. In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 5.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $110.28 per share. In addition, concurrent with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, we entered into separate warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to acquire approximately 5.2 million shares of our common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $137.85 per share. We used approximately $32.7 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge - 41 -Table of Contentstransactions (after such cost was partially offset by the proceeds from the warrant transactions). Refer to Note 7. Convertible Senior Notes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to the Notes. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $974.4 million as of July 31, 2014.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and services within existing end-customers, extend the length of service terms within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products, as well as effectively hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected.Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “—Financial Overview” and “—Results of Operations.” The following tables summarize deferred revenue, cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow (non-GAAP), and billings (non-GAAP).

(4)Includes acquisition transaction costs of $4.4 million, nil, and nil for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.(5)Includes amortization of Juniper intellectual property licenses of $2.0 million, nil, and nil for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.- 42 -Table of Contents(6)Includes our cash payments of $75.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 for the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively.•Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support and maintenance revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and support and maintenance services. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the purchases of property, equipment, and other assets, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands)Cash Flow: Cash flow provided by operating activities$88,406 $114,519 $77,368Less: purchase of property, equipment, and other assets36,107 22,442 14,565Free cash flow (non-GAAP)(1)$52,299 $92,077 $62,803Net cash used in investing activities$(320,348) $(151,565) $(14,565)Net cash provided by financing activities$575,140 $25,018 $219,322______________(1)Includes our cash payments of $75.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 for the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively.•Billings (non-GAAP). We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. Billings is a key measure used by our management to manage our business because billings drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly as we experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscriptions and support and maintenance services, and monitor our near term cash flows. We believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:- 43 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands)Billings (non-GAAP): Total revenue$598,179 $396,107 $255,138Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue173,196 113,422 68,553Billings (non-GAAP)$771,375 $509,529 $323,691Financial OverviewRevenueWe derive revenue from sales of our products and services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.Our total revenue is comprised of the following:•Product Revenue. The substantial majority of our product revenue is derived from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, Virtual Systems Upgrades, and the VM-Series. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.•Services Revenue. Services revenue is derived primarily from Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, GlobalProtect, and WildFire subscriptions and support and maintenance. We expect to release our Advanced Endpoint Protection in fiscal 2015. We anticipate revenue from our Advanced Endpoint Protection will begin ramping in the second half of fiscal 2015 with a more meaningful revenue contribution in fiscal 2016. Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, GlobalProtect, and WildFire subscriptions are priced as a percentage of the appliance’s list price. Our contractual subscription and support and maintenance terms are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing services contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.Cost of Revenue Our total cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of services revenue. Our cost of revenue includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer and personnel costs, which consist of salaries, bonuses, and share-based compensation associated with our operations and global customer support organizations. Our cost of revenue also includes allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount, and amortization of intangible assets.•Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer. Our cost of product revenue also includes amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, allocated costs, warranty costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases.•Cost of Services Revenue. Cost of services revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support organization, amortization of intangible assets acquired, allocated costs, and URL filtering database service fees. We expect our cost of services revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between products and services. For sales of our products, our higher throughput firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower throughput firewall products within each product series. For sales of our services, our subscriptions typically have higher gross margins than our support and maintenance. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.- 44 -Table of ContentsOperating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expense, and legal settlement expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars, and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2014, we expect to recognize approximately $320.8 million of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of three years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. •Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.•Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs including commission costs. We expense commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to increase the size of our sales force and have also substantially grown our sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.•General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, professional services, and certain non-recurring general expenses. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and IT organizations. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, and investor relations, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. •Legal Settlement. Legal settlement expense consists of charges related to the settlement agreement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet”). Refer to the discussion under Note 9. Legal Settlement of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to these matters.Interest ExpenseInterest expense consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the Notes. We expect interest expense to increase over the term of the Notes. Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of the warrant issued to Juniper, which was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value from the date of issuance through the date of exercise with the corresponding change recorded as other expense. Other income (expense), net also includes interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, foreign currency re-measurement gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, withholding taxes, and federal and state income taxes in the United States. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We implemented our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Income in certain countries may be taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. As a result, our overall effective tax rate over the long term may be lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate on positive income through changes in international procurement and sales operations.Results of Operations The following tables summarize our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods.

The increase was driven by increased demand for our higher end appliances. The impact of changes in pricing on our product revenue was insignificant. Services revenue increased $105.6 million, or 69.3%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was driven by a 73.1% increase in our subscription revenue and a 66.0% increase in our support and maintenance revenue due to increased sales to new and existing end-customers. The relative increases in subscriptions and support and maintenance revenue will fluctuate over time, depending on the mix of services revenue and the introduction of new subscription offerings. The impact of changes in pricing on our services revenue was insignificant. With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the increase in revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific and Japan (APAC) increased during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.

Product cost for fiscal 2014 includes $2.0 million of amortization related to Juniper intellectual property licenses.Service cost increased $27.8 million, or 59.9%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an increase in personnel costs of $14.8 million related to increasing our headcount, allocated costs of $5.5 million, professional services costs of $2.1 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.6 million, and other costs incurred to expand our customer service capabilities to support our growing installed end-customer base. Gross margin increased 100 basis points for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase of 90 basis points in product margin was due to continued focus on material cost reductions, partially offset by $2.0 million of amortization related to Juniper intellectual property licenses. The increase of 170 basis points in services margin was due to contributions from our higher margin subscription services.Operating Expenses Year Ended July 31, 2014 2013 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Operating expenses: Research and development$104,813 17.5% $62,482 15.8% $42,331 67.7%Sales and marketing334,763 56.0% 199,771 50.4% 134,992 67.6%General and administrative73,149 12.2% 42,719 10.8% 30,430 71.2%Legal settlement141,173 23.6% — —% 141,173 N/ATotal operating expenses$653,898 109.3% $304,972 77.0% $348,926 114.4%Includes share-based compensation of: Research and development$29,524 $9,931 $19,593 197.3%Sales and marketing42,647 20,493 22,154 108.1%General and administrative16,668 9,101 7,567 83.1%Total$88,839 $39,525 $49,314 124.8%Research and development expense increased $42.3 million, or 67.7%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an increase in personnel costs of $31.4 million largely due to an increase in headcount, an increase in allocated costs of $6.4 million, and an increase in development costs of $2.5 million to support continued investment in our future product and service offerings.Sales and marketing expense increased $135.0 million, or 67.6%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an increase in personnel costs of $94.6 million largely due to an increase in sales commissions and headcount, an increase in allocated costs of $13.9 million, an increase in travel and entertainment costs of $8.9 million, an increase in professional services costs of $7.6 million, and an increase in demand generation activities, trade shows, and other marketing activities of $6.1 million.General and administrative expense increased $30.4 million, or 71.2%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an increase in professional services costs of $12.5 million, including expenses related to the intellectual property litigation with Juniper of $7.7 million and expenses related to our acquisitions of Cyvera and Morta of $4.4 million, an increase in personnel costs of $12.3 million, largely due to an increase in headcount, and an increase of allocated costs of $2.4 million.Legal settlement expense increased $141.2 million for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to the recognition of an expense of $121.2 million and $20.0 million for the settlement agreement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively.- 49 -Table of ContentsInterest Expense Year Ended July 31, 2014 2013 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Interest expense$1,883 $74 $1,809 2,444.6%Interest expense increased $1.8 million for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the Notes.

The provision for income taxes decreased $6.3 million for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to decreased U.S. taxable income, primarily attributable to the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet.- 50 -Table of ContentsComparison of Fiscal 2013 and 2012 Revenue Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Revenue: Product$243,707 61.5% $174,462 68.4% $69,245 39.7%Services Subscription71,203 18.0% 38,698 15.2% 32,505 84.0%Support and maintenance81,197 20.5% 41,978 16.4% 39,219 93.4%Total services152,400 38.5% 80,676 31.6% 71,724 88.9%Total revenue$396,107 100.0% $255,138 100.0% $140,969 55.3%Revenue by geographic theater: Americas$247,616 62.5% $161,873 63.4% $85,743 53.0%EMEA91,496 23.1% 61,994 24.3% 29,502 47.6%APAC56,995 14.4% 31,271 12.3% 25,724 82.3%Total revenue$396,107 100.0% $255,138 100.0% $140,969 55.3%Product revenue increased $69.2 million, or 39.7%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Approximately two-thirds of the increase was driven by our newly introduced PA-3000 Series firewalls and M-100 management appliance. The remaining increase was driven by a greater than 50% increase in product unit volume attributable to sales of our PA-5000 Series and PA-200 firewalls.Service revenue increased $71.7 million, or 88.9%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012. Approximately half of the increase was related to support and maintenance as a result of an increase in total end-customers to more than 13,500 at July 31, 2013 from more than 9,000 at July 31, 2012. The remaining increase was due to an increase in subscriptions from new and existing end-customers.With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the increase in revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin (dollars in thousands)Cost of revenue: Product$63,412 $44,615 $18,797 Services46,344 25,938 20,406 Total cost of revenue$109,756 $70,553 $39,203 Gross profit: Product$180,295 74.0% $129,847 74.4% $50,448 (0.4)%Services106,056 69.6% 54,738 67.8% 51,318 1.8 %Total gross profit$286,351 72.3% $184,585 72.3% $101,766 — %- 51 -Table of ContentsProduct cost increased $18.8 million, or 42.1%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in product unit volume, including sales of our newly introduced PA-3000 Series firewalls and M-100 management appliance. Service cost increased $20.4 million, or 78.7%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in personnel costs of $9.5 million, including share-based compensation of $2.9 million. The remaining increase was attributable to other costs incurred to expand our customer service capabilities to support our growing installed end-customer base. Gross margin for fiscal 2013 remained consistent with fiscal 2012. The decrease of 40 basis points in product margin was due to an 80 basis point decrease as a result of the introduction of our PA-3000 Series firewalls, WF-500 appliance and our M-100 management appliance, which will have lower product margins until volume and related cost savings increase, partially offset by decreases in manufacturing costs for other appliances. The increase of 180 basis points in services margin was due to an increase in subscription, support and maintenance without a proportionate increase in our global customer service organization costs. The mix in services revenue was largely unchanged on a period over period basis.Operating Expenses Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount % ofRevenue Amount % ofRevenue Amount % (dollars in thousands)Operating expenses: Research and development$62,482 15.8% $38,570 15.1% $23,912 62.0%Sales and marketing199,771 50.4% 115,917 45.4% 83,854 72.3%General and administrative42,719 10.8% 26,207 10.3% 16,512 63.0%Total operating expenses$304,972 77.0% $180,694 70.8% $124,278 68.8%Includes share-based compensation of: Research and development$9,931 $3,733 $6,198 166.0%Sales and marketing20,493 4,267 16,226 380.3%General and administrative9,101 5,151 3,950 76.7%Total$39,525 $13,151 $26,374 200.5%Research and development expense increased $23.9 million, or 62.0%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in personnel costs of $16.1 million related to increasing our headcount and share-based compensation, an increase in allocated costs of $3.7 million, and an increase in development costs of $2.8 million to support continued investment in our future product and service offerings.Sales and marketing expense increased $83.9 million, or 72.3%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in personnel costs of $58.0 million largely due to an increase in headcount, share-based compensation, and commission costs, an increase in allocated costs of $10.7 million, and an increase in marketing activity of $5.6 million related to demand generation activities, trade shows, and other marketing activities. The remaining increase was due to an increase in travel and entertainment costs of $5.6 million, professional service costs of $2.0 million, and office equipment and software costs of $1.9 million in support of our sales efforts.General and administrative expense increased $16.5 million, or 63.0%, for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to an increase in professional services costs of $6.9 million, including expenses related to IP litigation with Juniper of $3.6 million. The remaining increase was due to an increase in personnel costs of $6.6 million, and an increase in allocated costs of $2.3 million related to overall growth to support the business and building our infrastructure to meet the regulatory requirements of being a public company. - 52 -Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), Net Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Other income (expense), net$39 $(1,056) $1,095 NMOther income (expense), net consisted primarily of foreign currency remeasurement losses for fiscal 2013 and the change in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability for fiscal 2012. The increase in other income (expense), net was due to the elimination of the expense related to our preferred stock warrant liability as a result of exercise of these warrants by the holders in December 2011 and January 2012, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency remeasurement loss.Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended July 31, 2013 2012 Change Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Provision for income taxes$10,590 $2,062 $8,528 413.6%Effective tax rate(56.8)% 73.7% We recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2013 due to U.S. federal income taxes, state income taxes, foreign income taxes, and foreign withholding taxes. We have a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets. The provision for income taxes increased for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to a significant increase in domestic taxable income after full utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, our global operations and foreign presence expanded year over year giving rise to additional foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.Liquidity and Capital Resources July 31, 2014 2013 (in thousands)Working capital$610,155 $323,597Cash, cash equivalents, and investments: Cash and cash equivalents$653,812 $310,614Investments320,570 126,321Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments$974,382 $436,935At July 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents and investments of $974.4 million were held for working capital purposes, of which approximately $101.5 million was held outside the United States. Our current plans do not include repatriating these funds. However, if these funds were needed for our domestic operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. There are no other restrictions on the use of these funds. We do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, all of which we expect to reinvest outside of the United States indefinitely. If we were to repatriate these earnings to the United States, any associated income tax liability would be insignificant.In June 2014, we issued the Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The Notes will mature on July 1, 2019. Prior to January 1, 2019, holders may surrender their Notes for early conversion under certain circumstances. Refer to Note 7. Convertible Senior Notes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the specific circumstances. Upon conversion of the Notes, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and we may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with respect to the remainder of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. As of July 31, 2014, the Notes were not convertible.- 53 -Table of ContentsThe net proceeds from the offering, after deducting fees and offering expenses of $15.4 million, were approximately $559.6 million. In connection with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to 5.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $110.28 per share. In addition, concurrent with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, we entered into separate warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to acquire approximately 5.2 million shares of our common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $137.85 per share. We used approximately $32.7 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions (after such cost was partially offset by the proceeds from the warrant transactions). The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, and strategic transactions. The following table summarizes cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. Year Ended July 31,2014 2013 2012 (in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities$88,406 $114,519 $77,368Cash used in investing activities(320,348) (151,565) (14,565)Cash provided by financing activities575,140 25,018 219,322Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$343,198 $(12,028) $282,125We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In addition, we may be required to pay additional taxes related to the acquisition of Cyvera if we transfer the acquired intellectual property out of Israel. We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $88.4 million, $114.5 million, and $77.4 million, respectively.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was $88.4 million, a decrease of $26.1 million compared to fiscal 2013 due to payments of $75.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 for the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 was $114.5 million, an increase of $37.2 million compared to fiscal 2012 due to changes in our assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in our net loss in fiscal 2013. Our net loss for fiscal 2013 increased due to an increase in share-based compensation expense. Changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 include an increase in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures and net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $320.3 million, an increase of $168.8 million as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due to net cash payments of $85.7 million for business acquisitions, an increase of $69.4 million in net purchases of available-for-sale investments, and an increase of $13.7 million in purchases of property, equipment, and other assets.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2013 was $151.6 million, an increase of $137.0 million as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily due to net purchases of short-term and long-term investments of $129.1 million and an increase of $7.9 million in purchases of property, equipment, and other assets.- 54 -Table of ContentsFinancing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, proceeds from sale of our common stock in our initial public offering, and proceeds from the exercises of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan. Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 was $575.1 million, an increase of $550.1 million as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due to net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $527.7 million. The remaining increase was due to higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans during fiscal 2014 and the last payments of our initial public offering costs in fiscal 2013.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013 was $25.0 million, a decrease of $194.3 million as compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease was due to proceeds of $215.4 million from our initial public offering during fiscal 2012. The decrease was partially offset by higher proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan during fiscal 2013.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2014: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3- 5 Years More Than 5 Years (in thousands) 0.0% convertible senior notes due 2019$575,000 $— $— $575,000 $—Operating lease obligations(1) (2) 105,710 14,170 27,466 21,471 42,603Purchase obligations(3)29,895 29,895 — — —Total(4)$710,605 $44,065 $27,466 $596,471 $42,603______________(1)Consists of contractual obligations from non-cancelable office space under operating leases.

(3)Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our independent contract manufacturer and original design manufacturers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(4)No amounts related to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740-10, Income Taxes, are included. As of July 31, 2014, we had approximately $4.5 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough July 31, 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue Recognition- 55 -Table of ContentsWe generate revenue from the sales of hardware and software products, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services primarily through a direct sales force and indirect relationships with channel partners, and, to a lesser extent, directly to end-customers.Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:•Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. We rely upon non-cancelable sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has Occurred. We use shipping documents or transmissions of product or service contract registration codes to determine delivery.•The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction.•Collectability is Reasonably Assured. We assess collectability based on credit analysis and payment history.We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our partners generally receive an order from an end-customer prior to placing an order with us. In addition, payment from our partners is not contingent on the partner’s success in sales to end-customers. Our partners generally do not stock appliances and only have limited stock rotation rights and no price protection rights. When necessary, we make certain estimates and maintain allowances for sales returns and other programs based on our historical experience. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and management’s judgment. If actual results deviate significantly from our estimates, our revenue could be adversely affected. We recognize services revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance ratably over the contractual service period, which is typically one to five years. Other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and has not been significant to date.Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support and maintenance, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services. Products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables typically include proprietary operating system software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if available, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price (BESP), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available. The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting using the relative estimated selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting any specified performance conditions.To determine the estimated selling price in multiple-element arrangements, we establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If VSOE of selling price cannot be established for a deliverable, we establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality from our competitors, we are unable to obtain comparable pricing of our competitors’ products with similar functionality on a standalone basis. Therefore, we have not been able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price can be established for a deliverable, we establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing. Historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), offering type (products or services), and whether or not the opportunity was identified by our sales force or by our partners. In analyzing historical transaction pricing, we evaluate whether a majority of the prices charged for a product or service, as represented by a percentage of list price, fall within a reasonable range. To further support the best estimate of selling price as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and our revenue could be adversely affected.In multiple-element arrangements where software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned estimated selling price hierarchy. The arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when VSOE of fair value of the undelivered items exists. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered - 56 -Table of Contentselements. In determining VSOE of fair value, we evaluate whether a substantial majority of the historical prices charged for a product or service sold on a standalone basis, as represented by a percentage of list price, fall within a reasonably narrow range. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of: (i) delivery of those elements or (ii) when fair value can be established unless support and maintenance is the only undelivered element, in which case, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual service period.Share-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to share-based transactions is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. The fair value of option awards and purchases under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) and 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2012 ESPP”) is estimated on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized using a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. We estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures.The fair value of options and shares sold through our 2012 Plan and 2012 ESPP is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our option-pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.In addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share-based compensation expense for our awards. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share-based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements.We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final - 57 -Table of Contentstax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Contract Manufacturer LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer and payments to it are a significant portion of our product cost of revenues. We have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage our relationship with our independent contract manufacturer, manage our supply chain, and monitor product testing and quality. Although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products, we generally do not own the manufactured products. Product title transfers from our independent contract manufacturer to us and immediately to our partners upon shipment. Our independent contract manufacturer assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. If the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast, which may be caused by factors outside of our control, we accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturer, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure. Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. We are vigorously defending our current litigation matters. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. Refer to the discussion under “Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation” in Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to pending litigation.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We first analyze qualitative factors, which include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative analysis required under the two-step goodwill impairment test.Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, we first compare the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, operating trends, risk-adjusted discount rates, future - 58 -Table of Contentseconomic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.To date, we have not recognized any impairment losses on our goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.- 59 -Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound, and Japanese Yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2014 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions. As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2014 would not have been material to our financial statements assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2014, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.0% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the “Notes”). We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet. As this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of the Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 60 -",2023-12-30 20:21:29.558990

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is organized as follows:•Overview. A discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A.•Key Financial Metrics. A summary of our GAAP and non-GAAP key financial metrics, which management monitors to evaluate our performance.•Results of Operations. A discussion of the nature and trends of the components of our financial results and an analysis of our financial results comparing fiscal 2015 to 2014 and fiscal 2014 to 2013.•Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and a discussion of our financial condition and our ability to meet cash needs.•Contractual Obligations and Commitments. An overview of our contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements outstanding as of July 31, 2015, including expected payment schedule.•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. A discussion of accounting policies that require critical estimates, assumptions, and judgments.•Recent Accounting Pronouncements. A discussion of expected impacts of impending accounting changes on financial information to be reported in the future.- 38 -Table of ContentsOverview We have pioneered the next-generation of security with our innovative platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on their networks and by preventing breaches in real-time that stem from targeted cyber attacks. Our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content. As a result, it provides in-depth visibility into all traffic and all applications, at the user level, at all times, and at the full speed of the network in order to control usage, content, risks, and cyber threats. Our security platform consists of three major elements: our Next-Generation Firewall, our Advanced Endpoint Protection, and our Threat Intelligence Cloud. Our Next-Generation Firewall delivers application, user, and content visibility and control as well as protection against network-based cyber threats integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture. Our Advanced Endpoint Protection prevents cyber attacks that aim to exploit software vulnerabilities on a broad variety of fixed and virtual endpoints and servers. Our Threat Intelligence Cloud provides central intelligence capabilities, security for SaaS applications, and automated delivery of preventative measures against cyber attacks.The network-based element of our platform is delivered in the form of a physical or virtual appliance and includes a suite of subscription services. The cyber attack prevention capabilities of our platform are delivered in the form of subscription services that can be used either in the public cloud or in a private cloud using a dedicated appliance. Our subscription services can be easily activated on any of our appliances without requiring additional hardware or processing resources, thereby providing a seamless implementation path for our end-customers.For fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, revenues were $928.1 million, $598.2 million, and $396.1 million, respectively, representing year over year growth of 55.1% for fiscal 2015 and 51.0% for fiscal 2014. All three components of our hybrid SaaS revenue model experienced year over year growth, led by revenue from subscription services, which grew 72.6% to $212.7 million, followed by support and maintenance services, which grew 65.2% to $222.7 million, and product, which grew 44.8% to $492.7 million.Our growth reflects the rapid adoption of our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support and maintenance. We believe this model will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. Our growth was also driven by increased security spending by customers, as security continues to be a critical business imperative for every business in the world. As of July 31, 2015, we had sold our products and services to more than 26,000 end-customers in over 140 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world.Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in physical and virtualized form. Our Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from the PA-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to the PA-7080, which is especially suited for service provider customers. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments.Services revenue is generated from sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance, which together provide us with a source of recurring services revenue. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices.We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our global distributor channel partners, which, in turn, sell our products and services to our reseller network, which then sell to our end-customers. We leverage our appliances to sell SaaS subscription services to meet our customers’ evolving security requirements. When end-customers purchase an appliance, they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality, as well as support and maintenance in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs.We continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio, which resulted in several new product offerings and announcements during fiscal 2015. These new product offerings include: Traps, our Advanced Endpoint Protection service; the PA-3060 appliance, which is aimed at mid-sized datacenters; the M-500 management appliance, which is aimed at data centers and large enterprise deployments; and the AutoFocus cyber threat intelligence service, which provides prioritized actionable intelligence on targeted cyber attacks and is expected to be generally available in fiscal 2016. In August 2015, we announced the launch of the PA-7080 appliance, which is our top-of-the-line chassis-based appliance ideally suited for service provider customers. Additionally, in May 2015, we acquired CirroSecure, which expands the functionality of our platform by providing additional security for SaaS applications. The CirroSecure technology will be the foundation for a new subscription service called Aperture, which we expect to launch in fiscal 2016.- 39 -Table of ContentsWe believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and services within existing end-customers, extend the length of service terms within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results.To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Additionally, we face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products, as well as effectively hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management. If we are unable to successfully address these challenges, our business, operating results, and prospects could be adversely affected.Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “—Financial Overview” and “—Results of Operations.” The following tables summarize deferred revenue, cash flow provided by operating activities, free cash flow (non-GAAP), and billings (non-GAAP). July 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands)Total deferred revenue $713,654 $422,578Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$1,327,820 $974,382 Year Ended July 31, 2015 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands)Total revenue$928,052 $598,179 $396,107Year over year percentage increase55.1 % 51.0 % 55.3 %Gross margin percentage72.9 % 73.3 % 72.3 %Operating loss$(133,536) $(215,347) $(18,621)Operating margin percentage(14.4)% (36.0)% (4.7)%Billings (non-GAAP)$1,219,128 $771,375 $509,529Cash flow provided by operating activities$350,304 $88,406 $114,519Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$316,476 $52,299 $92,077•Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced, but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support and maintenance revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and support and maintenance services. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the purchases of property, equipment, and other productive assets, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. - 40 -Table of ContentsA limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in thousands)Free cash flow (non-GAAP): Cash flow provided by operating activities$350,304 $88,406 $114,519Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets33,828 36,107 22,442Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (1)$316,476 $52,299 $92,077Net cash used in investing activities$(679,006) $(320,348) $(151,565)Net cash provided by financing activities$50,704 $575,140 $25,018______________(1)Includes our cash payments of $75.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 for the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively.•Billings (non-GAAP). We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. Billings is a key measure used by our management to manage our business because billings drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly as we experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscriptions and support and maintenance services, and monitor our near term cash flows. We believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of billings to revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in thousands)Billings (non-GAAP): Total revenue$928,052 $598,179 $396,107Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue291,076 173,196 113,422Billings (non-GAAP)$1,219,128 $771,375 $509,529- 41 -Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following tables summarize our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods.

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.Our total revenue is comprised of the following:•Product Revenue. Product revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, GlobalProtect, and the VM-Series. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.•Services Revenue. Services revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our contractual subscription and support and maintenance terms are typically one year, although we also offer three to five year terms. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing services contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.- 42 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Revenue: Product$492,658 $340,143 $152,515 44.8% $340,143 $243,707 $96,436 39.6%Services Subscription212,676 123,236 89,440 72.6% 123,236 71,203 52,033 73.1%Support and maintenance222,718 134,800 87,918 65.2% 134,800 81,197 53,603 66.0%Total services435,394 258,036 177,358 68.7% 258,036 152,400 105,636 69.3%Total revenue$928,052 $598,179 $329,873 55.1% $598,179 $396,107 $202,072 51.0%Revenue by geographic theater: Americas$639,328 $396,626 $242,702 61.2% $396,626 $247,616 $149,010 60.2%EMEA178,719 126,915 51,804 40.8% 126,915 91,496 35,419 38.7%APAC110,005 74,638 35,367 47.4% 74,638 56,995 17,643 31.0%Total revenue$928,052 $598,179 $329,873 55.1% $598,179 $396,107 $202,072 51.0%Product revenue increased $152.5 million, or 44.8%, for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and increased $96.4 million, or 39.6%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increases in both periods were driven by increased demand for our higher end appliances. The impact of changes in pricing on our product revenue was insignificant.Services revenue increased $177.4 million, or 68.7%, for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and increased $105.6 million, or 69.3%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increases in both periods were due to increased sales to new and existing end-customers. The relative increases in subscription revenue and support and maintenance revenue will fluctuate over time, depending on the mix of services revenue and the introduction of new subscription offerings. The impact of changes in pricing on our services revenue was insignificant.With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year over year increases in revenue for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased year over year for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of services revenue. Our cost of revenue includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer and personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and share-based compensation associated with our operations, global customer support, and technical operations organizations. Our cost of revenue also includes allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount, as well as amortization of intellectual property licenses and intangible assets.•Cost of Product Revenue. Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer. Our cost of product revenue also includes amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, allocated costs, warranty costs, shipping costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases.•Cost of Services Revenue. Cost of services revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, amortization of acquired intangible assets, allocated costs, and URL filtering database service fees. We expect our cost of services revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows.- 43 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in thousands)Cost of revenue: Product$131,094 $85,503 $45,591 53.3% $85,503 $63,412 $22,091 34.8%Services120,405 74,125 46,280 62.4% 74,125 46,344 27,781 59.9%Total cost of revenue$251,499 $159,628 $91,871 57.6% $159,628 $109,756 $49,872 45.4%Includes share-based compensation of: Product$3,858 $1,636 $2,222 135.8% $1,636 $765 $871 113.9%Services20,425 9,434 10,991 116.5% 9,434 3,586 5,848 163.1%Total share-based compensation included in cost of revenue$24,283 $11,070 $13,213 119.4% $11,070 $4,351 $6,719 154.4%Product cost increased $45.6 million, or 53.3%, for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in product unit volume, as well as amortization of intellectual property licenses of $10.2 million.Product cost increased $22.1 million, or 34.8%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an increase in product unit volume.

For sales of our products, our higher throughput firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower throughput firewall products within each product series. For sales of our services, our subscriptions typically have higher gross margins than our support and maintenance. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

The decrease of 150 basis points in product margin was due to increased amortization of intellectual property licenses. The increase of 100 basis points in services margin was due to contributions from our higher margin subscription services, partially offset by an 80 basis points decrease due to amortization of purchased intangible assets.- 44 -Table of ContentsGross margin increased 100 basis points for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase of 90 basis points in product margin was due to continued focus on material cost reductions, partially offset by amortization of intellectual property licenses of $2.0 million. The increase of 170 basis points in services margin was due to contributions from our higher margin subscription services.Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and legal settlement expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2015, we expect to recognize approximately $557.0 million of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately three years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. •Research and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.•Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission costs. We expense commission costs as incurred. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, travel costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to increase the size of our sales force and have also substantially grown our sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.•General and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, professional services, and certain non-recurring general expenses. Professional services consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance, and investor relations, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue. •Legal Settlement. Legal settlement expense consists of charges related to the Settlement Agreement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet. Refer to the discussion under Note 9.

In addition, in fiscal 2014, we recognized expenses related to the intellectual property litigation with Juniper of $11.3 million and expenses related to our acquisitions of Cyvera and Morta of $4.4 million.General and administrative expense increased $30.4 million, or 71.2%, for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to an increase in professional services costs of $12.5 million, including expenses related to the intellectual property litigation with Juniper of $7.7 million and expenses related to our acquisitions of Cyvera and Morta of $4.4 million, an increase in personnel costs of $12.3 million, largely due to an increase in headcount, and an increase in allocated costs of $2.4 million.We incurred legal settlement expenses of $121.2 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 related to the Settlement Agreement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively.- 46 -Table of ContentsInterest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the Notes issued on June 30, 2014. This interest expense is non-cash and will range from $23.4 million to $25.7 million per year through fiscal 2019.

The warrant was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value from June 3, 2014, the issuance date of the warrant, through July 1, 2014, the date the warrant was exercised. In addition, for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, our interest income and our foreign currency remeasurement losses increased by $2.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively.Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, withholding taxes, federal and state income taxes in the United States, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.In fiscal 2015, we recorded deferred tax charges of $36.8 million. The current portion of the deferred tax charges is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remainder in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred tax charges are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately seven years as a component of provision for income taxes.

The provision for income taxes decreased $6.3 million for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 due to decreased U.S. taxable income, primarily attributable to the Settlement Agreement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet.- 47 -Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources July 31, 2015 2014 (in thousands)Working capital (1)$41,803 $610,155Cash, cash equivalents, and investments: Cash and cash equivalents$375,814 $653,812Investments952,006 320,570Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments$1,327,820 $974,382______________(1)As of July 31, 2015, the net carrying amount of the Notes and related debt issuance costs were classified as current liabilities and current assets, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 7. Convertible Senior Notes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.At July 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents and investments of $1.3 billion were held for working capital purposes, of which approximately $84.0 million was held outside of the United States. We do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, all of which we expect to reinvest outside of the United States indefinitely. However, if these funds were needed for our domestic operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. There are no other restrictions on the use of these funds. If we were to repatriate these earnings to the United States, any associated income tax liability would be insignificant. In June 2014, we issued the Notes, which mature on July 1, 2019, with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. Prior to January 1, 2019, holders may surrender their Notes for early conversion under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of the Notes, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and we may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with respect to the remainder of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted.During the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2015, the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the Notes for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of such quarter. As a result, holders may convert their Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2015. Refer to Note 7. Convertible Senior Notes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the Notes.The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain tax structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.- 48 -Table of ContentsOperating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $350.3 million, an increase of $261.9 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was due to growth of our business and changes in our assets and liabilities during fiscal 2015. Additionally, in fiscal 2014, we made a total of $95.0 million in payments related to legal settlements. Changes in assets and liabilities for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 include an increase in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2015, we made a tax payment of $12.8 million in connection with an intercompany transfer of intellectual property.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was $88.4 million, a decrease of $26.1 million compared to fiscal 2013, due to payments of $75.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 for the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $679.0 million, an increase of $358.7 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2015, partially offset by higher payments made in fiscal 2014 related to our acquisitions.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 was $320.3 million, an increase of $168.8 million compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was due to net cash payments of $85.7 million related to our acquisitions in fiscal 2014, an increase of $69.4 million in net purchases of available-for-sale investments, and an increase of $13.7 million in purchases of property, equipment, and other assets.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $50.7 million, a decrease of $524.4 million compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $527.7 million in fiscal 2014.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 was $575.1 million, an increase of $550.1 million compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $527.7 million. The remaining increase was due to higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans during fiscal 2014 and the last payments of our initial public offering costs in fiscal 2013.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2015: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3- 5 Years More Than 5 Years (in thousands) 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (1)$575,000 $— $— $— $575,000Operating lease obligations (2) (3) 409,156 20,821 51,507 83,626 253,202Purchase obligations (4)42,805 42,805 — — —Total (5)$1,026,961 $63,626 $51,507 $83,626 $828,202______________(1)As of July 31, 2015, holders may convert their Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2015.

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(5)No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2015, we had approximately $40.6 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough July 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support and maintenance, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy:•Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if available,•Third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or•Best estimate of selling price (BESP), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available.We establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. We establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. We establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing, whereby historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products or services). To further support the best estimate of selling price as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.Share-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to share-based transactions is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value estimated on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) is based on the closing market price of our - 50 -Table of Contentscommon stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options and shares sold through our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) are estimated on the grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected volatility of the price of our common stock.We recognize share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. Our estimated forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures. A change in our estimated forfeiture rate could have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Contract Manufacturer LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturer. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast, and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any - 51 -Table of Contentssuch matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We first analyze qualitative factors, which include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative analysis required under the two-step goodwill impairment test.Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, we first compare the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, operating trends, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.To date, we have not recognized any impairment losses on our goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Israeli Shekel, and Japanese Yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2015 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions. - 52 -Table of ContentsAs our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, currency fluctuations or a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion. Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2015 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2014, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.0% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the “Notes”). We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet. As this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of the Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 53 -",2023-12-30 20:21:29.658795

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is organized as follows:•Overview. A discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A.•Key Financial Metrics. A summary of our GAAP and non-GAAP key financial metrics, which management monitors to evaluate our performance.•Results of Operations.

A discussion of expected impacts of impending accounting changes on financial information to be reported in the future.Overview We have pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative platform that allows enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications running on their networks and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyber attacks. Our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud. Accordingly, our platform enables our end-customers to maintain the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems while pursuing technology initiatives, like cloud and mobility, that grow their business. We believe our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances and software products.Our Next-Generation Security Platform consists of three major elements: our Next-Generation Firewall, our Advanced Endpoint Protection, and our Threat Intelligence Cloud. Our Next-Generation Firewall delivers application, user, and content visibility and control as well as protection against network-based cyber threats integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture. Our Advanced Endpoint Protection prevents cyber attacks that aim to run malicious code or exploit software vulnerabilities on a broad variety of fixed and virtual endpoints and servers. Our Threat Intelligence Cloud provides central intelligence capabilities, security for SaaS applications, and automated delivery of preventative measures against cyber attacks.For fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, total revenue was $1.4 billion, $928.1 million, and $598.2 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 48.5% for fiscal 2016 and 55.1% for fiscal 2015. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support and maintenance. We believe this model will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2016, we had approximately 34,000 end-customers in over 140 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world.Our product revenue grew to $670.8 million or 48.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2016, representing year-over-year growth of 36.2%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in physical and virtualized form. Our Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which was released in August 2015 and is especially suited for very large enterprise deployments and service provider customers. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments.Our recurring services revenue grew to $707.7 million or 51.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2016, representing year-over-year growth of 62.5%, led by revenue from subscription services, which grew 67.8% to $357.0 million, and followed by support and maintenance services, which grew 57.5% to $350.7 million. Our subscriptions include two new services released during the first quarter of fiscal 2016: our Aperture subscription service, which provides added visibility and control within IT-sanctioned SaaS applications that are used to store and share end-customer’s data, and our AutoFocus cyber threat intelligence service, which provides prioritized actionable intelligence on targeted cyber attacks. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices.We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our distributors, which, in turn, to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. When end-customers purchase an appliance, they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality, as well as support and maintenance in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and services within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present - 37 -Table of Contentssignificant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “—Results of Operations.” July 31, 2016 2015 (in millions)Total deferred revenue$1,240.8 $713.7Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$1,938.4 $1,327.8 Year Ended July 31, 2016 2015 2014 (dollars in millions)Total revenue$1,378.5 $928.1 $598.2Total revenue year-over-year percentage increase48.5 % 55.1 % 51.0 %Gross margin percentage73.2 % 72.9 % 73.3 %Operating loss$(190.1) $(133.5) $(215.3)Operating margin percentage(13.8)% (14.4)% (36.0)%Billings$1,905.6 $1,219.1 $771.4Billings year-over-year percentage increase56.3 % 58.0 % 51.4 %Cash flow provided by operating activities$658.1 $350.3 $88.4Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$585.6 $316.5 $52.3•Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support and maintenance revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue during the period. We consider billings to be a key measure used by management to manage our business given our hybrid SaaS revenue model, and believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes services revenue, which is recognized ratably over the subscription period or the period in which the services are expected to be performed, as the case may be, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscriptions and support and maintenance services, and as we monitor our near term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:- 38 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Billings: Total revenue$1,378.5 $928.1 $598.2Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue527.1 291.0 173.2Billings$1,905.6 $1,219.1 $771.4•Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for both subscriptions and support and maintenance services. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP): Net cash provided by operating activities$658.1 $350.3 $88.4Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets72.5 33.8 36.1Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (1)$585.6 $316.5 $52.3Net cash used in investing activities$(338.9) $(679.0) $(320.3)Net cash provided by financing activities$39.4 $50.7 $575.1______________(1)Includes our cash payments of $75.0 million and $20.0 million in fiscal 2014 for the legal settlement with Juniper and the Mutual Covenant Not to Sue and Release Agreement with Fortinet, respectively.- 39 -Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.Our total revenue is comprised of the following:•Product Revenue. Product revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and, to a lesser extent, the VM-Series. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.•Services Revenue. Services revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscriptions and support and maintenance. Our contractual subscription and support and maintenance terms are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, such as Aperture and AutoFocus, renew existing services contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.

The increases in both periods were driven by increased demand for our higher end appliances. The change in product revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.Services revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. The increases in both periods were due to the adoption of subscriptions and high renewal rates for both subscriptions and support and maintenance services. The mix between subscription revenue and support and maintenance revenue will fluctuate over time, depending on the introduction of new - 41 -Table of Contentssubscription offerings, renewals of support and maintenance services, and our ability to increase sales to new and existing customers. The change in services revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of services revenue.Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our third-party contract manufacturer. Our cost of product revenue also includes amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping costs, personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and share-based compensation associated with our operations organization, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases.

The increases in both periods were driven by increases in personnel costs, which grew $42.1 million to $104.1 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and grew $25.8 million to $62.0 million for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increases in personnel costs in both periods were due to headcount growth. The remaining increases in both periods were due to expansion of our customer service capabilities and infrastructure to support our growing installed end-customer base.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between products and services. For sales of our products, our higher end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower end firewall products within each product series. For sales of our services, our subscriptions typically have higher gross - 42 -Table of Contentsmargins than our support and maintenance. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

Product gross margin decreased for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to increased amortization of intellectual property licenses as a result of the Settlement Agreement with Juniper in May 2014.Services gross margin was flat for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Services gross margin increased for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 due to contributions from our higher margin subscription services, partially offset by increased amortization of purchased intangible assets.Operating Expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and legal settlement expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2016, we expect to recognize approximately $822.9 million of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.4 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs.

Refer to the discussion under Note 9. Legal Settlement of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to these matters.- 44 -Table of ContentsInterest Expense Interest expense primarily consists of the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the 0.0% Convertible Seniors Notes due 2019 (the “Notes”).

In fiscal 2014, we recorded an expense of $5.9 million in other income (expense), net to record the change in fair value of the warrant issued to Juniper in connection with the Settlement Agreement. The warrant was classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value from June 3, 2014, the issuance date of the warrant, through July 1, 2014, the date the warrant was exercised. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, withholding taxes, federal and state income taxes in the United States, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures.In fiscal 2015, we recorded deferred tax charges of $36.8 million in connection with a corporate restructure. The current portion of the deferred tax charges is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remainder in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred tax charges are being amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately seven years as a component of provision for income taxes.

Refer to Note 7. Convertible Senior Notes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.At July 31, 2016, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.9 billion were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $148.6 million was held outside of the United States. We do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, all of which we expect to reinvest outside of the United States indefinitely. However, if these funds were needed for our domestic operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. There are no other restrictions on the use of these funds. If we were to repatriate these earnings to the United States, any associated income tax liability would be insignificant. As of July 31, 2016, all of the Notes remained outstanding. The Notes mature on July 1, 2019, however, prior to January 1, 2019, holders may surrender their Notes for early conversion under certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. Refer to Note 7. Convertible Senior Notes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the Notes.On August 26, 2016, our board of directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase which will be funded from available working capital. Repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, block purchase techniques, 10b5-1 trading plans, or a combination of the foregoing. The repurchase authorization will expire on August 31, 2018, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, - 46 -Table of Contentsand the continuing market acceptance of our products. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain tax structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was $658.1 million, an increase of $307.8 million compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was due to growth of our business and changes in our assets and liabilities during fiscal 2016, which included an increase in sales of subscription and support and maintenance contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue, and was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales near the end of the period.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was $350.3 million, an increase of $261.9 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was due to growth of our business and changes in our assets and liabilities during fiscal 2015. Additionally, in fiscal 2014, we made a total of $95.0 million in payments related to legal settlements. Changes in assets and liabilities for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 include an increase in sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue. In addition, during fiscal 2015, we made a tax payment of $12.8 million in connection with an intercompany transfer of intellectual property.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $338.9 million, a decrease of $340.1 million compared to fiscal 2015, due to lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments and a payment of $15.1 million related to our acquisition of CirroSecure in fiscal 2015, partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure and facilities to support the growth of our business.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 was $679.0 million, an increase of $358.7 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was due to higher net purchases of available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2015, partially offset by higher payments made in fiscal 2014 related to our acquisitions of Cyvera and Morta.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $39.4 million, a decrease of $11.3 million compared to fiscal 2015, due to a payment of deferred consideration related to our acquisition of Cyvera, lower proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans, and a decrease in excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2015 was $50.7 million, a decrease of $524.4 million compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $527.7 million in fiscal 2014.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2016: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3- 5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019$575.0 $— $575.0 $— $—Operating lease obligations (1) 509.3 27.3 79.5 103.9 298.6Purchase obligations (2)54.2 54.2 — — —Total (3)$1,138.5 $81.5 $654.5 $103.9 $298.6- 47 -Table of Contents______________(1)Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. Excludes contractual sublease proceeds of $5.1 million, of which $3.0 million will be received in less than one year and $2.1 million will be received in one to two years. Refer to Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our operating leases.(2)Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our independent contract manufacturer and original design manufacturers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(3)No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2016, we had approximately $48.4 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough July 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support and maintenance, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support and maintenance, and other services. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy:•Vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of selling price, if available,•Third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or•Best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available.We establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. We establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. We establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing, whereby historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products or services). To further support the best estimate of selling price as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.Share-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to share-based transactions is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value estimated on the grant date. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options and shares sold - 48 -Table of Contentsthrough our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected volatility of the price of our common stock.We recognize share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. Our estimated forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures. A change in our estimated forfeiture rate could have a significant impact on our share-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation expense on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Contract Manufacturer LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturer. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast, and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any - 49 -Table of Contentssuch matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We first analyze qualitative factors, which include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative analysis required under the two-step goodwill impairment test.Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, we first compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using significant judgment based on a combination of the income and the market approaches. If the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, operating trends, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.To date, we have not recognized any impairment losses on our goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, British pound, Singapore dollar, Israeli shekel, and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2016 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2016, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. On August 30, 2016, in an effort to reduce our foreign currency exchange exposure related to our euro-dominated expenditures for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017, we entered into forward contracts with a notional amount of €66.9 million. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and - 50 -Table of Contentseffectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2016 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2014, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Notes”). We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet. As this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of the Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 51 -",2023-12-30 20:21:29.456778

Our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud. Accordingly, our platform enables our end-customers to maintain the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems while pursuing technology initiatives, like cloud and mobility, that grow their business. We believe our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances and software products.Our Next-Generation Security Platform consists of three major elements: our Next-Generation Firewall, our Advanced Endpoint Protection, and our Threat Intelligence Cloud. Our Next-Generation Firewall comes in several physical and cloud-based software form-factors and delivers application, user, and content visibility and control as well as protection against network-based cyberthreats integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture. Our Advanced Endpoint Protection software prevents cyberattacks that aim to run malicious code or exploit software vulnerabilities on a broad variety of fixed, mobile, and virtual endpoints and servers. Our Threat Intelligence Cloud provides central intelligence capabilities, security for SaaS applications, and automated delivery of preventative measures against cyberattacks.For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, total revenue was $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion, and $928.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 27.8% for fiscal 2017 and 48.5% for fiscal 2016. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe this model will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2017, we had more than 42,500 end-customers in over 150 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works - 38 -Table of Contentsclosely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.Our product revenue grew to $709.1 million or 40.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2017, representing year-over-year growth of 5.7%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in physical and virtualized form. Our Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is especially suited for very large enterprise deployments and service provider customers. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $1.1 billion or 59.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2017, representing year-over-year growth of 48.7%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices. When end-customers purchase an appliance, they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality, as well as support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs.We continue to invest in and extend our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. In February 2017, we expanded our family of firewalls with the launch of several new appliances: our PA-220, which is designed for small branch offices and remote locations; our PA-800 series, which are ideal for medium-sized networks and branch and remote office environments; our PA-5200 series, which deliver security for high throughput environments in a compact form factor; and three new VM-Series virtual firewall models, which support cloud and virtualization initiatives ranging from virtualized branch offices to data center and service provider deployments. We also delivered PAN-OS 8.0, an important software release that expands security for public and private clouds, provides new SaaS application security functionality, and also provides the capabilities to prevent the theft and abuse of stolen credentials. Additionally, in February 2017, we acquired LightCyber Ltd. (“LightCyber”), a privately-held cybersecurity company. LightCyber’s technology expands the functionality of our platform through the addition of behavioral analytics, and will be the foundation for a new future subscription offering. We also expect to release two new cloud-based subscription offerings in September 2017: our GlobalProtect cloud service subscription, which provides our Next Generation Security Platform as a cloud-based service for remote offices and mobile users; and our Logging Service subscription, which functions as the central cloud-based repository for all application data and logs, and allows end-customers to collect data without needing to plan for local processing power and storage. We plan to continue our investment in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform. For example, in June 2017, we announced the next phase in the evolution of our Next-Generation Security Platform: our Palo Alto Networks Application Framework. Our cloud-based Application Framework will introduce a new SaaS consumption model under which our end-customers will be able to rapidly implement cloud-based security applications developed by us, third-party developers, or other security vendors, without having to deploy or manage additional products. We expect our Application Framework to become generally available in the early 2018 calendar year, with continuous and ongoing introduction of new security applications.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “—Results of Operations.”- 39 -Table of Contents July 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Total deferred revenue$1,773.5 $1,240.8Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$2,164.3 $1,938.4 Year Ended July 31, 2017 2016 2015 (dollars in millions)Total revenue$1,761.6 $1,378.5 $928.1Total revenue year-over-year percentage increase27.8 % 48.5 % 55.1 %Gross margin72.9 % 73.2 % 72.9 %Operating loss(1)$(179.8) $(157.3) $(99.8)Operating margin(1)(10.2)% (11.4)% (10.8)%Billings$2,293.4 $1,905.6 $1,219.1Billings year-over-year percentage increase20.4 % 56.3 % 58.0 %Cash flow provided by operating activities(2)$868.5 $658.6 $352.8Free cash flow (non-GAAP)(2)$705.1 $586.1 $319.0______________(1)Prior period amounts have been adjusted due to our voluntary change in accounting policy for sales commissions.

Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.•Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key measure used by management to manage our business given our hybrid SaaS revenue model, and believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:- 40 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Billings: Total revenue$1,761.6 $1,378.5 $928.1Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue531.8 527.1 291.0Billings$2,293.4 $1,905.6 $1,219.1•Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP): Net cash provided by operating activities(1)$868.5 $658.6 $352.8Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets163.4 72.5 33.8Free cash flow (non-GAAP)(1)$705.1 $586.1 $319.0Net cash used in investing activities$(472.6) $(338.9) $(679.0)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(1)$(386.0) $38.9 $48.2______________(1)Prior period amounts have been adjusted due to our early adoption of new share-based payment accounting guidance.

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. Product RevenueProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series.

Product revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2016 due to increased demand for our higher end appliances. The change in product revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.Subscription and Support RevenueSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support terms are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.

Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount.

For sales of our products, our higher end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower end firewall products within each product series. For sales of our subscription and support offerings, our subscription offerings typically have higher gross margins than our support offerings. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

Product gross margin increased for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 due to our continued focus on material cost reductions. Subscription and support gross margin increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to contributions from our higher margin subscription offerings. Subscription and support gross margin was flat for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2017, we expect to recognize approximately $906.8 million of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years, - 45 -Table of Contentsexcluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increases in personnel costs in both periods were primarily due to headcount growth. The remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business, and development costs related to investments in our new and future offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our sales presence internationally.

The increases in both periods were driven by increases in personnel costs, which grew $145.0 million to $716.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and grew $186.1 million to $520.2 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increases in personnel costs in both periods were primarily due to headcount growth. The remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business, and an increase in demand generation activities and sales related events to support our revenue growth.General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and - 46 -Table of Contentsimpairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount.

We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures.- 47 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in millions)Provision for income taxes(1)$22.5 $20.4 $2.1 10.3% $20.4 $9.4 $11.0 117.0%Effective tax rate(1)(11.6)% (11.8)% (11.8)% (7.7)% ______________(1)Prior period amounts have been adjusted due to our voluntary change in accounting policy for sales commissions.

As of July 31, 2017, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis differences relating to our investment in foreign subsidiaries; accordingly, there is no restriction on the use of these funds.As of July 31, 2017, all of the Notes remained outstanding. The Notes mature on July 1, 2019, however, prior to January 1, 2019, holders may surrender their Notes for early conversion under certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. Refer to Note 8. Convertible Senior Notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the Notes.In August 2016, our board of directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase and, in February 2017, authorized a $500.0 million increase to our repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.0 billion. Repurchases are funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. The repurchase authorization will expire on December 31, 2018, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2017, $580.0 million was available for future share repurchases under the repurchase authorization. Refer to Note 10.

Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $868.5 million, an increase of $209.9 million compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings, and an increase in collections on accounts receivable during fiscal 2017.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was $658.6 million, an increase of $305.8 million compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was due to growth of our business and changes in our assets and liabilities during fiscal 2016, which included an increase in sales of subscription and support contracts to new and existing customers as reflected by an increase in deferred revenue, and was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales near the end of the period.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 was $472.6 million, an increase of $133.7 million compared to fiscal 2016, due to increased investment in facilities to support the growth of our business and a net cash payment of $90.7 million for our acquisition of LightCyber, partially offset by lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments during fiscal 2017.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 was $338.9 million, a decrease of $340.1 million compared to fiscal 2015, due to lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments and a payment of $15.1 million related to our acquisition of CirroSecure in fiscal 2015, partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure and facilities to support the growth of our business.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.- 49 -Table of ContentsCash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $386.0 million, a change of $424.9 million compared to fiscal 2016, due to the repurchase of $411.0 million of our common stock and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards of $21.4 million during fiscal 2017.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 was $38.9 million, a decrease of $9.3 million compared to fiscal 2015, due to a payment of deferred consideration related to our acquisition of Cyvera and lower proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2017: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019$575.0 $— $575.0 $— $—Operating lease obligations(1) 517.5 31.0 110.8 111.2 264.5Purchase obligations(2)104.1 98.5 5.6 — —Total(3)$1,196.6 $129.5 $691.4 $111.2 $264.5______________(1)Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. Excludes contractual sublease proceeds of $2.1 million, which will be received in less than one year. Refer to Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our operating leases.(2)Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(3)No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2017, we had approximately $62.2 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThrough July 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support contracts, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support, and other services. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy:•Vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of selling price, if available,- 50 -Table of Contents•Third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or•Best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available.We establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. We establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. We establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing, whereby historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products or services). To further support BESP as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Manufacturing Partner and Supplier LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast, and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.- 51 -Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.To date, we have not recognized any impairment losses on our goodwill and intangible assets. In fiscal 2017, we recognized an impairment loss of $20.9 million on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. We did not recognize any impairment losses on our other long-lived assets prior to fiscal 2017.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, British pound, Singapore dollar, Israeli shekel, and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in - 52 -Table of Contentsforeign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2017 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2017, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 4. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2017 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2014, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Notes”). We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of the Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 53 -",2023-12-30 20:21:29.263360

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is organized as follows:•Overview.

A discussion of expected impacts of impending accounting changes on financial information to be reported in the future.Overview We have pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative Security Operating Platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications and data running in their networks, on their endpoints, and in the cloud, and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyberattacks. Our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud. Accordingly, our platform enables our end-customers to pursue transformative digital initiatives, like public cloud and mobility, that grow their business, while maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems. We believe the architecture of our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products, and consists of four primary security capabilities: •Security for networks through our Next-Generation Firewalls, available as physical appliances, virtual appliances (called VM-Series), or a cloud-delivered service (called GlobalProtect cloud service) and Panorama management delivered as an appliance or as a virtual machine for the public or private cloud.•Security for endpoints through our Traps advanced endpoint protection software, delivered as a light-weight software agent with cloud or on-premise management capabilities.•Security for the cloud through our VM-Series for in-line protection of workloads in public and private clouds, Traps for host-based public cloud infrastructure protection, Evident for infrastructure monitoring and compliance in public clouds, and Aperture for protecting SaaS applications. These products are delivered as software or SaaS applications.•Other security services, such as WildFire, Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, and GlobalProtect subscriptions that are delivered as attached software services to our appliances, as well as applications delivered in connection with our Application Framework, such as AutoFocus, Magnifier, and Logging Service that are delivered as SaaS applications. For fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, total revenue was $2.3 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.4 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 29.0% for fiscal 2018 and 27.8% for fiscal 2017. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe this model will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2018, we had more than 54,000 end-customers in - 37 -Table of Contentsover 150 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.Our product revenue grew to $871.5 million or 38.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 22.9%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in physical and virtualized form. Our Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-200, which is designed for enterprise remote offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is especially suited for very large enterprise deployments and service provider customers. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $1.4 billion or 61.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 33.2%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical or virtual firewall appliances, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. We introduced several new offerings during fiscal 2018, including:•our GlobalProtect cloud service subscription, which provides our Security Operating Platform as a cloud-based service for remote offices and mobile users;•our Logging Service subscription, which functions as the central cloud-based repository for application data and logs generated by our security offerings, including those of our firewalls and GlobalProtect cloud service subscription, and allows end-customers to collect data without needing to plan for local processing power and storage; •Magnifier, a cloud-based subscription that enables organizations to identify and prevent behavior-based threats by applying machine learning to rich network, endpoint, and cloud data;•PAN-OS 8.1, with over 60 new features, and several new models of appliances, including the PA-3200 series, which increase SSL decryption throughput, bring higher performance and capacity for securing large data centers, and provide additional capabilities for managing large firewall deployments; and•Traps 5.0, which included a cloud-delivered management service and integration with our Logging Service to allow for the collection of detailed endpoint event data.We also expanded the capabilities of our platform with extended protections to the GCP and enhanced capabilities for AWS and Azure environments to enable customers to easily integrate with their cloud infrastructure and workloads in multi-cloud environments. Further, in March 2018, we acquired Evident.io, which has expanded our API-based security capabilities for the public cloud with the addition of Evident.io’s cloud services infrastructure protection technology, and, in April 2018, we acquired Secdo, which expands the functionality of Traps, as well as other capabilities of our platform, by adding endpoint detection and response capabilities, including unique data collection and visualization.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.- 38 -Table of ContentsKey Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “—Results of Operations.” Year Ended July 31, 2018 2017 2016 (dollars in millions)Total revenue$2,273.1 $1,761.6 $1,378.5Total revenue year-over-year percentage increase29.0 % 27.8 % 48.5 %Gross margin71.6 % 72.9 % 73.2 %Operating loss$(129.1) $(179.8) $(157.3)Operating margin(5.7)% (10.2)% (11.4)%Billings$2,860.2 $2,293.4 $1,905.6Billings year-over-year percentage increase24.7 % 20.4 % 56.3 %Cash flow provided by operating activities$1,037.0 $868.5 $658.6Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$925.0 $705.1 $586.1 July 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Total deferred revenue$2,364.9 $1,773.5Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$3,950.9 $2,164.3•Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key measure used by management to manage our business given our hybrid SaaS revenue model, and believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner: Year Ended July 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Billings: Total revenue$2,273.1 $1,761.6 $1,378.5Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue587.1 531.8 527.1Billings$2,860.2 $2,293.4 $1,905.6•Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating - 39 -Table of Contentsactivities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP): Net cash provided by operating activities$1,037.0 $868.5 $658.6Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets112.0 163.4 72.5Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$925.0 $705.1 $586.1Net cash used in investing activities$(520.0) $(472.6) $(338.9)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$1,245.6 $(386.0) $38.9- 40 -Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. Product RevenueProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

The change in product revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.Subscription and Support RevenueSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support terms are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over the contractual service period. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base. Prior to fiscal 2017, subscription and support revenue was referred to as services revenue. The composition of subscription and support revenue has not been modified.

The increase in both periods was due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from both new and existing end-customers. The mix between subscription revenue and support revenue will fluctuate over time, depending on the introduction of new subscription offerings, renewals of support services, and our ability to increase sales to new and existing customers. The change in subscription and support revenue due to changes in pricing was not significant for either period.- 42 -Table of ContentsRevenue by Geographic Theater Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in millions)Americas$1,558.7 $1,237.4 $321.3 26.0% $1,237.4 $973.2 $264.2 27.1%EMEA439.3 320.1 119.2 37.2% 320.1 247.1 73.0 29.5%APAC275.1 204.1 71.0 34.8% 204.1 158.2 45.9 29.0%Total revenue$2,273.1 $1,761.6 $511.5 29.0% $1,761.6 $1,378.5 $383.1 27.8%With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both EMEA and APAC increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases.

We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases. Prior to fiscal 2017, cost of subscription and support revenue was referred to as cost of services revenue. The composition of cost of subscription and support revenue has not been modified.

The remaining increase was primarily due to data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, costs to expand our customer service capabilities, and allocated costs. The increase in allocated costs was primarily due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.Cost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $45.3 million to $155.4 million, largely due to headcount growth. The remaining increase was primarily driven by costs to expand our customer service capabilities and infrastructure, customer support and repair costs, and allocated costs. The increase in allocated costs was primarily due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, the average sales price of our products, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. For sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. For sales of our subscription and support offerings, our subscription offerings typically have higher gross margins than our support offerings. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above. Year Ended July 31, 2018 2017 2016 Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin Amount GrossMargin (dollars in millions)Product$599.1 68.7% $507.7 71.6% $495.4 73.9%Subscription and support1,028.7 73.4% 777.3 73.9% 513.1 72.5%Total gross profit$1,627.8 71.6% $1,285.0 72.9% $1,008.5 73.2%Product gross margin decreased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, driven by higher product costs related to our newly introduced appliances, which have lower product margins.Subscription and support gross margin decreased slightly for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings and costs to expand our customer service capabilities, partially offset by a decrease in customer support and repair costs. Subscription and support gross margin increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to contributions from our higher margin subscription offerings.Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2018, we expect to recognize approximately $1.1 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.0 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.- 44 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in millions)Research and development$400.7 $347.4 $53.3 15.3% $347.4 $284.2 $63.2 22.2%Number of employees at period end947 766 181 23.6% 766 637 129 20.3%Research and development expense increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

The increases in personnel costs in both periods were primarily due to headcount growth. The remaining increase for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. The remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business, and development costs related to investments in our new and future offerings.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increases in personnel costs in both periods were primarily due to headcount growth. The remaining increase for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. The remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business, and an increase in demand generation activities and sales related events to support our revenue growth.General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Refer to Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The remaining increase was primarily driven by costs related to business acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018, an increase in personnel costs, and increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. Personnel costs grew $10.2 million to $138.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to headcount growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses due to the $20.9 million loss recognized in fiscal 2017 on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. General and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $29.3 million to $128.1 million, largely due to headcount growth, and a fiscal 2017 impairment loss of $20.9 million on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. The remaining increase for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily consists of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our 2019 Notes and 2023 Notes, and also includes the contractual interest expense related to our 2023 Notes.

We expect interest expense to increase in fiscal 2019 due to interest expense to be incurred on the 2023 Notes, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 2019 Notes due to conversions before or upon maturity. Interest expense recognized in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was primarily related to the 2019 Notes. Refer to Note 8.

Other income, net increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 due to an increase in interest income, partially offset by increased foreign currency remeasurement losses.Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, withholding taxes, U.S. state income taxes, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. To the extent we revisit our corporate structure, it may have an impact on our tax provision. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law. The TCJA provides for significant tax law changes and modifications including, but not limited to, the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% - 46 -Table of Contentsas of January 1, 2018, the requirement for companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us during the three months ended January 31, 2018, while other provisions will impact us beginning in our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019.

The provision for income taxes decreased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to changes in valuation allowance related to the acquisition of Evident.io and future benefits from alternative minimum tax credits under the TCJA.During the year ended July 31, 2018, we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA which were included as components of income tax expense and reflected in the effective tax rates above. We will continue to assess the impact of the TCJA on our business and our consolidated financial statements, however, the final impact of the TCJA may differ from the provisional amounts due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, and the need for further guidance on the related income tax accounting. Refer to Note 12. Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the TCJA and its expected impact.We recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2017 due to foreign income taxes, withholding taxes, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. The provision for income taxes increased for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in foreign withholding taxes and U.S. income taxes related to intercompany transactions, offset by tax benefits from our adoption of new share-based payment accounting guidance in fiscal 2017.Liquidity and Capital Resources July 31, 2018 2017 (in millions)Working capital(1)$1,992.6 $775.0Cash, cash equivalents, and investments: Cash and cash equivalents$2,506.9 744.3Investments1,444.0 1,420.0Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments$3,950.9$2,164.3______________(1)The net carrying amount of the 2019 Notes was classified in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of July 31, 2018.

Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings were not material as of July 31, 2018. In June 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million and in July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. As of July 31, 2018, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes of each series remained outstanding. The 2019 Notes and the 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2019 and July 1, 2023, respectively; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their Notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity dates. Upon conversion of the Notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted. Refer to Note 8. - 47 -Table of ContentsConvertible Senior Notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes. Subsequent to July 31, 2018, through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $327.3 million in principal amount of the 2019 Notes was converted or had been submitted by the holders for conversion and will settle during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2018. On September 4, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. Refer to Note 18. Subsequent Event in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. In August 2016, our board of directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase and, in February 2017, authorized a $500.0 million increase to the repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.0 billion. Repurchases are funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. The repurchase authorization will expire on December 31, 2018, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2018, $330.0 million was available for future share repurchases under the repurchase authorization. Refer to Note 10. Stockholders’ Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the repurchase authorization. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016: Year Ended July 31,2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,037.0 $868.5 $658.6Net cash used in investing activities(520.0) (472.6) (338.9)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,245.6 (386.0) 38.9Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$1,762.6 $9.9 $358.6We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $1,037.0 million, an increase of $168.5 million compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings during fiscal 2018.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was $868.5 million, an increase of $209.9 million compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings, and an increase in collections on accounts receivable during fiscal 2017.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 was $520.0 million, an increase of $47.4 million compared to fiscal 2017, due to an increase in net cash payments for acquisitions, partially offset by lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments and capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 was $472.6 million, an increase of $133.7 million compared to fiscal 2016, due to increased investment in facilities to support the growth of our business and a net cash payment of $90.7 million for our acquisition of LightCyber, partially offset by lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments during fiscal 2017.- 48 -Table of ContentsFinancing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and related transactions, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was $1,245.6 million, an increase of $1,631.6 million compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was mainly due to net proceeds of $1,495.8 million from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges, partially offset by an increase in payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards during fiscal 2018. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2017 was $386.0 million, a change of $424.9 million compared to fiscal 2016, due to the repurchase of $411.0 million of our common stock and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards of $21.4 million during fiscal 2017.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2018: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019(1)$575.0 $575.0 $— $— $—0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 20231,693.0 — — 1,693.0 —Operating lease obligations(2) 540.6 66.3 132.2 118.3 223.8Purchase obligations(3)146.3 138.3 8.0 — —Total(4)$2,954.9 $779.6 $140.2 $1,811.3 $223.8______________(1)As of July 31, 2018, holders may convert their 2019 Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2018. Refer to Note 8. Convertible Senior Notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. (2) Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. Excludes contractual sublease proceeds of $14.0 million, which consists of $5.0 million to be received in less than one year, and $9.0 million to be received in one to three years. Refer to Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our operating leases.(3)Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud services with a third-party provider. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(4)No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2018, we had approximately $78.9 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of July 31, 2018, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. - 49 -Table of ContentsWe believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of subscriptions and support contracts, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of hardware, software, subscriptions, support, and other services. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception. The estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy:•Vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of selling price, if available,•Third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price, if VSOE of selling price is not available, or•Best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE of selling price are available.We establish VSOE of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. We establish TPE of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners. We establish BESP primarily based on historical transaction pricing, whereby historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products or services). To further support BESP as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable, such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service, we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go-to-market strategy. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management. In determining BESP, we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment. As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods, and the timing of our revenue recognition could be affected.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Accounting standards require companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff and FASB issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts for the effects of the TCJA during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. In accordance with this guidance, we have determined the amounts recorded and positions taken, as discussed, are provisional as of July 31, 2018. We continue to assess the impacts of the TCJA, and the final impact of the TCJA recorded by us may differ from the provisional amounts due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by U.S. federal and state tax authorities, and the need for further guidance on the related income tax accounting.- 50 -Table of ContentsManufacturing Partner and Supplier LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast, and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.- 51 -Table of ContentsCease-use LossUpon exiting a leased property before the lease term expires, we assess the fair value of our remaining obligation under the lease and record a cease-use loss, if needed. The cease-use loss is calculated as the present value of the amount by which the remaining lease obligation, adjusted for the effects of any deferred items recognized under the lease and related costs, exceeds the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained. The key assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the discount rate. The cease-use loss recorded or to be recorded may change significantly as a result of the remeasurement of the cease-use liability, if the timing or amount of estimated cash flows change.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, British pound, Singapore dollar, Israeli shekel, and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2018 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2018, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 14 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 4. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2018 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn June 2014, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and, in July 2018, we issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes” and, together with the 2019 Notes, the “Notes”). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of either series of Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 52 -",2023-12-30 20:21:31.331716

Our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud. Accordingly, our platform enables our end-customers to pursue transformative digital initiatives, like public cloud and mobility, that grow their business, while maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect their valued data and critical control systems. We believe the architecture of our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure and eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone hardware and software security products, and consists of three primary areas of security capabilities. Secure the Enterprise:•Secure the network through our Next-Generation Firewalls, available as physical appliances, virtual appliances called VM-Series, or a cloud-delivered service called Prisma Access (formerly GlobalProtect cloud service), and Panorama management delivered as an appliance or as a virtual machine for the public or private cloud. This also includes security services such as WildFire, Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, GlobalProtect, and DNS Security that are delivered as SaaS subscriptions to our Next-Generation Firewalls. •Secure the endpoints through our Traps advanced endpoint protection software, delivered as a light-weight software agent with cloud or on-premise management capabilities.Secure the Cloud:•Secure the cloud through our Prisma cloud security offerings, such as Prisma Public Cloud (formerly RedLock) for security and compliance in public clouds, Prisma Access (formerly GlobalProtect cloud service) for securing user access, Prisma SaaS (formerly Aperture) for protecting SaaS applications, VM-Series for in-line network security in public and private clouds, Traps for host-based public cloud infrastructure protection, and Twistlock for protecting containers in public and private clouds, as well as PureSec for protecting serverless functions in public clouds.- 38 -Table of ContentsSecure the Future:•Secure the future of security operations through our Cortex platform, which includes Cortex XDR (formerly Magnifier) for detection and response, Cortex Data Lake (formerly Logging Service) to collect and integrate security data for analytics, Demisto for security orchestration, automation, and response (“SOAR”), and AutoFocus for threat intelligence. These products are delivered as software or SaaS subscriptions.For fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, total revenue was $2.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 27.5% for fiscal 2019 and 29.5% for fiscal 2018. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our hybrid SaaS revenue model, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe this model will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2019, we had end-customers in over 150 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.Our product revenue grew to $1.1 billion or 37.8% of total revenue for fiscal 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 24.6%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in physical and virtualized form. Our Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our proprietary PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-220, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is especially suited for very large enterprise deployments and service provider customers. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $1.8 billion or 62.2% of total revenue for fiscal 2019, representing year-over-year growth of 29.4%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical or virtual firewall appliances, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our platform, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. For example: in October 2018, we acquired RedLock, which expanded our security capabilities for the public cloud with the addition of RedLock’s cloud security analytics technology; in February 2019, we introduced PAN-OS 9.0, with over 60 new features, our new DNS Security Service subscription, which uses machine learning to proactively block malicious domains and stop attacks in progress, and Cortex XDR, our cloud-based detection, investigation, and response application that natively integrates network, endpoint, and cloud data; in March 2019, we acquired Demisto, which expanded the functionality of our platform with the addition of Demisto’s SOAR product; and in June and July 2019, we acquired PureSec and Twistlock, respectively, which extend our Prisma cloud security strategy with the addition of PureSec’s security for serverless applications and Twistlock’s container security capabilities. We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our platform and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.- 39 -Table of ContentsKey Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies.

Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business given our hybrid SaaS revenue model, and believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:- 40 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, 2019 2018(1) 2017(1) (in millions)Billings: Total revenue$2,899.6 $2,273.6 $1,755.1Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue590.2 582.6 496.6Billings$3,489.8 $2,856.2 $2,251.7______________(1)These amounts have been adjusted due to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. •Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below: Year Ended July 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP): Net cash provided by operating activities(1)$1,055.6 $1,038.1 $868.8Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets131.2 112.0 163.4Free cash flow (non-GAAP)(1)$924.4 $926.1 $705.4Net cash used in investing activities$(1,825.9) $(520.0) $(472.6)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(773.9) $1,245.6 $(386.0)______________(1)The amounts for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 have been adjusted due to our adoption of new guidance related to the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. Product RevenueProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.

Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Product revenue increased for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased demand for our appliances. Product revenue increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to increased demand for our newly introduced appliances. The change in product revenue due to pricing was not significant for either period.Subscription and Support RevenueSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.

Subscription and support revenue increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. The increase in both periods was due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from both new and existing end-customers. The mix between subscription revenue and support revenue will fluctuate over time, depending on the introduction of new subscription offerings, renewals of support services, and our ability to increase sales to new and existing end-customers. The change in subscription and support revenue due to changes in pricing was not significant for either period.- 43 -Table of ContentsRevenue by Geographic Theater Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2019 2018(1) Change 2018(1) 2017(1) Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in millions)Americas$1,982.3 $1,558.7 $423.6 27.2% $1,558.7 $1,230.6 $328.1 26.7%EMEA564.8 439.6 125.2 28.5% 439.6 320.3 119.3 37.2%APAC352.5 275.3 77.2 28.0% 275.3 204.2 71.1 34.8%Total revenue$2,899.6 $2,273.6 $626.0 27.5% $2,273.6 $1,755.1 $518.5 29.5%______________(1)These amounts have been adjusted due to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific and Japan (“APAC”) increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 due to our investment in increasing the size of our sales force and number of channel partners in these theaters.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount.

Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Cost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in costs to support the growth of our subscription and support business. Personnel costs grew $45.7 million to $254.5 million primarily due to headcount growth. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased $26.2 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of our recent acquisitions. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings and costs to expand our customer service capabilities.Cost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, which grew $53.5 million to $208.9 million, primarily due to headcount growth. The remaining increase was primarily due to data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, costs to expand our customer service capabilities, and allocated costs. The increase in allocated costs was primarily due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, the average sales price of our products, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. For sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. For sales of our subscription and support offerings, our subscription offerings typically have higher gross margins than our support offerings. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

Product gross margin increased for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to improved operations in our supply chain management and increased leverage of our operations organization. Product gross margin decreased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, driven by higher product costs related to our newly introduced appliances, which had lower product margins.Subscription and support gross margin decreased for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher amortization of purchased intangibles as a result of our recent acquisitions and costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, partially offset by increased leverage of our global customer support organization. Subscription and support gross margin decreased slightly for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher data center and cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings and costs to expand our customer service capabilities, partially offset by a decrease in customer support and repair costs. - 45 -Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2019, we expect to recognize approximately $1.5 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.7 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increase in personnel costs in both periods was primarily due to headcount growth. The remaining increase for both fiscal 2019 and 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Sales and marketing expense increased year-over-year for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. The increase in both periods was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $181.7 million to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and grew $133.8 million to $829.6 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in personnel costs in both periods was largely due to headcount growth. The remaining increase for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs, an increase in costs associated with marketing-related activities, and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets, which increased - 46 -Table of Contentsfor fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of our recent acquisitions. The remaining increase for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business.General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth and expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with our business acquisitions in fiscal 2019. These increases were substantially offset by a net decrease of $32.2 million in cease-use losses recognized on the lease of our previous corporate headquarter facilities. Refer to Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.General and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a cease-use loss of $39.2 million recognized on the lease of our previous corporate headquarter facilities during fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The remaining increase was primarily driven by costs related to business acquisitions completed during fiscal 2018, an increase in personnel costs, and an increase in allocated costs due to our expansion of facilities to support the growth of our business. Personnel costs grew $10.2 million to $138.7 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to headcount growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses due to the $20.9 million loss recognized in fiscal 2017 on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Interest ExpenseInterest expense primarily consists of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes” and, together with the 2019 Notes, the “Notes”), and also includes the contractual interest expense related to our 2023 Notes.

The increase in both periods was primarily due to interest expense recognized on the 2023 Notes issued in July 2018. The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2019 was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense recognized on the 2019 Notes due to conversions of the 2019 Notes before and upon maturity in July 2019. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.- 47 -Table of Contents Year Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31, 2019 2018 Change 2018 2017 Change Amount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount % (dollars in millions)Other income, net$63.4 $28.5 $34.9 122.5% $28.5 $10.2 $18.3 179.4%Other income, net increased for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily driven by a $42.6 million increase in interest income, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency remeasurement and transaction losses. Other income, net increased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily driven by a $12.4 million increase in interest income and an increase in foreign currency remeasurement gains. The increase in interest income in both periods was largely due to higher cash, cash equivalents and investments balances and higher yields on these balances during the respective periods. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, withholding taxes, and U.S. state income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. To the extent we revisit our corporate structure, it may have an impact on our tax provision.

Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. We recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2019 primarily due to foreign and state income taxes and withholding taxes. Our provision for income taxes decreased for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance related to acquisitions completed during fiscal 2019 and our adoption of accounting guidance requiring the recognition of income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes due to growth in non-U.S. operations.We recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2018 due to foreign income taxes, withholding taxes, and amortization of our deferred tax charges. Our provision for income taxes decreased for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance related to the acquisition of Evident.io and future benefits from alternative minimum tax credits under the TCJA, which was enacted into law in December 2017.

Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the Notes.As of July 31, 2019, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $3.4 billion were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $243.5 million was held outside of the United States. As of July 31, 2019, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material. In June 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The 2019 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2019. During fiscal 2019, we repaid in cash $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. The 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2023; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their 2023 Notes for conversion prior to the maturity date. Upon conversion of the 2023 Notes, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes being converted. As of July 31, 2019, all of the 2023 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.In September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. As of July 31, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. In August 2016, our board of directors authorized a $500.0 million share repurchase program and, in February 2017, authorized a $500.0 million increase to the repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.0 billion. The repurchase program expired on December 31, 2018. In February 2019, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. This repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2020, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2019, $1.0 billion remained available for future share repurchases under the new repurchase authorization. Refer to Note 12. Stockholders’ Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the repurchase programs. - 49 -Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017: Year Ended July 31,2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities(1)$1,055.6 $1,038.1 $868.8Net cash used in investing activities(1,825.9) (520.0) (472.6)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(773.9) 1,245.6 (386.0)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash(1)$(1,544.2) $1,763.7 $10.2______________(1)The amounts for fiscal 2018 and 2017 have been adjusted due to our adoption of new guidance related to the presentation of restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, and the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 was $1.1 billion, an increase of $17.5 million compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings during fiscal 2019. This was partially offset by repayments of the 2019 Notes attributable to the debt discount of $97.6 million during fiscal 2019.Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $169.3 million compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was due to growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings during fiscal 2018.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 was $1.8 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher net purchases of investments and an increase in net cash payments for business acquisitions during fiscal 2019.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 was $520.0 million, an increase of $47.4 million compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was due to higher net cash payments for business acquisitions, partially offset by lower net purchases of available-for-sale investments and capital expenditures during fiscal 2018.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and related transactions, repayments of the 2019 Notes, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2019 was $773.9 million, a change of $2.0 billion compared to fiscal 2018. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges received during fiscal 2018 and repayments of the 2019 Notes during fiscal 2019.- 50 -Table of ContentsCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was $1.2 billion, a change of $1.6 billion compared to fiscal 2017. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges, partially offset by an increase in payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards during fiscal 2018.Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2019: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023$1,693.0 $— $— $1,693.0 $—Operating lease obligations(1) 491.8 74.1 130.1 105.7 181.9Purchase obligations(2)427.6 119.2 85.9 125.0 97.5Total(3)$2,612.4 $193.3 $216.0 $1,923.7 $279.4______________(1) Consists of contractual obligations from our non-cancelable operating leases. Excludes contractual sublease proceeds of $9.8 million, which consists of $5.6 million to be received in less than one year and $4.2 million to be received in one to three years. Refer to Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our operating leases.(2)Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum or fixed purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud and other services with third-party providers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(3)No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2019, we had approximately $72.9 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of July 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities and, accordingly, are distinct from our subscriptions and support services, as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount we are due in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.We establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include - 51 -Table of Contentsfactors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international) and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.Deferred Contract CostsWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal commissions are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration of contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Manufacturing Partner and Supplier LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast, and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such - 52 -Table of Contentsmatters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.Cease-use LossUpon exiting a leased property before the lease term expires, we assess the fair value of our remaining obligation under the lease and record a cease-use loss, if needed. The cease-use loss is calculated as the present value of the amount by which the remaining lease obligation, adjusted for the effects of any deferred items recognized under the lease and related costs, exceeds the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained. The key assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts and the discount rate. The cease-use loss recorded or to be recorded may change significantly as a result of the remeasurement of the cease-use liability, if the timing or amount of estimated cash flows change.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, British pound, Singapore dollar, Israeli shekel, and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2019 would not be material to - 53 -Table of Contentsour financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2019, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 15 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 5. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2019 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn July 2018, we issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of either series of Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 54 -",2023-12-30 20:21:31.959463

These products are delivered as software or SaaS subscriptions.For fiscal 2020 and 2019, total revenue was $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 17.5%. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2020, we had end-customers in over 170 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.Our product revenue was $1.1 billion or 31.2% of total revenue for fiscal 2020, representing a slight decrease year-over-year of 2.9%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-powered Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in a number of form factors, including as physical, virtual and containerized appliances. Our ML-powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-220, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secures container environments and traffic.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $2.3 billion or 68.8% of total revenue for fiscal 2020, representing year-over-year growth of 30.0%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, and modern malware prevention capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual or container firewall appliances, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2020, we introduced several new offerings, including: PAN-OS 10.0 with over 70 new features; our new ML-powered Next-Generation Firewalls; and our Cortex XSOAR solution that redefines security orchestration and automation with integrated threat intelligence management. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that fit well within our long-term strategy. For example, in September 2019, we acquired Zingbox, which we believe will accelerate our delivery of IoT security through our Next-Generation Firewall and Cortex offerings; in December 2019, we acquired Aporeto, which we believe will strengthen our cloud-native security platform capabilities delivered by Prisma Cloud; and in April 2020, we acquired CloudGenix, which we believe will strengthen our SASE offering.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Impact of COVID-19 on our BusinessWe are actively monitoring, evaluating and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has and is expected to result in continued significant global social and business disruption. As described in “Impacts of COVID-19 on our Business” included in Part I, Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, we have made some changes to our business that include instituting a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020 that did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2020. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology to our employees, end-customers and partners to help them do their best work while remote.Although some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, COVID-19 may curtail our end-customers' spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on - 39 -Table of Contentsdevelopments, including the duration and spread of the virus, impact on our end-customers’ spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing business, results of operations and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “—Results of Operations.”July 31,20202019(in millions)Total deferred revenue$3,810.2 $2,888.7 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$4,302.2 $3,378.5 Year Ended July 31,202020192018(dollars in millions)Total revenue$3,408.4 $2,899.6 $2,273.6 Total revenue year-over-year percentage increase17.5 %27.5 %29.5 %Gross margin70.7 %72.1 %71.6 %Operating loss$(179.0)$(54.1)$(104.2)Operating margin(5.3)%(1.9)%(4.6)%Billings$4,301.7 $3,489.8 $2,856.2 Billings year-over-year percentage increase23.3 %22.2 %26.8 %Cash flow provided by operating activities$1,035.7 $1,055.6 $1,038.1 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$821.3 $924.4 $926.1 • Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:- 40 -Table of ContentsYear Ended July 31,202020192018(in millions)Billings:Total revenue$3,408.4 $2,899.6 $2,273.6 Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue893.3 590.2 582.6 Billings$4,301.7 $3,489.8 $2,856.2 • Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.• Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:Year Ended July 31,202020192018(in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP):Net cash provided by operating activities$1,035.7 $1,055.6 $1,038.1 Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets214.4 131.2 112.0 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$821.3 $924.4 $926.1 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$288.0 $(1,825.9)$(520.0)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$673.0 $(773.9)$1,245.6 - 41 -Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. Product RevenueProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20202019Change20192018ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Product$1,064.2 $1,096.2 $(32.0)(2.9)%$1,096.2 $879.8 $216.4 24.6 %Product revenue decreased slightly for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to product mix and pricing, partially offset by an increase in product unit volume.Subscription and Support RevenueSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20202019Change20192018ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Subscription$1,405.3 $1,032.7 $372.6 36.1 %$1,032.7 $758.1 $274.6 36.2 %Support938.9 770.7 168.2 21.8 %770.7 635.7135.0 21.2 %Total subscription and support$2,344.2 $1,803.4 $540.8 30.0 %$1,803.4 $1,393.8 $409.6 29.4 %Subscription and support revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2020 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from both new and existing end-customers, reflecting increased adoption of our portfolio. The mix between subscription revenue and support revenue will fluctuate over time, depending on the introduction of new subscription offerings, renewals of support services, and our ability to increase sales to new and existing end-customers. The change in subscription and support revenue due to changes in pricing was not significant for fiscal 2020.Revenue by Geographic TheaterYear Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20202019Change20192018ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Americas$2,327.9 $1,982.3 $345.6 17.4 %$1,982.3 $1,558.7 $423.6 27.2 %EMEA664.8 564.8 100.0 17.7 %564.8 439.6 125.2 28.5 %APAC415.7 352.5 63.2 17.9 %352.5 275.3 77.2 28.0 %Total revenue$3,408.4 $2,899.6 $508.8 17.5 %$2,899.6 $2,273.6 $626.0 27.5 %With respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for fiscal 2020 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific and Japan (“APAC”) increased year-over-year for fiscal 2020 due to our increasing investment in global sales force to maintain our growth and innovation.- 43 -Table of ContentsCost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping and tariff costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate with our product revenue.

Cost of Subscription and Support RevenueCost of subscription and support revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, customer support and repair costs, third-party professional services costs, data center and cloud hosting costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software development costs, and allocated costs. We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases.

Cloud hosting costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increased $82.4 million for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, and personnel costs grew $60.8 million to $315.3 million for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to headcount growth. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets as a result of our recent acquisitions. Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, tariff costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. For sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above.

Subscription and support gross margin decreased for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in costs to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets as a result of our recent acquisitions, partially offset by increased leverage of our global customer support organization. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. In response to COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy and limited employee travel beginning in March 2020. Further, we have canceled in-person events and either replaced them with virtual events or postponed them to future periods. Although we did not conduct any employee layoffs related to COVID-19, we slowed hiring in our third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As of July 31, 2020, we expect to recognize approximately $1.5 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in allocated costs.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our sales presence internationally. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our international presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The remaining increase was driven by an increase in costs associated with marketing-related activities, including costs to cancel in-person events, replace them with virtual events or postpone them to future periods due to COVID-19, and costs related to go-to-market initiatives.- 45 -Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may - 46 -Table of Contentscontinue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures.

As of July 31, 2020, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material. In June 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The 2019 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2019. During fiscal 2019, we repaid in cash $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2023 and the 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their Notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the Notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted. As of July 31, 2020, all of our 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.In September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. As of July 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. In February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. This repurchase program will expire on December 31, 2020 and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2020, $801.9 million remained available for future share repurchases under the repurchase authorization. In February 2020, our board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transaction, which was in addition to our $1.0 billion share repurchase program that our board of directors authorized in February 2019. During fiscal 2020, we completed the ASR transaction with an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders’ Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the repurchase programs. - 48 -Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:Year Ended July 31,202020192018(in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,035.7 $1,055.6 $1,038.1 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities288.0 (1,825.9)(520.0)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities673.0 (773.9)1,245.6 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$1,996.7 $(1,544.2)$1,763.7 Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19 and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events such as COVID-19. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was $1.0 billion, a slight decrease of $19.9 million compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to higher cash expenditure during fiscal 2020. The decrease was partially offset by growth of our business, as reflected by an increase in billings during fiscal 2020, and repayments of the 2019 Notes attributable to the debt discount during fiscal 2019.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2020 was $288.0 million, a change of $2.1 billion compared to fiscal 2019. The change was primarily due to lower purchases of investments, a decrease in net cash payments for business acquisitions and higher proceeds from maturities and sales of investments during fiscal 2020.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes and related transactions, repayments of the 2019 Notes, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.Cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2020 was $673.0 million, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to fiscal 2019. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.8 billion from the issuance of our 2025 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges, partially offset by an increase in repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2020. - 49 -Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2020: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore Than 5 Years(in millions)0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023$1,693.0 $— $1,693.0 $— $— 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 20252,000.0 — — 2,000.0 — Operating lease obligations453.3 72.2 132.8 102.5 145.8 Purchase obligations(1)421.9 156.8 100.1 145.0 20.0 Total(2)$4,568.2 $229.0 $1,925.9 $2,247.5 $165.8 ______________(1) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum or fixed purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud and other services with third-party providers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(2) No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2020, we had approximately $74.2 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of July 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of COVID-19. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities and, accordingly, are distinct from our subscriptions and support services, as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount we are due in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.We establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international) and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.Deferred Contract CostsWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal - 50 -Table of Contentscommissions are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Manufacturing Partner and Supplier LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.- 51 -Table of ContentsWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.Convertible Senior NotesIn accounting for the issuance of our convertible senior notes, we separate the notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature, using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes, we allocate the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are netted with the liability component and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity component of the notes in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, British pound, Singapore dollar, Israeli shekel and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2020 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2020, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 15 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 5. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international - 52 -Table of Contentsexpansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2020 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn July 2018, we issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and in June 2020, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the ""2025 Notes""). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of either series of Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 53 -",2023-12-30 20:21:24.595094

Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2021, we had end-customers in over 170 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. Our product revenue was $1.1 billion or 26.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 5.3%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in a number of form factors, including as physical, virtual, and containerized appliances. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-410, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $3.1 billion or 73.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 33.8%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewall appliances, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.We continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2021, we introduced several new offerings, including: Cortex XDR 2.5, Next Generation SD-WAN, Prisma Cloud 2.0, Enterprise DLP, 5G Security, IoT Healthcare Security, Prisma Access 2.0 and Complete Zero Trust Network Security. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that we believe fit well within our long-term strategy. For example, in September 2020, we acquired Crypsis, which we expect will expand our incident response capabilities and strengthen our Cortex strategy; in November 2020, we acquired Sinefa, which we expect will extend our Prisma Access offering; in December 2020, we acquired Expanse, which we expect will enrich our Cortex offerings and provide organizations an integrated view of the enterprise to combine external, internal, and threat data; and in March 2021, we acquired Bridgecrew, which we expect will expand our Prisma Cloud offering to deliver security across the full application lifecycle.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative - 44 -Table of Contentssystems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Impact of COVID-19 on Our BusinessWe are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in continued significant global, social, and business disruption. As described in “Impacts of COVID-19 on our Business” included in Part I, Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, we have made some changes to our business including instituting a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020 and adopting our FLEXWORK initiative in fiscal 2021, which did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.Although some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the business outlook due to COVID-19, which may curtail our end-customers’ spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained, making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus (including variants), impact on our end-customers’ spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under “Results of Operations.”July 31,20212020(in millions)Total deferred revenue$5,024.0 $3,810.2 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$3,789.4 $4,302.2 Year Ended July 31,202120202019(dollars in millions)Total revenue$4,256.1 $3,408.4 $2,899.6 Total revenue year-over-year percentage increase24.9 %17.5 %27.5 %Gross margin70.0 %70.7 %72.1 %Operating loss$(304.1)$(179.0)$(54.1)Operating margin(7.1)%(5.3)%(1.9)%Billings$5,452.2 $4,301.7 $3,489.8 Billings year-over-year percentage increase26.7 %23.3 %22.2 %Cash flow provided by operating activities$1,503.0 $1,035.7 $1,055.6 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$1,387.0 $821.3 $924.4 •Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.- 45 -Table of Contents•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:Year Ended July 31,202120202019(in millions)Billings:Total revenue$4,256.1 $3,408.4 $2,899.6 Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue1,196.1 893.3 590.2 Billings$5,452.2 $4,301.7 $3,489.8 • Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.• Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:Year Ended July 31,202120202019(in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP):Net cash provided by operating activities$1,503.0 $1,035.7 $1,055.6 Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets116.0 214.4 131.2 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$1,387.0 $821.3 $924.4 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(1,480.6)$288.0 $(1,825.9)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(1,104.0)$673.0 $(773.9)- 46 -Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. Product RevenueProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20212020Change20202019ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Product$1,120.3 $1,064.2 $56.1 5.3 %$1,064.2 $1,096.2 $(32.0)(2.9)%Product revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, largely driven by increases in software sales, reflecting increased demand for our products.Subscription and Support RevenueSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20212020Change20202019ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Subscription$1,898.8 $1,405.3 $493.5 35.1 %$1,405.3 $1,032.7 $372.6 36.1 %Support1,237.0 938.9 298.1 31.7 %938.9 770.7168.2 21.8 %Total subscription and support$3,135.8 $2,344.2 $791.6 33.8 %$2,344.2 $1,803.4 $540.8 30.0 %Subscription and support revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2021 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from both new and existing end-customers.

Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific and Japan (“APAC”) increased year-over-year for fiscal 2021 due to our increasing investment in global sales force in order to support our growth and innovation.- 48 -Table of ContentsCost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping and tariff costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate with our product revenue.

The remaining increase was largely due to increased overhead costs to support the growth of our product revenue.Cost of Subscription and Support RevenueCost of subscription and support revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, customer support and repair costs, third-party professional services costs, data center and cloud hosting service costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software development costs, and allocated costs. We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases.

Personnel costs grew $97.1 million to $412.4 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to headcount growth. Cloud hosting service costs, which support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increased $45.6 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The remaining increase was primarily due to increased outside service costs for global customer support resulting from the expansions of our customer base and product portfolio, as well as the amortization of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, tariff costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting service costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. For sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. We expect our gross margins to vary over time depending on the factors described above.

Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. In response to COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, and limited employee travel beginning in March 2020. Further, we have canceled in-person events and either replaced them with virtual events or postponed them to future periods. As of July 31, 2021, we expect to recognize approximately $2.0 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth. Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our international sales presence. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our global presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increase in personnel costs was largely due to headcount growth, partially offset by decreased travel expenses due to COVID-19. In addition, expenses increased as a result of go-to-market initiatives, including advertising, which were partially offset by a decrease in trade shows and convention expenses as in-person events were replaced with virtual events due to COVID-19. General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other - 50 -Table of Contentsconsulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. To the extent - 51 -Table of Contentswe revisit our corporate structure, it may have an impact on our tax provision.

As of July 31, 2021, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material. In June 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The 2019 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2019. During fiscal 2019, we repaid in cash $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2023 and the 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their Notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the Notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted. The sale price condition was met for the 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021, and as a result, holders may convert their 2023 Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. As of July 31, 2021, substantially all of our 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.In September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. As of July 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. In February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, and, in December 2020, our board of directors authorized a $700.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.7 billion (our “current authorization”). As of July 31, 2021, $323.9 million remained available for future share repurchases under this current authorization. On August 17, 2021, our board of directors authorized another $676.1 million increase to our current authorization, bringing the total remaining authorization for future share repurchases to $1.0 billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. The expiration date of our current authorization was extended to December 31, 2022, and this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In February 2020, our board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transaction, which was in addition to our current authorization. During fiscal 2020, we completed the ASR transaction with an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders’ Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on these repurchase programs. - 53 -Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:Year Ended July 31,202120202019(in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,503.0 $1,035.7 $1,055.6 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities(1,480.6)288.0 (1,825.9)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(1,104.0)673.0 (773.9)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(1,081.6)$1,996.7 $(1,544.2)Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19 and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events such as COVID-19. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating Activities Our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.5 billion, an increase of $467.3 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by an increase in billings, and an increase in collections during fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.Investing Activities Our investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.5 billion, a net change of $1.8 billion compared to cash provided by investing activities of $288.0 million in fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and higher purchases of investments during fiscal 2021.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.1 billion, a net change of $1.8 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of 673.0 million in fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.8 billion from the issuance of our 2025 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges during fiscal 2020. - 54 -Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2021: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore Than 5 Years(in millions)0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023$1,692.0 $— $1,692.0 $— $— 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 20252,000.0 — — 2,000.0 — Operating lease obligations426.6 78.8 134.2 116.1 97.5 Purchase obligations(1)1,831.7 251.3 609.0971.4—Total(2)$5,950.3 $330.1 $2,435.2 $3,087.5 $97.5 ______________(1) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum or fixed purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud and other services with third-party providers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.(2) No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately $80.6 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of July 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of COVID-19. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities and, accordingly, are distinct from our subscriptions and support services, as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount we are due in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.We establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international) and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.Deferred Contract CostsWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal - 55 -Table of Contentscommissions are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Manufacturing Partner and Supplier LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.- 56 -Table of ContentsWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.Convertible Senior NotesIn accounting for the issuance of our convertible senior notes, we separate the notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature, using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes, we allocate the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are netted with the liability component and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity component of the notes in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the euro, Israeli shekel, British pound, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, and Japanese yen. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2021 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2021, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 16 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 6. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international - 57 -Table of Contentsexpansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio, a movement of 10% in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at July 31, 2021 would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn July 2018, we issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and in June 2020, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic interest exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of either series of Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 58 -",2023-12-30 20:21:22.739136

Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues and new revenues as we continue to grow our end-customer base. As of July 31, 2022, we had end-customers in over 180 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include almost all of the Fortune 100 companies and a majority of the Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. Our product revenue grew to $1.4 billion or 24.8% of total revenue for fiscal 2022, representing year-over-year growth of 21.7%. Product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in a number of form factors, including as physical, virtual, and containerized appliances. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-410, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $4.1 billion or 75.2% of total revenue for fiscal 2022, representing year-over-year growth of 32.0%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewall appliances, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.We continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2022, we introduced several new offerings, including: Prisma Cloud 3.0, Prisma Access 3.0, AIOps for NGFW, PAN-OS 10.2, and Cloud NGFW for AWS.- 44 -Table of ContentsWe believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Impact of COVID-19 and Other Macroeconomic Factors on Our BusinessWe are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant global, social, and business disruption. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in our offices for a set number of days per week or completely remotely, we did not experience significant disruption in our work operations during fiscal 2022. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while working remotely.COVID-19 has affected our end-customers’ spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, impact on our end-customers’ spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. The global supply chain and the semiconductor industry are experiencing significant challenges. We have seen supply chain challenges increase, including chip and component shortages, which have, in certain cases, caused delays for us in acquiring chips, components and inventory and have resulted in increased costs as compared to historic levels. While we incurred increased costs and experienced increased lead time for certain product deliveries to our end-customers, we continue to work to minimize the effects from supply chain challenges. In addition, our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and other changes in economic conditions, may adversely affect our financial performance. - 45 -Table of ContentsKey Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies.

Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:Year Ended July 31,202220212020(in millions)Billings:Total revenue$5,501.5 $4,256.1 $3,408.4 Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue1,970.0 1,196.1 893.3 Billings$7,471.5 $5,452.2 $4,301.7 - 46 -Table of Contents• Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.• Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:Year Ended July 31,202220212020(in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP):Net cash provided by operating activities$1,984.7 $1,503.0 $1,035.7 Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets192.8 116.0 214.4 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$1,791.9 $1,387.0 $821.3 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(933.4)$(1,480.6)$288.0 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(806.6)$(1,104.0)$673.0 - 47 -Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. Product RevenueProduct revenue is derived from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in a number of form factors, including as physical, virtual, and containerized appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities.

Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20222021Change20212020ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Subscription$2,539.0 $1,898.8 $640.2 33.7 %$1,898.8 $1,405.3 $493.5 35.1 %Support1,599.4 1,237.0 362.4 29.3 %1,237.0 938.9298.1 31.7 %Total subscription and support$4,138.4 $3,135.8 $1,002.6 32.0 %$3,135.8 $2,344.2 $791.6 33.8 %Subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from our end-customers.

Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping and tariff costs, and shared costs. Shared costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount.

The remaining increase was primarily due to increased cloud hosting service costs to support our cloud-based subscription offerings, outside service costs for global customer support resulting from the expansions of our customer base and product portfolio, and shared costs.Gross MarginGross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting service costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. Our virtual and higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series.

Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include shared costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount to each department. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2022, we expect to recognize approximately $1.8 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and shared costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and shared costs. We continue to strategically invest in headcount and have grown our sales presence. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to grow our customer base, increase touch points with end-customers, and expand our global presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the Notes.As of July 31, 2022, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $4.7 billion were held for general corporate purposes. As of July 31, 2022, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material. DebtIn July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2023 and the 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their Notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the Notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted. The sale price condition for the Notes was met during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022, and as a result, holders may convert their Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2022. If all of the holders of the Notes converted their Notes during this period, we would be obligated to settle the $3.7 billion principal amount of the Notes in cash. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and existing sources of and access to financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2022 or hold the 2023 Notes until maturity on July 1, 2023. As of July 31, 2022, substantially all of our Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.In September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the amount of the Credit Facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. As of July 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. - 53 -Table of ContentsCapital ReturnIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. In December 2020 and August 2021, our board of directors authorized additional $700.0 million and $676.1 million increases, respectively, bringing the total authorization under this share repurchase program to $2.4 billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. The expiration date of this repurchase authorization was extended to December 31, 2022, and our repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2022, 85.0 million remained available for future share repurchases under this repurchase program. In February 2020, our board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transaction, which was in addition to our current authorization. During fiscal 2020, we completed the ASR transaction with an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders’ Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on these repurchase programs. Leases and Other Material Cash RequirementsWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for our facilities with original lease periods expiring through the year ending July 31, 2032, with the most significant leases relating to our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. As of July 31, 2022, we have total operating lease obligations of $338.4 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.As of July 31, 2022, our commitments to purchase products, components, cloud and other services totaled $2.4 billion.

We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the repayment obligations associated with our Notes, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events such as COVID-19. In addition, from time to time, we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Operating ActivitiesOur operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Our largest source of cash provided by our operations is receipts from our product revenue and subscription and support revenue.Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was $2.0 billion, an increase of $481.7 million compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by increases in billings and collections during fiscal 2022, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.- 54 -Table of ContentsCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was $933.4 million, a decrease of $547.2 million compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net cash payments for business acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in net investment purchases, sales and maturities during fiscal 2022.Financing Activities Our financing activities have consisted of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2022 was $806.6 million, a decrease of $297.4 million compared to fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2022.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future consolidated financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities and, accordingly, are distinct from our subscriptions and support services, as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount we are due in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.We establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (channel partner or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international) and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.Deferred Contract CostsWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal commissions are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.- 55 -Table of ContentsWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Manufacturing Partner and Supplier LiabilitiesWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.From time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived AssetsWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.- 56 -Table of ContentsWe evaluate purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2022 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2022, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 16 months or less which we designate as cash flow hedges to manage the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency denominated operating expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 6. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Most of the securities we invest in are subject to interest rate risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial paper, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities. To assess the interest rate risk, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio. Based on investment positions as of July 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $20.6 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Conversely, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $20.6 million increase in the fair market value of the portfolio.In July 2018, we issued $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and in June 2020, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of either series of Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 57 -",2023-12-30 20:21:16.751769

Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues and new revenues as we continue to grow our end-customer base. As of July 31, 2023, we had end-customers in over 180 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries, including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include almost all of the Fortune 100 companies and a majority of the Global 2000 companies. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. Our product revenue grew to $1.6 billion or 22.9% of total revenue for fiscal 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 15.8%. Product revenue is derived from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, SD-WAN, and the VM-Series. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-410, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.Our subscription and support revenue grew to $5.3 billion or 77.1% of total revenue for fiscal 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 28.4%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewall appliances, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.We continue to invest in innovation as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2023, we introduced several new offerings, including: Cortex XSIAM 1.0, major updates to Prisma Cloud (including three new security modules), Prisma Access 4.0, PAN-OS 11.0, Cloud NGFW for AWS, and Cloud NGFW for Azure. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that fit well within our long-term strategy. For example, in December 2022, we acquired Cider, which we expect will support our Prisma Cloud’s platform approach to securing the entire application security lifecycle from code to cloud.We believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.- 39 -Table of ContentsImpact of Macroeconomic Developments and Other Factors on Our BusinessOur overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impact on customer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, higher interest rates, slower growth, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other conditions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance. We continue to experience supply chain disruption and incur increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures. We are monitoring the tensions between China and Taiwan, and between the U.S. and China, which could have an adverse impact on our business or results of operations in future periods.Key Financial Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income (loss) and margin below under “Results of Operations.”July 31,20232022(in millions)Total deferred revenue$9,296.4 $6,994.0 Cash, cash equivalents, and investments$5,437.9 $4,686.4 Year Ended July 31,202320222021(dollars in millions)Total revenue$6,892.7 $5,501.5 $4,256.1 Total revenue year-over-year percentage increase25.3 %29.3 %24.9 %Gross margin72.3 %68.8 %70.0 %Operating income (loss)$387.3 $(188.8)$(304.1)Operating margin5.6 %(3.4)%(7.1)%Billings$9,194.4 $7,471.5 $5,452.2 Billings year-over-year percentage increase23.1 %37.0 %26.7 %Cash flow provided by operating activities$2,777.5 $1,984.7 $1,503.0 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$2,631.2 $1,791.9 $1,387.0 •Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.•Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:- 40 -Table of ContentsYear Ended July 31,202320222021(in millions)Billings:Total revenue$6,892.7 $5,501.5 $4,256.1 Add: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue2,301.7 1,970.0 1,196.1 Billings$9,194.4 $7,471.5 $5,452.2 •Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as share-based compensation costs, depreciation and amortization, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.•Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, is provided below:Year Ended July 31,202320222021(in millions)Free cash flow (non-GAAP):Net cash provided by operating activities$2,777.5 $1,984.7 $1,503.0 Less: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets146.3 192.8 116.0 Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$2,631.2 $1,791.9 $1,387.0 Net cash used in investing activities$(2,033.8)$(933.4)$(1,480.6)Net cash used in financing activities$(1,726.3)$(806.6)$(1,104.0)- 41 -Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors. PRODUCT REVENUEProduct revenue is derived from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama, SD-WAN, and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20232022Change20222021ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Product$1,578.4 $1,363.1 $215.3 15.8 %$1,363.1 $1,120.3 $242.8 21.7 %Product revenue increased for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 driven by increased demand for our new generation of hardware products, increased software revenue primarily due to a new go-to-market strategy for certain Network Security offerings and an increased demand for our VM-Series virtual firewalls, partially offset by decreased revenue from our prior generation of hardware products. SUBSCRIPTION AND SUPPORT REVENUESubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.Year Ended July 31,Year Ended July 31, 20232022Change20222021ChangeAmountAmountAmount%AmountAmountAmount% (dollars in millions)Subscription$3,335.4 $2,539.0 $796.4 31.4 %$2,539.0 $1,898.8 $640.2 33.7 %Support1,978.9 1,599.4 379.5 23.7 %1,599.4 1,237.0 362.4 29.3 %Total subscription and support$5,314.3 $4,138.4 $1,175.9 28.4 %$4,138.4 $3,135.8 $1,002.6 32.0 %Subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from our end-customers.

COST OF REVENUEOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.COST OF PRODUCT REVENUECost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners for procuring components and manufacturing our products. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping and tariff costs, and shared costs. Shared costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate with our revenue from hardware products.

Cloud hosting service costs, which support our cloud-based subscription offerings, increased $101.0 million for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Personnel costs grew $97.0 million for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to headcount growth. - 44 -Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINGross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting service costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. Our virtual and higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. We expect our gross margins to vary over time depending on the factors described above.

Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include shared costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount to each department. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. As of July 31, 2023, we expect to recognize approximately $2.0 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype-related expenses and shared costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and shared costs. We continue to strategically invest in headcount and have grown our sales presence. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to grow our customer base, increase touch points with end-customers, and expand our global presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increase in sales and marketing expense was further driven by increased costs associated with sales and marketing events and go-to-market initiatives.GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVEGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs and shared costs for our executive, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other consulting costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars over time as we increase the size of our general and administrative organizations and incur additional costs to support our business growth, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.

The increase in general and administrative expense was further driven by slightly higher reserves due to increased receivables as a result of our business growth. INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense related to our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and the 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with “2023 Notes,” the “Notes”).

We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. Our valuation allowance has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. We regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance. Due to recent profitability, a reversal of our valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions in the foreseeable future is reasonably possible.

Our effective tax rate varied for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to our profitability in fiscal 2023 and an increase in U.S. taxes driven by capitalization of research and development expenditures with no offsetting deferred benefit due to our valuation allowance. This increase was offset by releases of uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2023 resulting from tax settlements. Refer to Note 15.

As of July 31, 2023, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material.- 47 -Table of ContentsDEBTIn July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. The 2023 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2023. During fiscal 2023, we repaid in cash $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes and issued 11.4 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares we received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their 2025 Notes for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being converted. The sale price condition for the 2025 Notes was met during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2023, and as a result, holders may convert their 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2023. If all of the holders convert their 2025 Notes during this period, we would be obligated to settle the $2.0 billion principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and existing sources of and access to financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2023 or hold the 2025 Notes until maturity on June 1, 2025. As of July 31, 2023, substantially all of our 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.In April 2023, we entered into a new credit agreement (the “2023 Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2023 Credit Facility”), with an option to increase the amount of the 2023 Credit Facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. The interest rates and commitment fees are also subject to upward and downward adjustments based on our progress towards the achievement of certain sustainability goals related to greenhouse gas emissions. As of July 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the 2023 Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement. CAPITAL RETURNIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program. In December 2020, August 2021, and August 2022, our board of directors authorized additional $700.0 million, $676.1 million, and $915.0 million increases to this share repurchase program, respectively, bringing the total authorization under this share repurchase program to $3.3 billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time. The expiration date of this repurchase authorization was extended to December 31, 2023, and our repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of July 31, 2023, $750.0 million remained available for future share repurchases under this repurchase program. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders’ Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on these repurchase programs. LEASES AND OTHER MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTSWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating leases primarily for our facilities with original lease periods expiring through the year ending July 31, 2033, with the most significant leases relating to our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. As of July 31, 2023, we have total operating lease obligations of $339.4 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.As of July 31, 2023, our commitments to purchase products, components, cloud and other services totaled $1.8 billion.

We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the repayment obligations associated with our Notes, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events. In addition, from time to time, we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.We may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.OPERATING ACTIVITIESOur operating activities have consisted of net income (losses) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Our largest source of cash provided by our operations is receipts from our billings.Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 was $2.8 billion, an increase of $792.8 million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by increases in collections during fiscal 2023, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.INVESTING ACTIVITIESOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2023 was $2.0 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in purchases of investments and an increase in net cash payments for business acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments during fiscal 2023.FINANCING ACTIVITIES Our financing activities have consisted of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2023 was $1.7 billion, an increase of $919.7 million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to repayments of our 2023 Notes upon maturity, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2023.Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future consolidated financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.- 49 -Table of ContentsREVENUE RECOGNITIONThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities. Accordingly, these appliances and software licenses are distinct from our subscriptions and support services as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.We establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (channel partner or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international), and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.INCOME TAXESWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for all future benefits including, but not limited to, net operating losses, research and development credit carryforwards, and basis differences relating to our global intangible low-taxed income. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.MANUFACTURING PARTNER AND SUPPLIER LIABILITIESWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Through July 31, 2023, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.LOSS CONTINGENCIESWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible, then we disclose the possible loss or range of the possible loss or state that such an estimate cannot be made. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.- 50 -Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses. Refer to the “Litigation” subheading in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our litigation.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. A portion of our operating expenditures are incurred outside of the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at July 31, 2023 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. As of July 31, 2023, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 24 months or less, which we designate as cash flow hedges, to manage the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency denominated operating expenditures. The effectiveness of our existing hedging transactions and the availability and effectiveness of any hedging transactions we may decide to enter into in the future may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Refer to Note 6. Derivative Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.As our international operations grow, our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will become greater, and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk. In addition, a weakening U.S. dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion and a strengthening U.S. dollar can increase the real cost of our products and services to our end-customers outside of the United States, leading to delays in the purchase of our products and services. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Most of the securities we invest in are subject to interest rate risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain a diversified portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, consisting only of investment-grade securities. To assess the interest rate risk, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio. Based on investment positions as of July 31, 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $55.5 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity. Conversely, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $55.5 million increase in the fair market value of the portfolio.In June 2020, we issued $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. As these instruments have a fixed annual interest rate, we have no financial and economic exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate debt instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and additionally, in the case of the 2025 Notes, when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.- 51 -Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:21:19.741039
