731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, whose mission is to help people live healthier lives and help make health care work better. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data, information and intelligence; and care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. 29Table of ContentsUnitedHealthcare serves the health benefits needs of individuals across life's stages through three businesses. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual serves individual consumers and employers. The unique health needs of seniors are served by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement. UnitedHealthcare Community & State serves the public health marketplace, offering states innovative Medicaid solutions.Optum serves health system participants including consumers, physicians, hospitals, governments, insurers, distributors and pharmaceutical companies, through its OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx businesses.RevenuesOur revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs. Effective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and implementing regulations, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, subject to state-specific exceptions) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. As a result, our quarterly premium revenue may be reduced by a pro rata estimate of our full-year premium rebate payable under the Health Reform Legislation. Any required rebate payments for the current year are made in the third quarter of the subsequent year. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from our Optum businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities; investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired.Operating CostsMedical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders.Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods.Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, rebates, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio.Cash FlowsWe generate cash primarily from premiums, service and product revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs, payments on debt, purchases of investments, acquisitions, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. For more information on our cash flows, see “Liquidity” below.Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 18% of U.S. gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of 30Table of Contentsoperations. In 2012, we expect increasing unit costs to continue to be the primary cost driver of medical cost trends and we project steadily increasing medical system utilization over the course of the year. We also expect an increase in prescription drug costs. We will continue to work to manage medical cost trends through care management programs, affordable network relationships, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers, and targeted clinical management programs and initiatives focused on improving quality and affordability. Additionally, employers are continuing to select products with benefit designs that shift more of the costs to the employee. This cost shifting continues to mitigate increases in medical cost trends. Our businesses focus on affordability, consumer empowerment, wellness and prevention, payment innovations, and enhanced distribution to better serve our customer and consumer needs and demands. These business objectives are consistent with the goals of health care reform. We expect that the portion of our costs that is tied to incentive contracts that reward providers for outcome-based results and improved cost efficiencies will continue to increase. Care providers are facing market pressures to change from fee-for-service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer, integrated care across care providers and pay-for-performance payment structures. This is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems. The impact of such changes on our results of operations is uncertain but, we expect them to moderate the rate at which medical costs increase. This trend also provides growth opportunities for our OptumHealth and OptumInsight businesses. We attempt to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, competitive dynamics and premium rebates at the local market level. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs and Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. In 2012, we continue to expect reimbursements to be under pressure through government payment rates and continued market competition in commercial products.Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesIn the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. HHS, the DOL, the IRS and the Treasury Department have issued or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation, all of which have a variety of effective dates, remain pending.The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth and restrict premium rate increases in certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs, or expose us to an increased risk of liability, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.We also anticipate that the Health Reform Legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality, with a focus on prevention, wellness and disease management. We believe demand for many of our service offerings, such as consulting services, data management, information technology and related infrastructure construction, disease management, and population-based health and wellness programs will continue to grow.Following is a listing of some of the key provisions of the Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items along with management's view of the related trends and uncertainties that may cause reported financial information to not be indicative of future operating performance or of future financial condition.Premium RebatesEffective in 2011, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. The potential for and size of the rebates are measured by state, by group size and by licensed subsidiary.In the aggregate, the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained.The disaggregation of insurance pools into smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in the estimates of rebates owed. Other market participants could implement changes to their business practices in response to the Health Reform Legislation, which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share. Insurers could elect to change pricing, modify product features or benefits, adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market. They could also seek to adjust 31Table of Contentstheir operating costs by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services. We have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to the Health Reform Legislation, including reducing producer commissions, and are implementing changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment. These changes could impact future growth in these products. Commercial Rate Increase ReviewThe Health Reform Legislation also requires HHS to maintain an annual review of “unreasonable” increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% (with state-specific thresholds to be applicable commencing September 2012), and clarified that the HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The regulations further require commercial health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10% (or applicable state threshold) or more. Under the regulations, the HHS rate review process would apply only to health plans in the individual and small group markets.The Federal government is also encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases by affected commercial health plans (including large group plans) and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. Since August 2010, HHS has allocated approximately $250 million for grants to states to enable the states to conduct more robust reviews of requests for premium increases. Many states have applied for and received grants, and state regulators have signaled their intent to more closely scrutinize premium rates.Premium rate review legislation (ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements) has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states in 2011. As a result, we have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California, New York and Rhode Island. Depending on the level of scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression.Medicare Advantage RatesAs part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage risk adjusted benchmarks, which ultimately drive our CMS payments, were reduced by 1.6% in 2011 from 2010 levels. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks have taken effect (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. These changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels.We expect the 2012 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. There are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, adjust members' benefits and decide on a county-by-county basis in which geographies to participate.Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the increases in the number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement insurance offerings.It is also anticipated that CMS will release the final Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit methodology in 2012. RADV audits are intended to validate that the risk-adjusted payments Medicare Advantage plans receive are supported by medical record data. Depending upon the final RADV methodology released by CMS, recoveries from RADV audits may result in additional rate pressure. Budget Control Act's Medicare SequestrationCongress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, following the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to cut the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion, triggers automatic across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration), including Medicare spending cuts averaging 2% of total program costs for nine years, starting in 2013. Medicare payments exempted from sequestration include:•Part D low-income subsidies;•Part D catastrophic subsidies; and •Payments to states for coverage of Medicare cost-sharing for certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries.32Table of ContentsThe Office of Management and Budget is responsible for determining, calculating and implementing cuts. We are exploring strategies to mitigate any impact that may result from the cuts beginning in 2013. Insurance Industry FeeThe Health Reform Legislation includes an annual insurance industry assessment ($8 billion levied on the insurance industry in 2014 with increasing annual amounts thereafter). The annual fee will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity's net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions and uncertainties.Our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 due to the non-deductibility of these fees. Premium increases will be necessary to offset the impact of these and other provisions. Premium increases are generally subject to state regulatory approval and potentially to federal review. Other market participants could increase premiums at different levels which could impact our market share positively or negatively.State-based Exchanges and Coverage ExpansionEffective in 2014, exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers as well as certain CHIP eligibles. The exchanges will be state-based. If a state fails to establish an exchange by the required deadline, exchanges may be administered through a federal/state partnership or by the federal government. Among other things, the Health Reform Legislation eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits and restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded. The Health Reform Legislation also provides for expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. The Health Reform Legislation includes an MOE provision that requires states to maintain their eligibility rules for people covered by Medicaid, until the Secretary of HHS determines that an insurance exchange is operational in a given state. The MOE provision is intended to prevent states from reducing eligibility standards and determination procedures as a way to remove adults above 133% of the federal poverty level from Medicaid before implementation of expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. However, states with, or projecting, a budget deficit may apply for an exception to the MOE provision. Additionally, individual states may accelerate their procurement of Medicaid managed care services in 2012 and 2013 for sizeable groups of Medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads in advance of Medicaid market expansion taking place in 2014. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that up to 34 million additional individuals may eventually gain insurance coverage if the Health Reform Legislation is implemented broadly in its current form. This represents an opportunity for us to increase membership. However, serving these individuals may generate different profit margins than our existing business due to various factors, including the health status of the newly insured individuals.We expect existing participants in Medicare and Medicaid and new enrollees in state-based exchanges to transition between products and programs, offering us opportunities to design products and services that enable us to compete for new business across business segments on an ongoing basis. An acceleration of Medicaid managed care services could increase near-term business growth opportunities for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. However, if states are successful in obtaining MOE waivers and allow certain Medicaid programs to expire, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment. Court ProceedingsCourt proceedings related to the Health Reform Legislation continue to evolve. These court proceedings, and the potential for Congressional action to impede implementation, create additional uncertainties with respect to the law.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY ITEMSThe following represents a summary of selected 2011 operating and liquidity items. These matters should not be considered by themselves; see below for further discussion and analysis.•Consolidated total revenues of $102 billion increased 8% over 2010.•UnitedHealthcare revenues of $95 billion rose 7% over 2010.•Optum revenues of $29 billion increased 21% over 2010.•UnitedHealthcare enrollment during 2011 grew by 1.6 million people in 2011. •Consolidated medical care ratio of 80.8% increased 20 basis points over 2010.•Net earnings of $5 billion and diluted earnings per share of $4.73 are up 11% and 15%, respectively over 2010. •Return on Equity of 18.9% increased 20 basis points over 2010.•Operating cash flows of $7 billion rose 11% over 2010.•Liquidity:◦Extended our credit agreement to December 2016 and increased capacity to $3 billion.◦2011 debt offerings raised new debt totaling $2.25 billion.◦Debt to debt-plus-equity ratio decreased 100 basis points from 2010 to 29.1%.34Table of Contents2011 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2010 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our UnitedHealthcare businesses, commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all Optum businesses.Medical CostsMedical costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use, and a modest increase in health system utilization, mainly in outpatient and physician office settings. Unit cost increases represented the majority of the increases in our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2011 and 2010 there was $720 million and $800 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels. The favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. Operating CostsThe increase in our operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to business growth, including an increased mix of Optum and UnitedHealthcare fee-based and service revenues, which have higher operating costs, and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance. These factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment.Income Tax RateThe effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010, due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the Health Reform Legislation.Reportable SegmentsOur two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, are comprised of four reportable segments:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of our reportable segments derives its revenues.Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and clinical services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.35Table of ContentsOn January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2011 presentation.

In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, we estimate that we entered January 2012 down approximately 625,000 people, primarily as a result of the loss of approximately 470,000 of our auto-assigned low-income subsidy Medicare Part D beneficiaries in a number of regions being automatically reassigned to other plans as part of the annual bid process managed by CMS. We believe that we will grow from this level throughout the course of the year in the open retail market.In February 2012, we added 117,000 Medicare Advantage members from the acquisition of XLHealth Corporation.Optum. Total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at OptumHealth and OptumInsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at OptumRx.Optum’s operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was down compared to 2010. The decrease was due to changes in business mix within Optum’s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthIncreased revenues at OptumHealth for the year ended December 31, 2011 were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services, as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings. Earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 and operating margin decreased compared to 2010. The decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services.OptumInsightIncreased revenues at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2011 were due to the impact of organic growth and the full-year impact of 2010 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in June 2011.The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment.37Table of ContentsOptumRxThe increase in OptumRx revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 was due to increased prescription volumes, primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business, and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $16.7 billion and $14.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and Medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications.We will consolidate and manage the majority of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs internally when our contract with Medco Health Solutions, Inc. expires at the end of 2012. The investments in our infrastructure and to expand our capacity will likely cause a decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin as in 2012, OptumRx expects to absorb approximately $115 million of the $150 million consolidated in-sourcing related operating costs. As a result of this transition, OptumRx expects to add 12 million members on a staged basis in 2013. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks associated with the transition of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs to OptumRx.2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2009 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results RevenuesThe increases in revenues for 2010 were primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based benefit offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth.Medical Costs and Medical Care RatioMedical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs. For 2010 and 2009, there was $800 million and $310 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years.The medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services, successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously.Operating CostsOperating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses, goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at OptumInsight, which is discussed in more detail below, an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the Medicare Advantage annual enrollment period, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs.Income Tax RateThe increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation due to the Health Reform Legislation.Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareThe revenue growth in UnitedHealthcare for 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases. UnitedHealthcare earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above, continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental 38Table of Contentscustomers, a general moderation in year-over-year growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs.OptumHealthIncreased revenues in OptumHealth for 2010 were primarily driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets. The operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the federal Mental Health Parity & Addiction Equity Act of 2008.OptumInsightIncreased revenues in OptumInsight for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance. The decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. In addition, increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment.OptumRxThe increased OptumRx revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business and higher prescription volumes. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $14.4 billion and $12.5 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. OptumRx operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management.LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. The risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses, geographies and customers; our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses; and continued productivity improvements that lower our operating costs.Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment-grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors' approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital through risk tolerances around liquidity, credit quality, issuer limits, asset class diversification, income and duration. The policy emphasizes investment grade bonds with durations that are short to intermediate term in nature. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations and tax implications. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval.39Table of ContentsIn 2011, based on the 2010 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion, including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion, including $686 million of extraordinary dividends.Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash For the Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 2011 2010 2009Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $6,968 $6,273 $5,625Issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 346 94 —Interest rate swap termination 132 — 513Proceeds from customer funds administered 37 974 204Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases — — 249Other 640 292 304Total sources of cash 8,123 7,633 6,895Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (2,994) (2,517) (1,801)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,695) (2,157) —Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions (1,459) (2,304) (486)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net of dispositions (1,018) (878) (739)Dividends paid (651) (449) (36)Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper — — (1,449)Other — (5) (10)Total uses of cash (7,817) (8,310) (4,521)Net increase (decrease) in cash $306 $(677) $2,3742011 Cash Flows Compared to 2010 Cash FlowsCash flows from operating activities increased $695 million, or 11%, from 2010. The increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts, which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state Medicaid premium payments in 2010, which increased 2010 cash from operating activities. We anticipate lower year over year cash flows from operations in 2012, which will include payments in the third quarter for 2011 premium rebate obligations. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion, or 22%, primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments. We anticipate an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in 2012 as compared to 2011.Cash flows used for financing activities increased $879 million, or 55%, primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings.2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $648 million, or 12%, for 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments, and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections, which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program and payment for the settlement of the American Medical Association class action litigation 40Table of Contentsrelated to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010, decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and the use of operating cash to purchase investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $664 million, or 29%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock. Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.0 billion included $9.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.6 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $18.0 billion of debt securities and $544 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. We had $417 million of Level 3 securities as of December 31, 2011. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $3.0 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements.Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2011. Included in the debt securities balance are $2.4 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of December 31, 2011. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $3.0 billion bank credit facility described below. As of December 31, 2011, we had no commercial paper outstanding.Bank Credit Facility. In December 2011, we amended and renewed our five-year revolving bank credit facility with 21 banks, which will mature in December 2016. The amendment included increasing the borrowing capacity to $3.0 billion. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2011. The interest rate on borrowings is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2011, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 1.2% to 1.7%.Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio below 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity, was 29.1% and 30.1% as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2011.Long-term debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes and the funds may be used, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions, for share repurchases or for other general corporate purposes.In November 2011, we issued $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $400 million of 1.9% fixed-rate notes due November 2016, $500 million of 3.4% fixed-rate notes due November 2021 and $600 million of 4.6% notes due November 2041.In February 2011, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $400 million of 4.7% fixed-rate 41Table of Contentsnotes due February 2021 and $350 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due February 2041. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A- Positive A- Stable bbb+ StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-2 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured repurchase programs), subject to certain preset parameters established by our Board. In May 2011, our Board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased 65 million shares at an average price of approximately $46 per share and an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion. As of December 31, 2011, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 65 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In May 2011, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.65 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2010, we had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. On February 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1625 per share.The following table provides details of our dividend payments and annual dividend rate:Years ended December 31, Amount Paid per Share Total Amount Paid Annual Dividend Rate per Share at December 31, (in millions) 2009 $0.0300 $36 $0.032010 0.4050 449 0.502011 0.6125 651 0.6542Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2011, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2012 2013 to 2014 2015 to 2016 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $1,580 $2,551 $2,437 $13,529 $20,097Operating leases 279 455 303 564 1,601Purchase obligations (b) 180 105 34 1 320Future policy benefits (c) 125 257 271 1,917 2,570Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 9 — — 108 117Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 203 7 — 2,459 2,669Other obligations (f) 101 66 122 32 321Total contractual obligations $2,477 $3,441 $3,167 $18,610 $27,695(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values.

(c)Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (d)As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.”(e)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(f)Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2011, we were not involved in off-balance sheet arrangements which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn July 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06, “Other Expenses (Topic 720): Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (ASU 2011-06). This update addresses the recognition and classification of an entity's share of the annual health insurance industry assessment (the fee) mandated by Health Reform Legislation. The fee will be levied on health insurers for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The fee will be allocated to health insurers based on the ratio of an entity's net health premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance for any U.S. health risk that is written during the preceding calendar year. In accordance with the amendments in ASU 2011-06, our liability for the fee will be estimated and recorded in full once we provide qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable (first applicable in 2014) with a corresponding deferred cost that will be amortized to expense using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable. We have determined that there have been no other recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.43Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2011, 2010 and 2009, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $720 million, $800 million and $310 million, respectively. This development represented approximately 8%, 9% and 4% of the medical claims payable balance as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted. 44Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2011: Completion FactorsIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $211(0.50) 141(0.25) 700.25 (70)0.50 (139)0.75 (208)Medical cost PMPM trend factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2011: Medical Costs PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $4152 2771 138(1) (138)(2) (277)(3) (415)The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management's best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2011, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2011; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2011 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2011 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $56 million and diluted net earnings per common share would have increased or decreased by $0.05 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable 45Table of Contentsregulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Effective in 2011, premium revenue subject to the premium rebates of the Health Reform Legislation are recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract, when that amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated premium is revised each period to reflect current experience. The most significant factors in estimating these rebates are financial performance within each aggregation set, including medical claim experience and effective tax rates, as well as changes in business mix and regulatory requirements. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. Our Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS' risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and other health care plans collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS' retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Medicare Advantage risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits.Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategy. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions around unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated.•Medical cost trends. See further discussion of medical costs trends within Medical Costs above. Similar factors are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. •Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives.•Capital levels. The capital structure and requirements for each business is considered.Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the 46Table of Contentslong-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation”. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Part I and ""Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties"" above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit based on the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units' operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future.We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2012. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values, thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2011. Intangible assets. Finite-lived, separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). We do not have material holdings of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values and are then amortized over their expected useful lives. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles which represent 88% of our total intangible balance of $2.8 billion.Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rate, perpetuity growth rate and discount rate. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested).Our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of an intangible asset, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. There were no material impairments of finite-lived intangible assets during 2011.Investments As of December 31, 2011, we had investments with a carrying value of $18.7 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders' equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2011, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $787 million and gross unrealized losses of $32 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering factors including:•our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost;•the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost; and•the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer.47Table of ContentsFor debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security's cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in through our income statement. Inherently, there is uncertainty included in the impairment assessment of investments. Our analysis includes significant judgments and estimates including: the fair value of the investment, the underlying credit quality of the issuers and the credit ratings of the issuer other forms of credit enhancements, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and general industry and sector economic conditions. Fair values. We perform an analysis around the fair values of the securities held including obtaining an understanding of the pricing method and procedures over the valuation of securities. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare:•the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, its custodian, its investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and•changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-than-temporary impairment assessment. Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the factors above including: the length of time of impairment, credit standing, financial condition, near term-prospects and other factors specific to the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, the primary causes of historical impairments were market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations, etc) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Generally, we do not assume that we will be required to sell a security because our large cash holdings reduce this risk. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $12 million, $23 million and $64 million, respectively. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2011. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial 48Table of Contentscondition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"" a 1% increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $622 million.Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence (both positive and negative) for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2011 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $80 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of probable costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference in this report.49Table of ContentsCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2011, we had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A+.” As of December 31, 2011, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.As of December 31, 2011, $9.4 billion of our investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, OptumHealth Bank held $1.4 billion of deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2011 at interest rates that vary with market rates.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, $18.2 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $11.6 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts. In the second half of 2011, we terminated all of our interest rate swap fair value hedges with a $5.4 billion notional amount in order to lock-in the impact of low market floating interest rates and reduce the effective interest rate on hedged long-term debt. The gain of $132 million will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixed-rate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additional information on our interest rate swaps is included in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the interest rate swaps have been terminated, the fair value of our long-term debt is now more sensitive to hypothetical changes in interest rates as the change in the fair value of the debt is no longer offset by the swaps. Also as a result of the swaps' termination, our exposure to hypothetical changes in market rates on our interest expense is less volatile.50Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions): December 31, 2011Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofInvestments (b) Fair Value ofDebt2 % $199 $28 $(1,239) $(1,946)1 99 14 (622) (1,082)(1) (12) (4) 586 1,086(2) nm nm 885 2,343 December 31, 2010Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofInvestments Fair Value ofDebt2 % $182 $163 $(1,177) $(860)1 91 82 (602) (471)(1) (10) (21) 613 560(2) nm nm 1,227 1,240nm = not meaningful (a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 2% point reduction is not meaningful.(b)As of December 31, 2011, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 2% point reduction.As of December 31, 2011, we had $544 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:43.794029
731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making health care work better. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services. Further information on our business is included in Item 1, “Business” and additional information on the our segments can be found in this Item 7 and in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements.”RevenuesOur revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from our Optum businesses relating to care management, consumer engagement and support, distribution of benefits and services, health financial services, operational services and support, health care information technology and pharmacy services. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our pharmacy benefit management business. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities; investment income also includes gains or losses when investment securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired.Pricing Trends. We seek to price our products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, competitive dynamics, cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of Health Reform Legislation and premium rebates at the local market level. We endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business. Changes in business mix and Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. Further, we continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure through continued market competition in commercial products and government payment rates. Aggregating UnitedHealthcare’s businesses, we expect the medical care ratio to rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the health benefit exchange market in 2014.In the commercial market segment, we expect pricing to continue to be highly competitive in 2013. We plan to hold to our pricing disciplines and, considering the competitive environment and persistently weak employment and new business formation rates, we expect continued pressure on our commercial risk-based product membership in 2013. Additionally, self-insured membership as a percent of total commercial membership is expected to continue to increase at a modest pace in 2013 and beyond, due in part to the emerging popularity of midsize employers moving to self-funded arrangements.In government programs, we are seeing continuing rate pressures, and rate changes for some Medicaid programs are slightly negative. Unlike in prior years, recent Medicaid reductions have generally not been mitigated by corresponding benefit reductions or care provider fee schedule reductions by the state sponsor. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing Medicaid contracts. Medicare funding is similarly pressured; see further discussion below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect these factors to result in pressure on gross margin percentages for our Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2013.In 2013, UnitedHealthcare created a new affordable “Basic Plan” for Medicare Part D consumers and reclassified its large 4 million member Medicare Part D plan to an “Enhanced Plan” status with CMS. The change to Enhanced Plan status changes the seasonal pattern of earnings to later in the year with no material impact expected on full year profitability.32Table of ContentsOperating CostsMedical Costs. Medical costs represent the costs of our obligations for claims and/or benefits of our risk-based insurance arrangements. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders.Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have not yet received or processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods.Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, rebates, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. Medical Cost Trends. In 2012, we managed our commercial medical cost trend to a level under 5.5 percent. In 2013, we expect a slight increase in trend from 2012, albeit with relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2012. We expect our total trend will be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers as they try to compensate for soft utilization trends and cross-subsidization pressure due to their government reimbursement levels. Underlying utilization trends declined significantly in 2010 and increased modestly in 2011 and 2012. Use of outpatient services has been the primary driver of utilization trend increase, with inpatient utilization declining. We also experienced an increase in prescription drug costs in 2012 and expect that trend to continue due to unit cost pressure and a trend towards expensive new specialty drugs. As we move into 2013, we believe current utilization trends are slightly below what we believe to be normal utilization levels. The weak economic environment, combined with our medical cost management, has had a favorable impact on utilization trends. We believe our alignment of progressive benefit designs, consumer engagement, clinical management, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers and network resources is favorably controlling medical and pharmacy costs, enhancing affordability and quality for our customers and members and helping to drive strong market response and growth. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses or an increase in the delivery of medical services on an integrated basis may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio.Other Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other health economies. In the U.S., health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including in the U.S. enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. These factors are creating market pressures to change from fee-for-service models to new delivery models focused on the holistic health of the consumer, integrated care across care providers and pay-for-performance payment structures. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve the overall care for people, improve the health of a population and reduce the cost of care. The focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. We have seen increased participation in incentive-based payment models such as pay for performance, shared savings, bundled/episode payment and Patient-Centered Medical Home models (PCMHs). We also have seen continued development and deployment of risk-based accountable care models designed to modernize local delivery systems by better coordinating care, reducing the fragmentation of treatments between multiple care providers in the current system, limiting unnecessary hospital admissions and readmissions, focusing on preventive care, breaking down reimbursement and treatment “silos,” and improving quality and outcomes.33Table of ContentsThis trend is creating the need for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, providing growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Government Reliance on Private Sector. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector solutions. We expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible, better managed, higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs. States are struggling to balance unprecedented budget pressures with increases in their Medicaid expenditures. At the same time, many are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs. More and more, Medicaid managed care is being viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs. Additionally, there are more than nine million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. Dually eligible beneficiaries typically have complex conditions with costs of care that are far higher than a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. While these individuals’ health needs are more complex and more costly, they have historically been in unmanaged environments. This provides UnitedHealthcare an opportunity to integrate Medicare and Medicaid financing to fund efforts to optimize the health status of this frail population through close coordination of care. As of December 31, 2012, UnitedHealthcare served more than 250,000 members in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare Community & State will help implement Ohio’s MME program, one of the first in the country under the new CMS design. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items; for additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation and Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties, see Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Commercial Rate Increase Review. The Health Reform Legislation requires HHS to maintain an annual review of “unreasonable” increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS established a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10% and clarified that HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval procedures. Premium rate review legislation (ranging from new or enhanced rate filing requirements to prior approval requirements) has been introduced or passed in more than half of the states as of the date of this report. The competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience a tight, competitive commercial pricing environment. Further, our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practices. We anticipate requesting rate increases above 10% in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform. We have begun to experience greater regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. Depending on the level of scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression in the commercial health benefits business. Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage pricing benchmarks have been cut over the last several years and additional cuts were implemented in 2012, with changes to continue to be phased in over the next one to five years (benchmarks will ultimately range from 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), depending on the level of benchmark reduction in a county. Additionally, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, would trigger automatic across-the-board budget cuts (sequestration), including a reduction in outlays for Medicare starting in March 2013, absent further Congressional action. Further, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage plans will be required to have a minimum medical loss ratio of 85%. CMS has not yet issued guidance as to how this requirement will be calculated for Medicare Advantage plans. A significant portion of our network contracts are tied to Medicare reimbursement levels. However, future Medicare Advantage rates may be outpaced by underlying medical cost trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. There are a number of annual adjustments we can and are making to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, adjust members’ benefits and decide on a county-by-county basis in which geographies to participate. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses that may offset these anticipated rate reductions. The expanded stars bonus program is set to expire in 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans per PPACA (compared to current bonuses that are available to certain qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher). Approximately 60% and 10% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and 4 stars or 34Table of Contentshigher, respectively for the 2014 payment year based on scoring released by CMS in October 2012. Updated scores, to be released in October 2013, will determine what portion of our Medicare Advantage membership will reside in a 4 star or 5 star plan and qualify for quality bonus payments in 2015. Although we are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings, if we are unable to significantly increase the level of membership in plans with a rating of 4 stars or higher for the 2015 payment year, our 2015 results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Compared to 2011, our 2012 Medicare Advantage membership has increased by 400,000 consumers, or 18%, including acquisitions. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance offerings.Industry Fees and Taxes. The Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, non-deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based products, beginning January 1, 2014. The amount of the annual tax is $8 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will be equal to the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual tax will be allocated based on the ratio of an entity’s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry’s net premiums written for any U.S. health risk-based products during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. This tax will first be paid and expensed in 2014; however, because our policies are annual, we have included the tax and other Health Reform Legislation cost factors in our 2013 rate filings relating to 2014 rate periods and any related premium increases for 2013 policies that have coverage into 2014 will increase the amount of premium recognized in 2013. Our effective income tax rate will increase significantly in 2014 as a result of the non-deductibility of these taxes.With the introduction of state health insurance exchanges in 2014, the Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs are: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program which will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements ($25 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2014 of which $20 billion (subject to increases based on state decisions) will fund the state reinsurance pools and $5 billion funds the U.S. Treasury). The terms of the specific reinsurance programs to be used in each state are not yet known.It is our intention to pass these taxes and fees on to customers through increases in rates and/or decreases in benefits, subject to regulatory approval.State-Based Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. Effective in 2014, state-based exchanges are required to be established for individuals and small employers with enrollment processes scheduled to commence in October of 2013. We expect to selectively respond and participate in exchanges as they are introduced to the market. Our level of participation in state-based exchanges will be driven by how we assess each local market’s current and future prospects, including how the exchange and its rules are set up state-by-state and, our market position relative to others in the market. Our participation will likely evolve and change over time as the exchange markets mature. Exchanges will create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market, its pace and its impact on our established membership. For example, certain small employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and larger employers may elect to convert their benefit plans from risk-based to self-funded programs. The Health Reform Legislation also provides for expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. These measures remain subject to implementation at the state level. Individual & Small Group Market Reforms. The Health Reform Legislation includes several provisions that will take effect on January 1, 2014 and are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace. Although HHS issued proposed regulations in late 2012, these regulations are not yet final. Key provisions include: (1) adjusted community rating requirements, which will change how individual and small group plans are rated in many states and are expected to result in significant adjustments in some policyholders’ rates during the transition period; (2) essential health benefit requirements, which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders and will also impact rates; and (3) actuarial value requirements, which will significantly impact benefit designs (e.g. member cost sharing requirements) and could also significantly impact rates for some policyholders. 35Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARY For the Years Ended December 31,Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions, except percentages and per share data) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Revenues: Premiums $99,728 $91,983 $85,405 $7,745 8% $6,578 8%Services 7,437 6,613 5,819 824 12 794 14Products 2,773 2,612 2,322 161 6 290 12Investment and other income 680 654 609 26 4 45 7Total revenues 110,618 101,862 94,155 8,756 9 7,707 8Operating costs: Medical costs 80,226 74,332 68,841 5,894 8 5,491 8Operating costs 17,306 15,557 14,270 1,749 11 1,287 9Cost of products sold 2,523 2,385 2,116 138 6 269 13Depreciation and amortization 1,309 1,124 1,064 185 16 60 6Total operating costs 101,364 93,398 86,291 7,966 9 7,107 8Earnings from operations 9,254 8,464 7,864 790 9 600 8Interest expense (632) (505) (481) 127 25 24 5Earnings before income taxes 8,622 7,959 7,383 663 8 576 8Provision for income taxes (3,096) (2,817) (2,749) 279 10 68 2Net earnings $5,526 $5,142 $4,634 $384 7% $508 11%Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $5.28 $4.73 $4.10 $0.55 12% $0.63 15%Medical care ratio (a) 80.4% 80.8% 80.6% (0.4)% 0.2 % Operating cost ratio 15.6 15.3 15.2 0.3 0.1 Operating margin 8.4 8.3 8.4 0.1 (0.1) Tax rate 35.9 35.4 37.2 0.5 (1.8) Net margin 5.0 5.0 4.9 — 0.1 Return on equity (b) 18.7% 18.9% 18.7% (0.2)% 0.2 % (a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings divided by average equity.

See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail on Amil.•We repurchased 57 million shares for $3.1 billion and paid dividends of $0.8 billion. 2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesRevenue increases in 2012 were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our UnitedHealthcare businesses and growth in our Optum health service and technology offerings.Medical CostsMedical costs increased in 2012 due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses, unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use, partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development. Unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. Operating CostsThe increases in our operating costs for 2012 were due to business growth, including increases in revenues from UnitedHealthcare fee-based benefits and Optum services, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, as well as investments in the OptumRx pharmacy management services and UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans businesses. Income Tax RateThe increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011, which lowered the 2011 effective income tax rate. Reportable SegmentsWe have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State, and UnitedHealthcare International;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” and Item 1, “Business” for a description of how each of our reportable segments derives its revenues.Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by OptumRx, certain product offerings and care management and integrated care delivery services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumHealth, and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by OptumInsight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation.37Table of ContentsThe following table presents reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Revenues UnitedHealthcare $103,419 $95,336 $88,730 $8,083 8% $6,606 7%OptumHealth 8,147 6,704 4,565 1,443 22 2,139 47OptumInsight 2,882 2,671 2,342 211 8 329 14OptumRx 18,359 19,278 16,724 (919) (5) 2,554 15Total Optum 29,388 28,653 23,631 735 3 5,022 21Eliminations (22,189) (22,127) (18,206) 62 — 3,921 22Consolidated revenues $110,618 $101,862 $94,155 $8,756 9% $7,707 8%Earnings from operations UnitedHealthcare $7,815 $7,203 $6,740 $612 8 % $463 7 %OptumHealth 561 423 511 138 33 (88) (17)OptumInsight 485 381 84 104 27 297 354OptumRx 393 457 529 (64) (14) (72) (14)Total Optum 1,439 1,261 1,124 178 14 137 12Consolidated earnings from operations $9,254 $8,464 $7,864 $790 9 % $600 8 %Operating margin UnitedHealthcare 7.6% 7.6% 7.6% — % — % OptumHealth 6.9 6.3 11.2 0.6 (4.9) OptumInsight 16.8 14.3 3.6 2.5 10.7 OptumRx 2.1 2.4 3.2 (0.3) (0.8) Total Optum 4.9 4.4 4.8 0.5 (0.4) Consolidated operating margin 8.4% 8.3% 8.4% 0.1 % (0.1)% UnitedHealthcareThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenue by business: For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions, except percentages) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual $46,596 $45,404 $42,550 $1,192 3% $2,854 7%UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement (a) 39,257 34,933 33,018 4,324 12 1,915 6UnitedHealthcare Community & State (a) 16,422 14,954 13,123 1,468 10 1,831 14UnitedHealthcare International 1,144 45 39 1,099 nm 6 15Total UnitedHealthcare revenue $103,419 $95,336 $88,730 $8,083 8% $6,606 7%nm= not meaningful(a)In the fourth quarter of 2012, UnitedHealthcare reclassified 75,000 dually eligible enrollees to UnitedHealthcare Community & State from UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement to better reflect how these members are served.

In fee-based commercial products, the increase was due to a number of new business awards and strong customer retention. Medicare Advantage increased due to strengthened execution in product design, marketing and local engagement, which drove sales growth, combined with the addition of 185,000 Medicare Advantage members from 2012 acquisitions. Medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers, partially offset by a fourth quarter market withdrawal from one product in a specific region, affecting 175,000 beneficiaries. Medicare Supplement growth was due to strong retention and new sales. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, membership decreased primarily as a result of the first quarter 2012 loss of approximately 470,000 auto-assigned low-income subsidy Medicare Part D beneficiaries, due to pricing benchmarks for the government-subsidized low income Medicare Part D market coming in below our bids in a number of regions. International represents commercial membership in Brazil added as a result of the Amil acquisition in 2012.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth in 2012 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served, commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates.UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations for 2012 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development. The favorable development for 2012 was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing. In March 2012, UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans was awarded the TRICARE West Region Managed Care Support Contract. The contract, for health care operations, includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the government’s option. The first year of operations is anticipated to begin April 1, 2013. The base administrative services contract is expected to generate a total of $1.4 billion in revenues over the five years.Optum. Total revenues increased in 2012 due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at OptumHealth, partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of UnitedHealthcare Part D prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes.Optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification, integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products.39Table of ContentsThe results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increases at OptumHealth for 2012 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery, and strong overall business growth.Earnings from operations for 2012 and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations. OptumInsightRevenues at OptumInsight for 2012 increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers, which was partially offset by the June 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business.The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management.OptumRxThe decreases in OptumRx revenues in 2012 were due to the reduction in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D plan participants. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $15.6 billion for 2012 and $16.7 billion for 2011.OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the Medicare Part D business and investments to support growth initiatives, which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications. Over the course of 2013, we will consolidate and manage our commercial pharmacy benefit programs from Express Scripts’ subsidiary, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. As a result of this transition, OptumRx expects to add approximately12 million members throughout 2013.2011 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2010 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues for 2011 were driven by strong organic growth in the number of individuals served in our UnitedHealthcare businesses, commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends and revenue growth across all Optum businesses.Medical CostsMedical costs for 2011 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our commercial and public and senior markets businesses and continued increases in the cost per service paid for health system use, and a modest increase in health system utilization, mainly in outpatient and physician office settings.For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2011 and 2010 there was $720 million and $800 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in both periods was primarily driven by continued improvements in claims submission timeliness, which resulted in higher completion factors and lower than expected health system utilization levels. The favorable development in 2010 also benefited from a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. Operating CostsThe increase in our operating costs for 2011 was due to business growth, including an increased mix of Optum and UnitedHealthcare fee-based and service revenues, which have higher operating costs, and increased spending related to reform readiness and compliance. These factors were partially offset by overall operating cost management and the increase in 2010 operating costs due to the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. 40Table of ContentsIncome Tax RateThe effective income tax rate for 2011 decreased compared to the prior year due to favorable resolution of various historical tax matters in the current year as well as a higher effective income tax rate in 2010, due to the cumulative implementation of certain changes under the Health Reform Legislation.Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth for 2011 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across our businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting expected underlying medical cost trends.UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations for 2011 increased compared to the prior year as revenue growth and improvements in the operating cost ratio more than offset increased compliance costs and an increase to the medical care ratio, which was primarily due to the initiation of premium rebate obligations in 2011, and lower favorable reserve development levels. Optum. Total revenue for these businesses increased in 2011 due to business growth and acquisitions at OptumHealth and OptumInsight and growth in customers served through pharmaceutical benefit management programs at OptumRx.Optum’s operating margin for 2011 was down compared to 2010. The decrease was due to changes in business mix within Optum’s businesses and realignment of certain internal business arrangements.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthIncreased revenues at OptumHealth for 2011 were primarily due to expansions in service offerings through acquisitions in clinical services, as well as growth in consumer and population health management offerings. Earnings from operations for 2011 and operating margin decreased compared to 2010. The decreases reflect the impact from internal business and service arrangement realignments and the mix effect of growth and expansion in newer businesses such as clinical services.OptumInsightIncreased revenues at OptumInsight for 2011 were due to the impact of organic growth and the full-year impact of 2010 acquisitions, which were partially offset by the divestiture of the clinical trials services business in June 2011.The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 reflect an increased mix of higher margin services in 2011 as well as the effect on 2010 earnings from operations and operating margin of the goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. OptumRxThe increase in OptumRx revenues for 2011 was due to increased prescription volumes, primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business, and a favorable mix of higher revenue specialty drug prescriptions. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $16.7 billion and $14.4 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively.OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2011 decreased as the mix of lower margin specialty pharmaceuticals and Medicaid business and investments to support growth initiatives including the in-sourcing of our commercial pharmacy benefit programs more than offset the earnings contribution from higher revenues and greater use of generic medications.LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. 41Table of ContentsOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2012, based on the 2011 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid by our U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.6 billion.In 2012, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. In 2011, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.5 billion, including $1.1 billion of extraordinary dividends. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or drawings under our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $7,155 $6,968 $6,273 $187 $695Proceeds from issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 4,567 346 94 4,221 252Proceeds from common stock issuances 1,078 381 272 697 109Net proceeds from customer funds administered — 37 974 (37) (937)Other — 391 20 (391) 371Total sources of cash 12,800 8,123 7,633 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions (6,280) (1,459) (2,304) (4,821) 845Common stock repurchases (3,084) (2,994) (2,517) (90) (477)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,299) (1,695) (2,157) 396 462Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net of dispositions (1,070) (1,018) (878) (52) (140)Cash dividends paid (820) (651) (449) (169) (202)Net cash paid for customer funds administered (324) — — (324) —Acquisition of noncontrolling interest shares (319) — — (319) —Other (627) — (5) (627) 5Total uses of cash (13,823) (7,817) (8,310) Net (decrease) increase in cash $(1,023) $306 $(677) $(1,329) $9832012 Cash Flows Compared to 2011 Cash FlowsCash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased $187 million, or 3% from 2011 due to increased net income and related tax accruals, which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year rebate payments were made under the Health Reform Legislation.42Table of ContentsCash flows used for investing activities increased $4.5 billion, or 107%, primarily due to increased investments in acquisitions in 2012. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further information on 2012 acquisitions.Cash flows from financing activities increased $3.0 billion primarily due to increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances, partially offset by increases in cash paid for customer funds related to Part D and increased shareholder dividend payments. The increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances were primarily related to the Amil acquisition.2011 Cash Flows Compared to 2010 Cash FlowsCash flows from operating activities increased $695 million, or 11%, from 2010. The increase was primarily driven by growth in net earnings and changes in various working capital accounts, which were partially offset by a reduction in unearned revenues due to the early receipt of certain 2011 state Medicaid premium payments in 2010, which increased 2010 cash from operating activities. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $1.2 billion, or 22%, primarily due to relatively lower investments in acquisitions in 2011 and a decrease in net purchases of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $879 million, or 55%, primarily due to increased share repurchases and cash dividends in 2011, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings.Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2012, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.3 billion included $8.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.1 billion was held by non-regulated entities), $19.2 billion of debt securities and $677 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $241 million of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail of our fair value measurements.Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2012. Included in the debt securities balance was $1.9 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2012. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below. As of December 31, 2012, we had $1.6 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.3%.Bank Credit Facilities. We have $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 21 banks, which mature in November 2017 and November 2013, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for our $4.0 billion commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2012. The interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2012, the annual interest rates on these facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.3%.Our bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ 43Table of Contentsequity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 35.0% as of December 31, 2012. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2012.Long-term debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases.In connection with the Amil acquisition, we assumed variable rate debt denominated in Brazilian Reais, Amil’s functional currency. The total Brazilian Real denominated long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 was $611 million, and had an aggregate weighted average interest rate of approximately 9%. For more detail on the Amil debt see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.”In October 2012, we issued $2.5 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $625 million of 0.850% fixed-rate notes due October 2015, $625 million of 1.400% fixed-rate notes due October 2017, $625 million of 2.750% fixed-rate notes due February 2023 and $625 million of 3.950% fixed-rate notes due October 2042. In August 2012, we completed an exchange of $1.1 billion of our zero coupon senior unsecured notes due November 2022 for $0.5 billion additional issuance of our 2.875% notes due in March 2022, $0.1 billion additional issuance of our 4.375% notes due March 2042 and $0.1 billion in cash. The transaction was undertaken to increase financial flexibility and reduce interest expense. In March 2012, we issued $1.0 billion in senior unsecured notes. The issuance included $600 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due March 2022 and $400 million of 4.375% fixed-rate notes due March 2042.Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2012 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Negative A Stable A- Stable bbb+ StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/aThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.Share Repurchase Program. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2012, our Board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 85 million shares of our common stock. For details of our 2012 share repurchases, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Dividends. In June 2012, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $0.85 per share, paid quarterly. Since May 2011, we had paid an annual dividend of $0.65 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. For details of our dividend payments, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Amil Tender Offer. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we purchased approximately 65% of the outstanding shares of Amil for $3.5 billion. We expect to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest during the first half of 2013 through a tender offer for Amil’s publicly traded shares. The tender offer price will be at the same price paid to Amil’s controlling shareholders, adjusted for statutory interest under Brazilian law from the date of payment to the controlling shareholders to the date of payment to the tendering minority shareholders.44Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2012, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2013 2014 to 2015 2016 to 2017 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $3,413 $3,271 $3,384 $16,769 $26,837Operating leases 380 676 510 556 2,122Purchase obligations (b) 137 184 7 — 328Future policy benefits (c) 135 256 265 1,923 2,579Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 11 — — 60 71Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 89 18 6 1,511 1,624Other obligations (f) 50 144 60 43 297Redeemable noncontrolling interests (g) 1,393 182 546 — 2,121Total contractual obligations $5,608 $4,731 $4,778 $20,862 $35,979(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. For variable rate debt, the rates in effect at December 31, 2012 were used to calculate the interest coupon payments. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, ""Financial Statements"" for more detail. (b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012. (c)Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, ""Financial Statements"" for more detail. (d)As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.”(e)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(f)Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. (g)Includes commitments to purchase the remaining publicly traded Amil shares as well as the put/call for the shares owned by Amil's remaining non-public shareholders. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, ""Financial Statements"" for more detail. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2012, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent 45Table of Contentsperiods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2012, our days outstanding in medical payables was 49 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2012, 2011, and 2010 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $860 million, $720 million and $800 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The completion factor includes judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2012: Completion FactorsIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $261(0.50) 173(0.25) 870.25 (86)0.50 (172)0.75 (257)Medical cost PMPM trend factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a 46Table of Contentsbroad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2012: Medical Costs PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $5052 3371 168(1) (168)(2) (337)(3) (505)The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2012, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2012; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2012 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2012 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $62 million. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Effective in 2011, U.S. commercial health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. Our Medicare Advantage and Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for additional information regarding these audits.47Table of ContentsGoodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategy. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions around unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated.•Medical cost trends. See further discussion of medical costs trends within Medical Costs above. Similar factors are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. •Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost productivity initiatives.•Capital levels. The capital structure and requirements for each business is considered.Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation”. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and how other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Part I and “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty in regards to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future.We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2013. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values, thus we concluded that there was no need for any impairment of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2012. Intangible assets. Separately-identifiable intangible assets are acquired in business combinations and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). Our intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 77% of our total intangible asset balance of $4.7 billion.48Table of ContentsCustomer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rate, perpetuity growth rate and discount rate. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested).Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2012.Investments As of December 31, 2012, we had investments with a carrying value of $21 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2012, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $825 million and gross unrealized losses of $9 million. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in our income statement. The most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment.49Table of ContentsFair values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare:•the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, its custodian, its investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and•changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-than-temporary impairment assessment. Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations, etc.) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses of $9 million and $32 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $6 million, $12 million and $23 million, respectively. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2012. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available including current facts and circumstances changing, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” a 1% increase in market interest rates has the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $656 million.Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets based on the weight of available evidence (both positive and negative) for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such 50Table of Contentsexaminations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2012 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $86 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving us are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2012, we had an aggregate $1.9 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2012, the reinsurer was rated by A.M. Best as “A+.” As of December 31, 2012, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, (b) foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian Real and (c) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.As of December 31, 2012, we had $9.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $6.7 billion of our debt and deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2012 were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, $19.1 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $13.6 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.51Table of ContentsWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts. The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2012Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofInvestments (b) Fair Value ofDebt2 % $189 $134 $(1,303) $(2,200)1 94 67 (656) (1,194)(1) (18) (14) 518 1,366(2) nm nm 686 2,747 December 31, 2011Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofInvestments (b) Fair Value ofDebt2% $199 $28 $(1,239) $(1,946)1 99 14 (622) (1,082)(1) (12) (4) 586 1,086(2) nm nm 885 2,343nm = not meaningful(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful.(b)As of December 31, 2012, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.With the Amil acquisition, we have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian Real to the U.S. Dollar in translation of Amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian Real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian Real. For example, as of December 31, 2012 a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real would cause a reduction in net assets of $510 million. We manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies. We funded certain cash needs of Amil through intercompany notes. At December 31, 2012, we had currency swaps with a total notional amount of $256 million hedging the U.S. dollar to the Brazilian Real to provide a cash flow hedge on the principal amount of the intercompany notes to Amil.As of December 31, 2012, we had $677 million of investments in equity securities, including employee savings plan related investments of $348 million and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will impact the value of our equity investments.52Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:45.953687

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare International;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements.”2014 Business Realignment. On January 1, 2014, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. Our Optum business platform took responsibility for certain technology operations and business processing activities with the intention of pursuing additional third-party commercial opportunities in addition to continuing to serve UnitedHealthcare. These activities, which were historically a corporate function, will be included in OptumInsight’s results of operations. Our periodic filings with the SEC beginning with our first quarter 2014 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment and will continue to present the same four reportable segments (UnitedHealthcare, OptumHealth, OptumInsight and OptumRx).Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the United States, health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including enacted health care reforms in the United States, which could also impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. We seek to price our health care benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends, while balancing growth, margins, and competitive dynamics (such as product positioning and price competitiveness) and legislative and regulatory changes such as cost increases for the industry fees and tax provisions of Health Reform Legislation. We continue to expect premium rates to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates. Aggregating UnitedHealthcare’s businesses, and before giving effect to Health Reform Legislation taxes, we believe the medical care ratio will rise over time as we continue to grow in the senior and public markets and participate in the emerging public health benefit exchange market.In response to Health Reform Legislation, HHS established a review threshold of annual commercial premium rate increases generally at or above 10% and enacted a new rule requiring the production of information for any proposed rate increase. HHS review does not supersede existing state review and approval procedures. We have experienced regulatory challenges to appropriate premium rate increases in several states, including California and New York. The competitive forces common in our markets do not support unjustifiable rate increases. Further, our rates and rate filings are developed using methods 30consistent with the standards of actuarial practices and we endeavor to sustain a commercial medical care ratio in a stable range for an equivalent mix of business. We have requested and received rate increases above 10% in a number of markets due to the combination of medical cost trends and the incremental costs of health care reform. We expect commercial pricing to continue to be highly competitive. The intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. Overall, the industry has experienced lower medical costs trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. Conversely, carriers are generally reflecting the 2014 Health Reform Legislation industry fees in their pricing. In some markets, competitors have adjusted their pricing to reflect recent medical cost trend experience as well as the implication of rate review rules and new benefit changes from Health Reform Legislation. In other areas we are seeing greater price competition due to pricing adjustments and other varied approaches used by competitors. The Medicare Advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years, with additional reductions to take effect in 2014 and 2015, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect these factors to result in year-over-year pressure on gross margin percentages for our Medicare business during 2014.States are struggling to balance budget pressures with increases in their Medicaid expenditures. During 2013, rate changes for some Medicaid programs were slightly negative year-over-year. In general, we expect continued pressure on net margin percentages due to the Medicaid reimbursement rate environment, which we expect will remain tight due to the potential non-collectability of the insurer fee primarily related to Medicare Dual SNP programs and Medicaid. We continue to work with our state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends, including fees and related taxes, and to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new bids and maintenance of existing Medicaid contracts. Medical Cost Trends. We expect our 2014 commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.0% plus or minus 50 basis points, compared to approximately 5% in 2013. In 2014, we expect relatively consistent unit cost and utilization trends compared to 2013, before taking into account reform impacts. The impact of Health Reform Legislation and mandates is expected to pressure 2014 medical cost trends. Driving the increases are mandated essential health benefits and limits on out-of-pocket maximums. Consistent with recent years, our 2014 trend is expected to be driven primarily by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers. We expect 2014 pharmacy trends to be consistent with 2013. The primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty drugs. In recent years, the recent weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends. We believe the expected stability in the utilization trends in 2014 is influenced by our medical management strategies, our continued focus on value-based contracting arrangements and greater consumer engagement. Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market is changing based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care for people, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. The focus on delivery system modernization and payment reform is critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. Through expansion of our existing programs and the creation of new programs, we are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2013, more than 2 million people we serve were directly aligned through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full risk, shared risk and bundled episode of care payment approaches.This trend is also creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investment in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, providing growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Government Reliance on Private Sector. The government, as a benefit sponsor, has been increasingly relying on private sector programs. We expect this trend to continue as we believe the private sector provides a more flexible, better managed, higher quality health care experience than do traditional passive indemnity programs typically used in governmental benefit programs.Many states are expanding their interest in managed care with particular emphasis on consumers who have complex and expensive health care needs. Medicaid managed care is increasingly viewed as an effective method to improve quality and manage costs. For example, there are nearly 10 million dually eligible beneficiaries who typically have complex conditions, with costs of care that are far higher than those of a typical Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary. Similarly, a small but complex group of nearly 4 million individuals who qualify for additional benefits under LTC programs represent only 6% of the total Medicaid population yet account for more than 30% of total Medicaid expenditures. The long-term care market represents a portion of the more than 15 million ABD Americans. While these individuals’ health needs are more complex and more costly, 31they have primarily been historically served in unmanaged environments. These markets provide UnitedHealthcare and Optum with an opportunity to work with governments to improve the health status of these populations through coordination of care. As of December 31, 2013, UnitedHealthcare served more than 275,000 people in legacy dually eligible programs through Medicare Advantage and SNPs. In the first half of 2014, UnitedHealthcare Community & State will help implement Integrated MME program awards in three states.Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items; for additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage payment benchmarks have been cut over the last several years, including 2013, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. Additionally, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, triggered automatic across-the-board budget cuts (known as sequestration), including a 2% reduction in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D payments beginning April 1, 2013. The CMS final notice of 2014 Medicare Advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes significant reductions to 2014 Medicare Advantage payments, including the benchmark reductions described previously. These reductions and Health Reform Legislation insurance industry tax described below result in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 4% in 2014, against a typical industry forward medical cost trend outlook of 3%. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. Compared to 2013, and prior to any efforts to mitigate these funding reductions, we estimate that the net impact on our 2014 consolidated after-tax earnings will be approximately $0.9 billion. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans in 2014. Further, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be required to have minimum MLRs of 85%. We do not believe the minimum MLR standard will have a material impact on our earnings. CMS is expected to release the proposed 2015 Medicare Advantage Rates on February 21, 2014. We expect sustained Medicare Advantage rate pressures in 2015 due to the continuing effect of the factors described above.Health Reform Legislation directed HHS to establish a program to reward high-quality Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2012. Accordingly, our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on a plan’s star rating. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan’s revenue. The current expanded stars bonus program that pays bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher is set to expire after 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will only be paid to 4 and 5 star plans. For the 2014 payment year, approximately 57% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and approximately 9% are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher. For the 2015 payment year, based on scoring released by CMS in October 2013, approximately 70% of our current Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans that will be rated 3.5 stars or higher and approximately 24% are enrolled in plans that will be rated 4 stars or higher. The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we can make and are making to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase member premiums over and above the monthly payments we receive from the government, and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. The depth of the underfunding of these benefits has caused us to exit certain plans and market areas for 2014 in which we served approximately 150,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in 2013. In other markets, we may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest benefit cuts, but expect stable or growing membership in our strongest markets. We are dedicating substantial resources to improving our quality scores and star ratings to improve the performance and sustainability of our local market programs for 2016 and beyond.In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries increasing the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Industry Fees and Taxes. Health Reform Legislation includes an annual, non-deductible insurance industry tax to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based products, beginning January 1, 2014. The industry-wide amount of 32the annual tax is $8 billion in 2014, $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. The annual tax will be allocated to each market participant based on the ratio of the entity’s net premiums written during the preceding calendar year to the total health insurance industry’s net premiums written for any U.S. health risk-based products during the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. This tax will first be expensed ratably throughout 2014 and our first payment will be made in September 2014. With the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014, Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompass: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements, $25 billion over a three-year period beginning in 2014 of which $20 billion, subject to increases based on state decisions, will fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion will fund the U.S. Treasury (Reinsurance Program). While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only non-grandfathered, market reform compliant individual business will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. We expect our share of the industry fee to be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2014. We estimate a significant increase of approximately 500 basis points in our 2014 effective income tax rate because this fee is not deductible. We estimate that the 2014 effect on earnings from operations due to our tax deductible contributions to the Reinsurance Program will be approximately $0.5 billion in 2014, payable in 2015. We do not expect material payments or receipts related to the temporary risk corridors program, permanent risk adjustment program or reinsurance recoveries in 2014. Our 2014 results of operations will include estimates related to these fees and programs. To the extent possible, we include the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing, which is expected to result in $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of additional premium in 2014. Since the industry fee will be included in operating costs, we expect our medical care ratio to decrease in 2014 compared to historical results; the industry fee cost will be factored in, however, when calculating minimum MLR rebates.Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. Across markets, we and our competitors are adapting product, network and marketing strategies to anticipate new distribution or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges, private exchanges and off exchange purchasing. Effective in 2014, states may create their own public exchange, enter a partnership exchange or rely on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers, with enrollment processes that commenced in October 2013. Exchanges create new market dynamics that could impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market, the pace of migration in the market and the impact of the migration on our established membership. For example, over time certain employers may no longer offer health benefits to their employees and some employers purchasing full risk products could convert to self-funded programs. Our level of participation in public exchanges has been and will continue to be determined on a state-by-state basis. Each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities, our current local presence, our competitive positioning, our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and members and the regulatory environment. In 2014, we are participating in 13 exchanges in 10 states and the District of Columbia, including four individual and nine SHOP exchanges.Health Reform Legislation and related U.S. Supreme Court ruling also provide for optional expanded Medicaid coverage effective in January 2014. These measures remain subject to implementation at the state level, with varying levels of state adoption planned for January 1, 2014. We participate in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and of these, more than half have opted to expand Medicaid. Individual & Small Group Market Reforms. Health Reform Legislation includes several provisions, for most individual and small group plans with plan years beginning on January 1, 2014, that are expected to alter the individual and small group marketplace, including, among other matters: (1) adjusted community rating requirements, which will change how individual and small group plans are priced in many states; (2) essential health benefit requirements, which will result in benefit changes for many individual and small group policyholders; (3) actuarial value requirements, which will significantly impact benefit designs in the individual market, such as member cost sharing requirements; and (4) guaranteed issue requirements, which will require carriers to provide coverage to any qualified group or individual. These changes have resulted in significant benefit design and pricing changes for a substantial portion of the fully insured individual and small group markets. In 2014, we expect a decrease in individual membership due to a reduction in the number of states in which we will offer policies to new customers.33RESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information: For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions, except percentages and per share data) 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011Revenues: Premiums $109,557 $99,728 $91,983 $9,829 10% $7,745 8%Services 8,997 7,437 6,613 1,560 21 824 12Products 3,190 2,773 2,612 417 15 161 6Investment and other income 745 680 654 65 10 26 4Total revenues 122,489 110,618 101,862 11,871 11 8,756 9Operating costs: Medical costs 89,290 80,226 74,332 9,064 11 5,894 8Operating costs 19,362 17,306 15,557 2,056 12 1,749 11Cost of products sold 2,839 2,523 2,385 316 13 138 6Depreciation and amortization 1,375 1,309 1,124 66 5 185 16Total operating costs 112,866 101,364 93,398 11,502 11 7,966 9Earnings from operations 9,623 9,254 8,464 369 4 790 9Interest expense (708) (632) (505) 76 12 127 25Earnings before income taxes 8,915 8,622 7,959 293 3 663 8Provision for income taxes (3,242) (3,096) (2,817) 146 5 279 10Net earnings 5,673 5,526 5,142 147 3 384 7Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (48) — — 48 — — nmNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $5,625 $5,526 $5,142 $99 2% $384 7%Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $5.50 $5.28 $4.73 $0.22 4% $0.55 12%Medical care ratio (a) 81.5% 80.4% 80.8% 1.1 % (0.4)% Operating cost ratio 15.8 15.6 15.3 0.2 0.3 Operating margin 7.9 8.4 8.3 (0.5) 0.1 Tax rate 36.4 35.9 35.4 0.5 0.5 Net margin 4.6 5.0 5.0 (0.4) — Return on equity (b) 17.7% 18.7% 18.9% (1.0)% (0.2)% nm= not meaningful(a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings divided by average equity.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2013 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2012 and other 2013 significant items.•Consolidated revenues increased by 11%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased by 10% and Optum revenues grew by 26%. •Earnings from operations increased by 4%, including a decrease of 6% at UnitedHealthcare and an increase of 61% at Optum.•UnitedHealthcare medical enrollment grew organically by 4.5 million people, including 2.9 million military beneficiaries through the TRICARE contract. Medicare Part D stand-alone membership grew by 725,000 people. •OptumRx completed the insourcing of pharmacy services for 12 million new and migrating customers served by UnitedHealthcare.•The consolidated medical care ratio of 81.5% increased 110 basis points.•As of December 31, 2013, there was $1.0 billion of cash available for general corporate use and 2013 cash flows from operations were $7.0 billion. 342013 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2012 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues during 2013 were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions, including Amil, growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of Optum’s major businesses. The revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in Medicare Advantage rates. Also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fully-insured commercial customer from a risk-based to a fee-based arrangement affecting 1.1 million members. While this conversion reduced our full-year 2013 consolidated revenues by $2.3 billion, the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible.Medical Costs and Medical Care RatioMedical costs during 2013 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above. The year-over-year medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for Medicare Advantage products, changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs, and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $680 million, compared to $860 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.Operating CostsThe increase in our operating costs during 2013 was due to business growth, including an increase in fee-based benefits and fee-based service revenues and a greater mix of international business, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts.

The number of individuals in commercial fee-based arrangements increased due to this conversion as well as new business awards and strong customer retention. On April 1, 2013, UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans began service under the TRICARE West Region Managed Care Support Contract. This administrative services contract for health care operations added 2.9 million people and includes a transition period and five one-year renewals at the government’s option. Medicare Advantage participation increased due to solid execution in product design, marketing and local engagement, which drove sales growth. Medicaid growth was due to a combination of winning new state accounts and growth within existing state customers, partially offset by the first quarter 2013 divestiture of our Medicaid business in South Carolina and a fourth quarter 2012 market withdrawal from one product in Wisconsin, which combined affected 235,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention in the market. International represents commercial customers in Brazil added in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the Amil acquisition, and subsequent organic growth. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth in 2013 was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served. The effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above.UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development.36OptumTotal revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to broad-based growth across Optum’s services portfolio with growth in each of Optum’s major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare commercial customers and external clients.Optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012, reflecting progress on Optum’s plan to accelerate growth and improve productivity by strengthening integration and business alignment.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increases at OptumHealth in 2013 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2012 acquisitions in local care delivery, and organic growth.Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to revenue growth and an improved cost structure across the business, including local care delivery, population health and wellness solutions, and health-related financial services offerings.OptumInsightRevenues at OptumInsight in 2013 increased primarily due to the impact of a 2012 acquisition and growth in services to commercial payers.The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 reflected increased revenues, changes in product mix and continuing improvements in business alignment and efficiency.OptumRxThe increase in OptumRx revenues in 2013 were due to the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Part D members and external clients. Over the course of 2013, we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the OptumRx platform from a third party.Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, pricing disciplines, and greater use of generic medications. 2012 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2011 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesRevenue increases in 2012 were driven by growth in the number of individuals served and premium rate increases related to underlying medical cost trends in our UnitedHealthcare businesses and growth in our Optum health service and technology offerings.Medical CostsMedical costs increased in 2012 due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses, unit cost inflation across all businesses and continued moderate increases in health system use, partially offset by an increase in favorable medical reserve development. Unit cost increases represented the primary driver of our medical cost trend, with the largest contributor being price increases to hospitals. Operating CostsThe increases in operating costs for 2012 were due to business growth, including increases in revenues from UnitedHealthcare fee-based benefits and Optum services, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, as well as investments in the OptumRx pharmacy management services and UnitedHealthcare Military & Veterans businesses. Income Tax RateThe increase in our effective income tax rate for 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various tax matters in 2011, which lowered the 2011 effective income tax rate.37Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth in 2012 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served, commercial premium rate increases related to expected increases in underlying medical cost trends and the impact of lower premium rebates.UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations for 2012 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors that increased revenues combined with an improvement in the medical care ratio that was driven by effective management of medical costs and increased favorable medical reserve development. The favorable development for 2012 was driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels and increased efficiency in claims handling and processing. Optum. Total revenues increased in 2012 due to business growth and 2011 acquisitions at OptumHealth, partially offset by a reduction in pharmacy service revenues related to reduced levels of UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D prescription drug membership and related prescription volumes.Optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin for 2012 increased compared to 2011 due to improvements in operating cost structure stemming from advances in business simplification, integration and overall efficiency and revenue growth in higher margin products.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increases at OptumHealth for 2012 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2011 acquisitions in integrated care delivery, and strong overall business growth.Earnings from operations for 2012 and operating margins increased compared to 2011 primarily due to gains in operating efficiency and cost management as well as increases in earnings from integrated care operations. OptumInsightRevenues at OptumInsight for 2012 increased primarily due to the impact of growth in compliance services for care providers and payment integrity offerings for commercial payers, which was partially offset by the June 2011 divestiture of the clinical trials services business.The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 reflect an improved mix of services and advances in operating efficiency and cost management.OptumRxThe decreases in OptumRx revenues in 2012 were due to the reduction in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Part D plan participants. OptumRx earnings from operations and operating margins for 2012 decreased primarily due to decreased prescription volume in the Medicare Part D business and investments to support growth initiatives, which were partially offset by earnings contributions from specialty pharmacy growth and greater use of generic medications. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary 38dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2013, based on the 2012 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid by our U.S. regulated subsidiaries to their parent companies was $4.3 billion. In 2013, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion, including $430 million of extraordinary dividends. This level of dividends maintained our target consolidated risk-based capital level. In 2012, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.9 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease)(in millions) 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $6,991 $7,155 $6,968 $(164) $187Proceeds from common stock issuances 598 1,078 381 (480) 697Proceeds from issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 152 4,567 346 (4,415) 4,221Other 31 — 428 31 (428)Total sources of cash 7,772 12,800 8,123 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (3,170) (3,084) (2,994) (86) (90)Cash paid for acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares, net of cash assumed and dispositions (1,791) (6,599) (1,459) 4,808 (5,140)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,611) (1,299) (1,695) (312) 396Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net (1,161) (1,070) (1,018) (91) (52)Cash dividends paid (1,056) (820) (651) (236) (169)Customer funds administered — (324) — 324 (324)Other (27) (627) — 600 (627)Total uses of cash (8,816) (13,823) (7,817) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (86) — — nm nmNet (decrease) increase in cash $(1,130) $(1,023) $306 $(107) $(1,329)nm= not meaningful2013 Cash Flows Compared to 2012 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased due to the net effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including: (a) an increase in pharmacy rebates receivables stemming from the increased membership at OptumRx, the effects of which were partially offset by (b) increases in medical costs payable due to the growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets and international businesses. Other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) decreased investments in acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares (the activity in 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining publicly traded shares of Amil during the second quarter of 2013 for $1.5 billion); (b) a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and long-term debt, as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt (in 2012, the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt primarily related to the Amil acquisition); and (c) increased net purchases of investments. 392012 Cash Flows Compared to 2011 Cash FlowsCash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased due to increased net income and related tax accruals, which were partially offset by the payment in 2012 of 2011 premium rebate obligations as 2012 was the first year in which rebate payments were made under Health Reform Legislation.Other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) increased investments in acquisitions in 2012; (b) increases in long-term debt, commercial paper and common stock issuances, primarily related to the Amil acquisition; (c) increases in cash paid for customer funds related to Medicare Part D and increased shareholder dividend payments. Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2013, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $28.3 billion included $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.0 billion was available for general corporate use), $19.4 billion of debt securities and $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $311 million of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 2.5 years. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.6 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2013. Included in the debt securities balance was $1.4 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. Due to the high underlying credit ratings of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities with and without the guarantee was “AA” as of December 31, 2013. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper. We maintain a $4.0 billion commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the bank credit facilities described below. As of December 31, 2013, we had $1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average annual interest rate of 0.2%.Bank Credit Facilities. We have $3.0 billion five-year and $1.0 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facilities with 23 banks, which mature in November 2018 and November 2014, respectively. These facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper program and are available for general corporate purposes. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2013. The interest rates on borrowings are variable depending on term and are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. As of December 31, 2013, the annual interest rates on both bank credit facilities, had they been drawn, would have ranged from 1.0% to 1.2%.Our bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 34.4% as of December 31, 2013. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2013.Long-term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases.In February 2013, we issued $2.25 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $250 million of floating-rate notes due August 2014, $500 million of 1.625% fixed-rate notes due March 2019, $750 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due March 2023 and $750 million of 4.250% fixed-rate notes due March 2043.40In March and April of 2013, we redeemed all of our outstanding subsidiary variable rate debt for $619 million.Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2013 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A Positive A- Stable bbb+ StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/aThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital.Share Repurchase Program. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize our capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain Board restrictions. In June 2013, our Board renewed and expanded our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 110 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 83 million shares of our common stock. Dividends. In June 2013, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share, paid quarterly. Since June 2012, we had paid an annual cash dividend of $0.85 per share, paid quarterly. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.Amil Tender Offer. We acquired all of Amil’s remaining public shares for $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2013, bringing our ownership in Amil to 90%.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2013, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2014 2015 to 2016 2017 to 2018 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $2,644 $3,450 $3,411 $18,147 $27,652Operating leases 487 800 572 544 2,403Purchase obligations (b) 250 174 14 — 438Future policy benefits (c) 136 258 267 1,940 2,601Unrecognized tax benefits (d) — — — 78 78Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 186 43 — 1,482 1,711Other obligations (f) 94 113 49 12 268Redeemable noncontrolling interests (g) 54 158 963 — 1,175Total contractual obligations $3,851 $4,996 $5,276 $22,203 $36,326(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values.

See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more detail. (b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013. 41(c)Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more detail. (d)As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, they have been classified as due “Thereafter.”(e)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(f)Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. (g)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries, primarily the shares owned by Amil’s remaining non-public shareholders.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2013, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2013, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2013, 2012, and 2011 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $680 million, $860 million and $720 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated 42by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2013: Completion FactorsIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $291(0.50) 194(0.25) 970.25 (96)0.50 (192)0.75 (287)Medical cost PMPM trend factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2013: Medical Costs PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $5732 3821 191(1) (191)(2) (382)(3) (573)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2013, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2013; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2013 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare 43Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2013 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $65 million. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for additional information regarding these audits. Additionally, beginning in 2014, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans will be subject to a minimum MLR threshold of 85%. We will include in our estimates of premiums to be recognized the expected premium minimum MLR rebates, if any. U.S. commercial health plans with MLRs on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% forindividuals) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. 44Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. •Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation.” For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Part I and “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and peer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future.We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2014. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.Intangible assets. Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). These intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 73% of our total intangible asset balance of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2013.Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rates, perpetuity growth rates and discount rates. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested).Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2013.45Investments As of December 31, 2013, we had investments with a carrying value of $21.5 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2013, our available-for-sale investments had gross unrealized gains of $326 million and gross unrealized losses of $234 million. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, and recognized in net earnings, and all other causes, and recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. The most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment.Fair values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare:•prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, our custodian, our investment consultant and/or third-party investment advisors; and•changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-than-temporary impairment assessment. Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.The unrealized losses of $234 million and $9 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $8 million, $6 million and $12 million, respectively. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2013. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. 46The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” a 1% increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $756 million.Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. An uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2013 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $89 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements” for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and 47other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A+.” As of December 31, 2013, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, (b) foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and (c) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.As of December 31, 2013, we had $8.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $9.6 billion of our commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2013 were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2013, $18.5 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $10.2 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or periodically through the use of interest rate swap contracts. The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2013 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2013Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofInvestments (b) Fair Value ofDebt2 % $175 $189 $(1,474) $(1,786)1 87 95 (756) (974)(1) (52) (17) 704 1,167(2) nm nm 1,224 2,505 December 31, 2012Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofInvestments (b) Fair Value ofDebt2 % $189 $134 $(1,303) $(2,200)1 94 67 (656) (1,194)(1) (18) (14) 518 1,366(2) nm nm 686 2,747nm = not meaningful(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful.(b)As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the 48Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $490 million. We manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2013, we had $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds, employee savings plan related investments, private equity funds, and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-US dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in private equity are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks, and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions. 49",2023-12-30 16:29:43.922149

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the U.S., Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the U.S., health care spending comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product and has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, including enacted health reform legislation in the United States, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the new risk adjustment, risk corridor and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets. We will continue to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. Overall, we continue to be under pressure from ongoing market competition in commercial products and from government payment rates. The intensity of commercial pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. Health plans have generally reflected the Industry Tax and Reinsurance Programs (together, ACA Fees) in their pricing. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. Having reflected the additional cost step-ups in 2014 related to the ACA Fees, we anticipate health plans’ pricing returning to a more normal inflation rate in 2015. Annual commercial premium rate increases are subject to federal and state review and approval procedures. While our rates and rate filings are developed using methods consistent with the standards of actuarial practice, we have experienced regulatory challenges to proposed premium rate increases in certain states, including California and New York. The Medicare Advantage rate structure is changing and funding has been cut in recent years, with additional reductions to take effect in 2015, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We are taking actions to respond to these funding reductions, but the reductions adversely affected after-tax earnings for our Medicare business during 2014, and we expect our 29Table of Contents2015 Medicare MLR to be slightly higher than in 2014.We expect continued Medicaid revenue increases due to anticipated growth in our offerings; we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends are primarily related to unit costs, utilization and prescription drug costs. Consistent with our experience in recent years, our 2014 cost trends were largely driven by continued unit cost pressure from health care providers. Although the weak economic environment combined with our medical cost management strategies has had a favorable impact on utilization trends in recent years, the impacts of Health Reform Legislation, namely mandated essential health benefits and limits on out-of-pocket maximums, are exerting upward pressure on medical cost trends. The primary drivers of prescription drug trends continue to be unit cost pressure on brand name drugs and a shift towards expensive new specialty medications, including new hepatitis C therapies.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. Delivery system modernization and payment reform are critical and the alignment of incentives between key constituents remains an important theme. We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2014, we served nearly 3 million people through the most progressive of these arrangements, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care payment approaches. As of December 31, 2014, our contracts with value based spending total nearly $37 billion annually, up significantly from recent years.This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items. For additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage rates have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017 as a result of (a) changes to CMS Medicare Advantage benchmark rates; (b) Health Reform Legislation; and (c) the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which reduced Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D payments (Sequestration). The CMS final notice of 2015 Medicare Advantage benchmark rates and payment policies includes additional significant reductions for 2015. These industry level reductions, including the impact of the Industry Tax described below, resulted in revenue reductions and incremental assessments totaling more than 6% of revenue in 2014 and more than an additional 3% in 2015, against a typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3%. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and expectation of earnings for our Medicare Advantage plans for 2015.Health Reform Legislation directed HHS to establish a program to reward high-quality Medicare Advantage plans beginning in 2012. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan has to generate to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue. The historical expanded star bonus program, which paid bonuses to qualifying plans rated 3 stars or higher expired after 2014. In 2015, quality bonus payments will be paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher. For the 2015 star bonus payment year, more than 37% of our Medicare Advantage members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars or higher. We currently expect a similar percentage of members to be enrolled in such plans for the 2016 payment year. We are dedicating substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance for the 2017 and 2018 payment years.30Table of ContentsThe ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase member premiums over the monthly payments we receive from the government, and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans. For 2015, we have added premiums in certain markets; one-third of our members that had previously purchased $0 premium products will be impacted. We may experience some reduction in membership in the plans with the greatest premiums additions, but we expect overall growth in Medicare Advantage membership in 2015.In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs. Health Reform Legislation includes an Industry Tax levied proportionally across the health insurance industry for risk-based products, which began January 1, 2014. The industry-wide amount of the annual tax was $8 billion in 2014 and increases to $11.3 billion in 2015 and 2016, $13.9 billion in 2017 and $14.3 billion in 2018. For 2019 and beyond, the amount will equal the annual tax for the preceding year increased by the rate of premium growth for the preceding year. In 2015, we expect that our share of the Industry Tax will be $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2014.With the introduction of state health insurance exchanges and other significant market reforms in the individual and small group markets in 2014, Health Reform Legislation includes three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompass: a Reinsurance Program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The Reinsurance Program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business including insured and self-funded arrangements. The total three year amount of $25 billion for the Reinsurance Program will be allocated as follows: $20 billion (2014 - $10 billion, 2015 - $6 billion, 2016 - $4 billion) subject to increases based on state decisions, to fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion (2014 and 2015 - $2 billion, 2016 - $1 billion) to fund the U.S. Treasury. While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. For detail on the Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Exchanges and Coverage Expansion. Across markets, we and our competitors are adapting product, network and marketing strategies to anticipate new or expanding distribution channels including public exchanges, private exchanges and off exchange purchasing. Effective in 2014, states have either created their own public exchange, entered a partnership exchange or relied on the federally facilitated exchange for individuals and small employers. The exchanges have created new market dynamics that have impacted and could further impact our existing businesses, depending on the ultimate member migration patterns for each market. In 2014, commercial fully insured membership expanded industry-wide with more than 7 million consumers served through the individual public exchanges alone. Self-insured enrollment remained relatively stable, but there has been an increased interest in post-reform alternatives such as private exchange solutions. Our level of participation in public exchanges is determined on a state-by-state basis. Each state is evaluated based on factors such as growth opportunities, our current local presence, our competitive positioning, our ability to honor our commitments to our local customers and consumers, and the regulatory environment. In 2014, we participated in 13 state public exchanges, including four individual and nine small group exchanges. In 2015, we are participating in 23 individual exchanges and in 12 small group exchanges.Health Reform Legislation also provided for optional expanded Medicaid coverage that became effective in January 2014. We participate in programs in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and of these, 12 states opted to expand Medicaid for 2014. For 2015, 13 of our state customers have elected to expand Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that due to Medicaid expansion, a total of 13 million people will have obtained coverage through Medicaid by the end of 2016, and we are actively seeking to build market share serving the needs of these Medicaid expansion beneficiaries and their state sponsors.31Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012Revenues: Premiums $115,302 $109,557 $99,728 $5,745 5% $9,829 10%Services 10,151 8,997 7,437 1,154 13 1,560 21Products 4,242 3,190 2,773 1,052 33 417 15Investment and other income 779 745 680 34 5 65 10Total revenues 130,474 122,489 110,618 7,985 7 11,871 11Operating costs: Medical costs 93,257 89,290 80,226 3,967 4 9,064 11Operating costs 21,681 19,362 17,306 2,319 12 2,056 12Cost of products sold 3,784 2,839 2,523 945 33 316 13Depreciation and amortization 1,478 1,375 1,309 103 7 66 5Total operating costs 120,200 112,866 101,364 7,334 6 11,502 11Earnings from operations 10,274 9,623 9,254 651 7 369 4Interest expense (618) (708) (632) (90) (13) 76 12Earnings before income taxes 9,656 8,915 8,622 741 8 293 3Provision for income taxes (4,037) (3,242) (3,096) 795 25 146 5Net earnings 5,619 5,673 5,526 (54) (1) 147 3Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests — (48) — (48) nm 48 nmNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $5,619 $5,625 $5,526 $(6) — % $99 2%Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $5.70 $5.50 $5.28 $0.20 4 % $0.22 4%Medical care ratio (a) 80.9% 81.5% 80.4% (0.6)% 1.1 % Operating cost ratio 16.6 15.8 15.6 0.8 0.2 Operating margin 7.9 7.9 8.4 — (0.5) Tax rate 41.8 36.4 35.9 5.4 0.5 Net earnings margin 4.3 4.6 5.0 (0.3) (0.4) Return on equity (b) 17.3% 17.7% 18.7% (0.4)% (1.0)% nm= not meaningful(a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Return on equity is calculated as annualized net earnings divided by average equity.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2014 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2013 and other 2014 significant items.•Consolidated revenues increased by 7%, Optum revenues grew 25% and UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 5%. •ACA Fees favorably affected our 2014 medical care ratio (110 bps), and unfavorably impacted our operating cost ratio (120 bps) and effective income tax rate (510 bps).•Earnings from operations increased by 7%, including an increase of 32% at Optum partially offset by a decrease of 2% at UnitedHealthcare.•Diluted earnings per share to UnitedHealth Group shareholders increased 4% to $5.70 and included the negative year-over-year impact of approximately $1.00 per share in ACA Fees, ACA Medicare rate cuts and other ACA impacts.•As of December 31, 2014, there was $738 million of cash available for general corporate use and 2014 cash flows from operations were $8.1 billion.32Table of Contents2014 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2013 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of Optum’s businesses. Medical Costs and Medical Care RatioMedical costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses. To the extent possible, we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing; since the ACA Fees are included in operating costs, this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014. This decrease from ACA fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Operating Cost RatioThe increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the introduction of ACA Fees and services business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains.Income Tax RateThe increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible Industry Tax.

The decrease in number of people served under commercial fee-based arrangements was primarily attributable to the loss of a large state employer account. Medicare Advantage participation increased slightly year-over-year despite the significant funding reductions, which caused us to exit certain markets in January 2014, reduce product offerings, adjust networks and reduce benefits for 2014. Approximately 60% of the Medicaid growth was driven by Medicaid expansion under the ACA with the remaining growth resulting from the combination of states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in those traditional programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. The number of people served internationally decreased year-over-year primarily due to price increases in Brazil in response to the increasing costs of mandated health care benefits. In our Medicare Part D stand-alone business, the number of people served increased primarily as a result of new product introductions and strong customer retention.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses; revenues to recover ACA Fees, which resulted in $1.5 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014; and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. These increases were partially offset by decreased commercial risk-based enrollment and a reduced level of Medicare Advantage funding.UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were pressured year-over-year by ACA Fees, Medicare Advantage funding reductions, increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis C and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses, reduced levels of per-member inpatient hospital utilization and revenue true-ups. OptumTotal revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at OptumRx and growth at OptumHealth.The increases in Optum’s earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity, partially offset by investments at OptumHealth and OptumInsight.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increased at OptumHealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in local care delivery and subacute care services.Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies, offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities.35Table of ContentsOptumInsightRevenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services, partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth.OptumRxIncreased OptumRx revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in people served in UnitedHealthcare’s public and senior markets, the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs, which was completed on January 1, 2014, growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues. Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs, and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment. 2013 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2012 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues during 2013 were primarily driven by the full year effect of 2012 acquisitions, including Amil, growth in the number of individuals served through benefit products and overall organic growth in each of Optum’s major businesses. The revenue impact of these factors was partially offset by the reduction in Medicare Advantage rates. Also offsetting the revenue increase was the first quarter conversion of a large fully-insured commercial customer from a risk-based to a fee-based arrangement affecting 1.1 million members. While this conversion reduced our full-year 2013 consolidated revenues by $2.3 billion, the impact to earnings from operations and cash flows was negligible.Medical Costs and Medical Care RatioMedical costs during 2013 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our international and public and senior markets businesses, partially offset by the funding conversion of the large client discussed above. The year-over-year medical care ratio increased primarily due to funding reductions for Medicare Advantage products, changes in business mix favoring governmental benefit programs, and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development.Operating CostsThe increase in our operating costs during 2013 was due to business growth, including an increase in fee-based benefits and fee-based service revenues and a greater mix of international business, which carry comparatively higher operating costs, partially offset by our ongoing cost containment efforts. Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth in 2013 was primarily attributable to the impact of 2012 acquisitions and the growth in the number of individuals served. The effect of these factors was partially offset by the government funding reductions described previously and the customer funding conversion discussed above.UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 decreased compared to the prior year as operating margins were pressured by the funding reductions that decreased revenues and by decreased levels of favorable reserve development.OptumTotal revenues increased in 2013 primarily due to broad-based growth across Optum’s services portfolio with growth in each of Optum’s major businesses led by pharmacy growth from the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare commercial customers and external clients.Optum’s earnings from operations and operating margin in 2013 increased significantly compared to 2012, reflecting progress on Optum’s plan to accelerate growth and improve productivity by strengthening integration and business alignment.36Table of ContentsThe results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increases at OptumHealth in 2013 were primarily due to market expansion, including growth related to 2012 acquisitions in local care delivery, and organic growth.Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to revenue growth and an improved cost structure across the business, including local care delivery, population health and wellness solutions, and health-related financial services offerings.OptumInsightRevenues at OptumInsight in 2013 increased primarily due to the impact of a 2012 acquisition and growth in services to commercial payers.The increases in earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 reflected increased revenues, changes in product mix and continuing improvements in business alignment and efficiency.OptumRxThe increase in OptumRx revenues in 2013 were due to the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs and growth in both UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Part D members and external clients. Over the course of 2013, we completed our transition of 12 million migrating and new members to the OptumRx platform from a third-party.Earnings from operations and operating margins in 2013 increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, pricing disciplines, and greater use of generic medications. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies.In 2014, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.37Table of ContentsSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $8,051 $6,991 $7,155 $1,060 $(164)Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases 799 — — 799 —Customer funds administered — 31 — (31) 31Proceeds from common stock issuances 462 598 1,078 (136) (480)Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 391 152 4,567 239 (4,415)Other 37 45 — (8) 45Total sources of cash 9,740 7,817 12,800 Uses of cash: Common stock repurchases (4,008) (3,170) (3,084) (838) (86)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software, net (1,447) (1,161) (1,070) (286) (91)Cash dividends paid (1,362) (1,056) (820) (306) (236)Cash paid for acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares, net of cash assumed (1,923) (1,836) (6,599) (87) 4,763Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities — (1,611) (1,299) 1,611 (312)Customer funds administered (638) — (324) (638) 324Other (138) (27) (627) (111) 600Total uses of cash (9,516) (8,861) (13,823) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5) (86) — 81 (86)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $219 $(1,130) $(1,023) $1,349 $(107)2014 Cash Flows Compared to 2013 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities including the collection of Reinsurance Program fees in advance of remittance in 2015, partially offset by an increase in government receivables.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included: (a) a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014; (b) an increase in Part D subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered; and (c) increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock.2013 Cash Flows Compared to 2012 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased due to the net effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities, including: (a) an increase in pharmacy rebates receivables stemming from the increased membership at OptumRx, the effects of which were partially offset by (b) increases in medical costs payable due to the growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets and international businesses. Other significant items contributing to the overall decrease in cash year-over-year included: (a) decreased investments in acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares (the activity in 2013 primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining publicly traded shares of Amil during the second quarter of 2013 for $1.5 billion); (b) a decrease in net proceeds from commercial paper and long-term debt, as proceeds from 2013 debt issuances were fully offset by scheduled maturities and the redemption of all of our outstanding subsidiary debt (in 2012, the increased cash flows from common stock issuances and proceeds from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt primarily related to the Amil acquisition); and (c) increased net purchases of investments. Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $27.6 billion included $7.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $738 million was available for general corporate use), $18.6 billion of debt 38Table of Contentssecurities and $1.5 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, especially those used in valuing our $384 million of available-for-sale Level 3 securities (those securities priced using significant unobservable inputs), may have an effect on the estimated fair values of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2014. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Our bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of not more than 50%. Our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, calculated as the sum of debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity, which reasonably approximates the actual covenant ratio, was 34.9% as of December 31, 2014. Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases.In December 2014, we issued $2.0 billion in senior unsecured notes, which included: $750 million of 1.4% fixed-rate notes due December 15, 2017, $500 million of 2.3% fixed-rate notes due December 15, 2019 and $750 million of 2.875% fixed-rate notes due December 15, 2021.Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2014 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable bbb+ PositiveCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/aThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. In June 2014, our Board renewed our share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 71 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Dividends. In June 2014, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $1.50 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”39Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2014, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 to 2019 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $2,103 $4,398 $3,193 $17,997 $27,691Operating leases 491 715 533 464 2,203Purchase obligations (b) 176 173 17 6 372Future policy benefits (c) 127 282 289 1,917 2,615Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 2 — — 83 85Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 207 36 — 1,321 1,564Other obligations (f) 143 126 44 33 346Redeemable noncontrolling interests (g) 83 767 538 — 1,388Total contractual obligations $3,332 $6,497 $4,614 $21,821 $36,264(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values.

(g)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries, primarily the shares owned by Amil’s remaining non-public shareholders.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2014, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 will supersede existing revenue recognition standards with a single model unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., an insurance entity’s insurance contracts). The revenue recognition principle in ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, new and enhanced disclosures will be required. Companies can adopt the new standard using either the full retrospective approach, a modified retrospective approach with practical expedients, or a cumulative effect upon adoption approach. ASU 2014-09 will become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect of the new revenue recognition guidance.40Table of ContentsWe have determined that there have been no other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2014, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $420 million, $680 million and $860 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted.41Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2014: Completion FactorsIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $318(0.50) 212(0.25) 1060.25 (105)0.50 (209)0.75 (313)Medical Cost PMPM Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design, and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates including: our ability and practices to manage medical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2014: Medical Cost PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $6352 4231 212(1) (212)(2) (423)(3) (635)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2014, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2014; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2014 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2014 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $67 million. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture, and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information, and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS 42Table of Contentsalso retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS. U.S. commercial health plans with MLRs on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in Health Reform Legislation, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% forindividuals) are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned net of projected rebates because we are able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. Each period, we estimate premium rebates based on the expected financial performance of the applicable contracts within each defined aggregation set (e.g., by state, group size and licensed subsidiary). The most significant factors in estimating the financial performance are current and future premiums and medical claim experience, effective tax rates and expected changes in business mix. The estimated ultimate premium is revised each period to reflect current and projected experience.Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step impairment test. First, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment of each reporting unit to determine whether facts and circumstances support a determination that their fair values are greater than their carrying values. If the qualitative analysis is not conclusive, or if we elect to proceed directly with quantitative testing, we will then measure the fair values of the reporting units and compare them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods, and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends, and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. •Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, due to the long-term nature of the forecasts there is significant uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, “Business - Government Regulation.” For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms and other factors could affect our business and the related long-term forecasts, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” above. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. This risk is evaluated using comparisons to market information such as peer company weighted average costs of capital and 43Table of Contentspeer company stock prices in the form of revenue and earnings multiples. Beyond our selection of the most appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premiums, our most significant estimates in the discount rate determinations involve our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. Such adjustments include the addition of size premiums and company-specific risk premiums intended to compensate for apparent forecast risk. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future.We elected to bypass the optional qualitative reporting unit fair value assessment and completed our annual quantitative tests for goodwill impairment as of January 1, 2015. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.Intangible Assets. Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and represent future expected benefits but they lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts, trademarks and technology). These intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Both finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment between annual periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Our most significant intangible assets are customer-related intangibles, which represent 71% of our total intangible asset balance of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2014.Customer-related intangible assets acquired in business combinations are typically valued using an income approach based on discounted future cash flows attributable to customers that exist as of the date of acquisition. The most significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer-related assets include: projected revenue and earnings growth, retention rates, perpetuity growth rates and discount rates. These initial valuations and the embedded assumptions contain uncertainty to the extent that those assumptions and estimates may ultimately differ from actual results (e.g., customer turnover may be higher or lower than the assumed retention rate suggested).Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value, and other factors. Following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, we would calculate the estimated fair value of a finite-lived intangible asset (or asset group) using the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets. If it is determined that an impairment exists, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value would be recorded as an impairment. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, no impairment exists and no further testing is performed. If we conclude otherwise, we would perform a quantitative analysis by comparing its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not materially impaired in 2014.Investments As of December 31, 2014, we had investments with a carrying value of $20.6 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from net earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as other comprehensive income and as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2014, our available-for-sale investments had gross unrealized gains of $423 million and gross unrealized losses of $66 million. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, and recognized in net earnings, and all other causes, and recognized in other comprehensive income. 44Table of ContentsFor equity securities, we recognize unrealized losses in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the loss in net earnings. The most significant judgments and estimates related to investments are related to determination of their fair values and the other-than-temporary impairment assessment.Fair Values. Fair values of available-for-sale debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. We obtain one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds, and non-binding broker quotes. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform quarterly analyses of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, we compare:•prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing service, our custodian, our investment consultant and third-party investment advisors; and•changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices and our expectations to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. Based on our internal price verification procedures and our review of the fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service, we have not historically adjusted the prices obtained from the pricing service. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment. Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. We do not expect that trend to change in the near term. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.Our unrealized losses of $66 million and $234 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were primarily caused by market interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit standing. We believe we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities with an amortized cost in excess of fair value. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of which are of investment-grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with our investment policy. Total other-than-temporary impairments for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $26 million, $8 million and $6 million, respectively. Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2014. We have minimal securities collateralized by sub-prime or Alt-A securities, and a minimal amount of commercial mortgage loans in default. The judgments and estimates related to fair value and other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. As discussed further in Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” a 1% increase in market interest rates would have the effect of decreasing the fair value of our investment portfolio by $683 million.45Table of ContentsIncome Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.An uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems.The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2014 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes and net earnings to change by $97 million.Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Our estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, in many cases, we are unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Similarly, the assessment of the likelihood of assertion of unasserted claims involves significant judgment. Given this inherent uncertainty, it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. We evaluate our related disclosures in each reporting period. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for a discussion of specific legal proceedings including an assessment of whether a reasonable estimate of the losses or range of loss could be determined. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and record the reinsurance receivable only to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A+.” As of December 31, 2014, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.46Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, (b) foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and (c) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments.As of December 31, 2014, we had $9.4 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2014, $12.6 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, $17.2 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $7.7 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income.The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2014Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets(b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities2 % $187 $245 $(1,364) $(1,846)1 94 122 (683) (1,014)(1) (54) (21) 628 1,242(2) nm nm 982 2,770 December 31, 2013Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets(b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities2% $175 $189 $(1,474) $(1,786)1 87 95 (756) (974)(1) (52) (17) 704 1,167(2) nm nm 1,224 2,505nm = not meaningful(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful.(b)As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2014, a hypothetical 10% and 20% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $430 million and $790 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2014, we had $1.5 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks, and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions. 47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:46.125619
731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2016,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and making the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. We offer a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct 27Table of Contentsplatforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services; and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, Brazilian and certain other international health economies. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions that impact the small group and individual markets. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group markets. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. Health Reform Legislation included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. Health Reform Legislation also included three programs designed to stabilize health insurance markets (Premium Stabilization Programs): a permanent risk adjustment program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a transitional reinsurance program (Reinsurance Program). Health plans have generally reflected the Health Insurance Industry Tax and Reinsurance Program (together, ACA Fees) in their pricing. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted pricing trends. In 2015, health plans’ pricing returned to a more normal year-over-year inflation after pricing for higher costs due to ACA Fees in 2014. As always, the intensity of pricing competition depends on local market conditions and competitive dynamics. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. This will impact our pricing for contracts that renew during 2016 but cover all or portions of 2017.Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the reimbursement rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. Consistent with our experience in recent years, our 2015 cost trends were largely driven by unit cost pressures from health care providers. In 2016, we expect continued unit cost pressure and a modest increase in utilization. We endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management. Our 2016 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs have unexpected price increases.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to 28Table of Contentswork together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider reimbursement models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2015, we served more than 14 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2015, our contracts with value-based spending total nearly $46 billion annually, up from $13 billion in 2011.This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of Health Reform Legislation and other regulatory items. For additional information regarding Health Reform Legislation and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates and Minimum Loss Ratios. Medicare Advantage rates have been cut over the last several years, with additional funding reductions to be phased-in through 2017. The final 2016 Medicare Advantage rates were more stable than in recent years, with an expected average increase in industry funding of approximately 1.25%. However, these rates still trail the typical industry forward medical cost trend of 3% which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of these cuts to our Medicare Advantage revenues is partially mitigated by reductions in provider reimbursements for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement rates. These factors affected our plan benefit designs, market participation, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans for 2016.The ongoing reductions to Medicare Advantage funding place continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate reductions. These adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.In the longer term, we also may be able to mitigate some of the effects of reduced funding by increasing enrollment due, in part, to the increasing number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. As Medicare Advantage reimbursement changes, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ star ratings. The level of star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue. Beginning in 2015, quality bonus payments were paid only to plans rated 4 stars and higher. We expect that approximately 56% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2016 compared with approximately 39% of members in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2015. We further expect that at least 63% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance.Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs. The industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax was $11.3 billion in 2015 and will remain at that level in 2016. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017, on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The Health Insurance Industry Tax will again be imposed for 2018 and beyond. In 2016, we expect that our share of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will increase to $1.9 billion from $1.8 billion in 2015 due to growth in our business. The Reinsurance Program is a temporary program that will be funded on a per capita basis from all commercial lines of business, including insured and self-funded arrangements. The total three year amount of $25 billion for the Reinsurance 29Table of ContentsProgram is allocated as follows: $20 billion (2014 - $10 billion, 2015 - $6 billion, 2016 - $4 billion) subject to increases based on state decisions, to fund the reinsurance pool and $5 billion (2014 and 2015 - $2 billion, 2016 - $1 billion) to fund the U.S. Treasury. The actual 2014 Reinsurance Program contributions totaled approximately $9.7 billion, which was $2.3 billion short of the expected amount; all was used to fund the Reinsurance Program. While funding for the Reinsurance Program will come from all commercial lines of business, only market reform compliant individual businesses will be eligible for reinsurance recoveries. We have not recorded any receivables under the temporary risk corridor program for 2014 or 2015 due to uncertainty over the level of government funding for this program and the ultimate collectability of these funds.For detail on the Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Individual Public Exchanges. After a measured approach to the individual public exchange market in 2014 in which we participated in only four states, we expanded significantly in 2015 to participate in 23 states. In 2016, we are expanding our individual public exchange offerings by 11 states to a total of 34 states. Recent data, however, has caused us to reconsider our long-term position in the individual public exchange market. We have seen lower consumer participation than we and others expected, lower government expectations for future consumer participation, declining performance in and accelerating failures of government-sponsored cooperatives and worsening of our own claims experience. We have recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results for in-force contracts as of January 1, 2016. We are not pursuing membership growth and have taken a comprehensive set of actions (e.g., increased prices and eliminated marketing and commissions) to contain membership growth. By mid-2016 we will determine to what extent, if any, we will continue to offer products in the individual public exchange market in 2017. 30Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease) 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013Revenues: Premiums $127,163 $115,302 $109,557 $11,861 10% $5,745 5%Products 17,312 4,242 3,190 13,070 308 1,052 33Services 11,922 10,151 8,997 1,771 17 1,154 13Investment and other income 710 779 745 (69) (9) 34 5Total revenues 157,107 130,474 122,489 26,633 20 7,985 7Operating costs (a): Medical costs 103,875 93,633 89,659 10,242 11 3,974 4Operating costs 24,312 21,263 18,941 3,049 14 2,322 12Cost of products sold 16,206 3,826 2,891 12,380 324 935 32Depreciation and amortization 1,693 1,478 1,375 215 15 103 7Total operating costs 146,086 120,200 112,866 25,886 22 7,334 6Earnings from operations 11,021 10,274 9,623 747 7 651 7Interest expense (790) (618) (708) 172 28 (90) (13)Earnings before income taxes 10,231 9,656 8,915 575 6 741 8Provision for income taxes (4,363) (4,037) (3,242) 326 8 795 25Net earnings 5,868 5,619 5,673 249 4 (54) (1)Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (55) — (48) 55 nm (48) nmNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders $5,813 $5,619 $5,625 $194 3 % $(6) — %Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common stockholders $6.01 $5.70 $5.50 $0.31 5 % $0.20 4 %Medical care ratio (b) 81.7% 81.2% 81.8% 0.5 % (0.6)% Operating cost ratio 15.5 16.3 15.5 (0.8) 0.8 Operating margin 7.0 7.9 7.9 (0.9) — Tax rate 42.6 41.8 36.4 0.8 5.4 Net earnings margin (c) 3.7 4.3 4.6 (0.6) (0.3) Return on equity (d) 17.7% 17.3% 17.7% 0.4 % (0.4)% nm= not meaningful(a)During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company changed its presentation of certain pharmacy fulfillment costs related to its OptumRx business.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2015 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2014 and other 2015 significant items.•Consolidated revenues increased by 20%, Optum revenues grew 42% and UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 10%. •UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 1.7 million people domestically. Each Optum business grew revenues by 19% or more.•Earnings from operations increased by 7%, including an increase of 30% at Optum partially offset by a decrease of 3% at UnitedHealthcare.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 5% to $6.01. •Cash flow from operations were $9.7 billion an increase of 21%.31Table of Contents•On July 23, 2015, we acquired Catamaran through the purchase of all of its outstanding common stock for cash. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements” for more information.2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2014 RESULTSOur results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 were affected by our acquisition of Catamaran on July 23, 2015.Consolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the Catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of Optum’s businesses. Medical CostsMedical costs increased primarily due to risk-based membership growth in our benefits businesses. Medical costs also included losses on individual exchange-compliant products related to 2015, and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for in-force individual exchange-compliant contracts and a new state Medicaid contract.Operating Cost RatioThe decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of Catamaran and growth in government benefits programs, both of which have lower operating cost ratios and Company wide productivity gains.Reportable SegmentsSee Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more information on our segments.

Medicare Advantage participation increased year-over-year primarily due to growth in people served through employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of health reform related Medicaid expansion, states launching new programs to complement established programs and growth in established programs, partially offset by a decrease of 175,000 people in one market where an additional offering was introduced by the state in the first quarter of 2015. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. The number of people served internationally decreased year-over-year primarily due to pricing and underwriting disciplines in Brazil in response to regulatory actions and declining employment levels in Brazil.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased as the combined individual exchange-compliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling $815 million more than offset strong growth across the business, improved medical cost management and increased productivity. OptumTotal revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below.33Table of ContentsThe results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services. The operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities.OptumInsightRevenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to the mid-year acquisition of Catamaran as well as strong organic growth. Operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin Catamaran business. For more information about Catamaran, see Note 3 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements.”2014 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2013 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses and growth across all of Optum’s businesses.Medical Costs and Medical Care RatioMedical costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 increased due to risk-based membership growth in our public and senior markets businesses. To the extent possible, we included the reform fees and related tax impacts in our pricing; since the ACA Fees are included in operating costs, this decreased our medical care ratio in 2014. This decrease from ACA Fees was partially offset by the impact of lower levels of favorable medical cost reserve development.Operating Cost RatioThe increase in our operating cost ratio during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to the introduction of ACA Fees and services business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by productivity and operating performance gains.Income Tax RateThe increase in our income tax rate resulted primarily from the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax. Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in the number of individuals served in our public and senior markets businesses; revenues to recover ACA Fees, which resulted in $1.5 billion of additional annual premiums in 2014; and commercial price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. These increases were partially offset by decreased commercial risk-based enrollment and a reduced level of Medicare Advantage funding.UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were pressured year-over-year by ACA Fees, Medicare Advantage funding reductions, increased spending on specialty medications to treat hepatitis C and reduced levels of favorable medical cost reserve development. Partially offsetting these factors were growth in our public and senior markets businesses, reduced levels of per-member inpatient hospital utilization and revenue true-ups.OptumTotal revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to pharmacy growth at OptumRx and growth at OptumHealth.The increases in Optum’s earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven by revenue growth and increased productivity, partially offset by investments at OptumHealth and OptumInsight.34Table of ContentsThe results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increased at OptumHealth during 2014 primarily due to acquisitions and growth in care delivery and subacute care services.Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to revenue growth and cost efficiencies, offset in part by investments to develop future growth opportunities.OptumInsightRevenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to the growth and expansion in revenue management services and government exchange services, partially offset by a reduction in hospital compliance services and investments for future growth.OptumRxIncreased OptumRx revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to growth in people served in UnitedHealthcare’s public and senior markets, the insourcing of UnitedHealthcare’s commercial pharmacy benefit programs, growth from external clients and an increase in specialty pharmaceutical revenues.Earnings from operations and operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased primarily due to growth in scale that resulted in greater productivity and better absorption of our fixed costs and improved performance in both drug purchasing and home delivery pharmacy fulfillment.LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies.In 2015, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.6 billion. See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our stockholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.35Table of ContentsSummary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)(in millions) 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $9,740 $8,051 $6,991 $1,689 $1,060Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 14,607 391 152 14,216 239Proceeds from common stock issuances 402 462 598 (60) (136)Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases — 799 — (799) 799Customer funds administered 768 — 31 768 (31)Other — 115 191 (115) (76)Total sources of cash 25,517 9,818 7,963 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares, net of cash assumed (16,282) (1,923) (1,836) (14,359) (87)Cash dividends paid (1,786) (1,362) (1,056) (424) (306)Common stock repurchases (1,200) (4,008) (3,170) 2,808 (838)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,556) (1,525) (1,307) (31) (218)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (531) — (1,611) (531) 1,611Customer funds administered — (638) — 638 (638)Other (578) (138) (27) (440) (111)Total uses of cash (21,933) (9,594) (9,007) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (156) (5) (86) (151) 81Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $3,428 $219 $(1,130) $3,209 $1,3492015 Cash Flows Compared to 2014 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in risk-based products, which increased medical costs payable and an increase in CMS risk share payables, which increased other policy liabilities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates, which increased other receivables, the increase in the payment of the 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax and the payment of Reinsurance Program fees in 2015.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases, all due to the Catamaran acquisition.2014 Cash Flows Compared to 2013 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 increased primarily due to an increased level of accounts payable and other liabilities, including the collection of Reinsurance Program fees in advance of remittance in 2015, partially offset by an increase in government receivables.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included: (a) a change in investment activity from net purchases in 2013 to net sales in 2014; (b) an increase in Part D subsidy receivables causing a change in customer funds administered; and (c) increased levels of cash used to repurchase common stock.Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2015, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $31.2 billion included $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $286 million was available for general corporate use), $18.6 billion of debt securities and $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during 36Table of Contentsadverse market conditions. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2015. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-stockholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2015, our debt to debt-plus-stockholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 47%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets and issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, for example, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In July 2015, we issued debt to fund the acquisition of Catamaran. For more information on this debt issuance, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements.”Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2015 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Negative A+ Negative A- Negative bbb+ StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/aThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. We expect continued moderated share repurchase activity through 2016 following the acquisition of Catamaran. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Dividends. In June 2015, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to stockholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”37Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2015, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2016 2017 to 2018 2019 to 2020 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $7,651 $7,938 $4,564 $26,569 $46,722Operating leases 417 695 497 471 2,080Purchase obligations (b) 365 230 54 28 677Future policy benefits (c) 133 277 283 1,936 2,629Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 4 — — 207 211Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 185 4 — 1,477 1,666Other obligations (f) 52 64 20 16 152Redeemable noncontrolling interests (g) 55 1,453 228 — 1,736Total contractual obligations $8,862 $10,661 $5,646 $30,704 $55,873(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values.

(b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. (c)Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more detail. (d)As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.”(e)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(f)Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. (g)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2015, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. 38Table of ContentsMedical Costs PayableEach reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim processing backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. As of December 31, 2015, our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times 365 days. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Therefore, in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $320 million, $420 million and $680 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Completion Factors. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2015: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $370(0.50) 246(0.25) 1230.25 (122)0.50 (244)0.75 (365)Medical Cost PMPM Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic 39Table of Contentsvariables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2015: Medical Cost PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $7272 4851 242(1) (242)(2) (485)(3) (727)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2015, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2015; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2015 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2015 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $83 million. Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We and health care providers collect, capture and submit available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS uses submitted diagnosis codes, demographic information and special statuses to determine the risk score for most Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. CMS also retroactively adjusts risk scores during the year based on additional data. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2015. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. During 2015, we changed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 of each year. The change in the goodwill impairment test date better aligns the impairment testing procedures with the timing of our long-term planning process, which is a significant input to the testing. This change in testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. Impairment tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. 40Table of ContentsTo determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level. •Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future.Intangible Assets. Our recorded separately-identifiable intangible assets were acquired in business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair values. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2015.Investments Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment. Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced that it would increase short-41Table of Contentsterm interest rates to a range between 25 and 50 basis points. Fed officials emphasized that they intend to raise rates gradually, if necessary. We estimate a 25 basis point rise in short-term interest rates impacts the fair-value of our investments by $200 million. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.The judgments and estimates related to other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors, including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2015, we had a reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” for more information. As of December 31, 2015, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real.As of December 31, 2015, we had $12.9 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2015, $12.9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2015, $17.1 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $21.9 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income.42Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2015Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities (c)2 % $258 $257 $(1,388) $(3,233)1 129 128 (702) (1,746)(1) (80) (55) 677 2,085(2) nm nm 1,132 4,442 December 31, 2014Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2% $187 $245 $(1,364) $(1,846)1 94 122 (683) (1,014)(1) (54) (21) 628 1,242(2) nm nm 982 2,770nm = not meaningful(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful.(b)As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.(c)The year over year change in the fair value of financial liabilities was driven by the issuance of debt to fund the Catamaran acquisition. For more information on our debt issuances, see Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of Amil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and Amil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $300 million and $660 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.6 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions. 43Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:45.606874
731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping to make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core 27Table of Contentscompetencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Recent DevelopmentsWe have recognized in our financial results for the fourth quarter 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2016 the previously disclosed $350 million impact of our estimated share of guaranty association assessments resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary (Penn Treaty), following accounting, legal and regulatory consultations in connection with our 10-K filing. This charge will be funded over several years and affected by premium tax credits over time.For more detail related to the Penn Treaty liquidation, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, Brazilian and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations. Our review of regulatory considerations involves a focus on minimum MLR thresholds and the risk adjustment that impacts the small group and individual markets. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2017 will reflect the impact of the moratorium. Additionally, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid net margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases with medical management. Our 2017 management activities include managing costs across all health care categories, including specialty pharmacy spending, as new therapies are introduced at high costs and older drugs experience price increases.28Table of ContentsDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2016, we served more than 15 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2016, our contracts with value-based elements total nearly $53 billion in annual spending.This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2017 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 0.85%, well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3%, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of this funding shortfall in Medicare Advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service payment rates. These factors can affect our plan benefit designs, pricing, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans.The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government and decide on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. As provided in the ACA, our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, Star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue. For the 2016 payment year, approximately 57% of our Medicare Advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher. We expect that at least 80% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2017. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and Star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance.Health Insurance Industry Tax and Premium Stabilization Programs. The industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax was $11.3 billion in 2016 and we paid our portion of the tax, which was $1.8 billion, in September 2016. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposes a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The Health Insurance Industry Tax is scheduled to be imposed for 2018 and beyond. In 2018, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax is expected to be $14.3 billion. The ACA also included three programs designed to stabilize the health insurance markets. These programs encompassed: a transitional reinsurance program; a temporary risk corridors program; and a permanent risk adjustment program. The transitional reinsurance and temporary risk corridors programs expired at the end of 2016. Individual Public Exchanges. In 2016, we participated in individual public exchanges in 34 states and offered individual ACA compliant products. We recorded a premium deficiency reserve for a portion of our estimated 2016 losses in our 2015 results 29Table of Contentsfor in-force contracts as of January 1, 2016. During 2016, we incurred additional losses in our individual ACA compliant products and, for 2017, reduced our participation to three individual public exchanges. We expect to reduce the number of consumers we serve through individual insurance plans by nearly 1 million people in 2017, which will reduce our premium revenues by more than $4 billion.RESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014Revenues: Premiums $144,118 $127,163 $115,302 $16,955 13% $11,861 10%Products 26,658 17,312 4,242 9,346 54 13,070 308Services 13,236 11,922 10,151 1,314 11 1,771 17Investment and other income 828 710 779 118 17 (69) (9)Total revenues 184,840 157,107 130,474 27,733 18 26,633 20Operating costs: Medical costs 117,038 103,875 93,633 13,163 13 10,242 11Operating costs 28,401 24,312 21,263 4,089 17 3,049 14Cost of products sold 24,416 16,206 3,826 8,210 51 12,380 324Depreciation and amortization 2,055 1,693 1,478 362 21 215 15Total operating costs 171,910 146,086 120,200 25,824 18 25,886 22Earnings from operations 12,930 11,021 10,274 1,909 17 747 7Interest expense (1,067) (790) (618) (277) 35 (172) 28Earnings before income taxes 11,863 10,231 9,656 1,632 16 575 6Provision for income taxes (4,790) (4,363) (4,037) (427) 10 (326) 8Net earnings 7,073 5,868 5,619 1,205 21 249 4Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (56) (55) — (1) 2 (55) nmNet earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $7,017 $5,813 $5,619 $1,204 21% $194 3 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $7.25 $6.01 $5.70 $1.24 21% $0.31 5 %Medical care ratio (a) 81.2% 81.7% 81.2% (0.5)% 0.5 % Operating cost ratio 15.4 15.5 16.3 (0.1) (0.8) Operating margin 7.0 7.0 7.9 — (0.9) Tax rate 40.4 42.6 41.8 (2.2) 0.8 Net earnings margin (b) 3.8 3.7 4.3 0.1 (0.6) Return on equity (c) 19.4% 17.7% 17.3% 1.7 % 0.4 % nm= not meaningful(a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders.(c)Return on equity is calculated as annualized net earnings divided by average equity.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2016 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2015 and other 2016 significant items.•Consolidated revenues increased by 18%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 13% and Optum revenues grew 24%. •UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 2.1 million people domestically.•Earnings from operations increased by 17%, including increases of 8% at UnitedHealthcare and 32% at Optum.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 21% to $7.25. •Cash flows from operations were $9.8 billion.30Table of Contents2016 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2015 RESULTSOur results of operations were affected by our acquisition of Catamaran in the third quarter of 2015.Consolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues were primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across all of our Optum services businesses.Medical Costs Medical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends, partially offset by medical management initiatives. Income Tax RateOur effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the adoption of the ASU 2016-09, which we adopted in the first quarter of 2016. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this report for more information about the adoption of ASU 2016-09.Reportable SegmentsSee Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more information on our segments.

Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of new state-based awards and growth in established programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends. The increase in UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings was due to diversified growth, offset by guaranty fund assessments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. For more information on these assessments, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Operating earnings in 2015 included the establishment of premium deficiency reserves for 2016, primarily for individual ACA compliant business. OptumTotal revenues and operating earnings increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to growth in its health care delivery businesses as well as expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. Strong performance in business supporting UnitedHealthcare partially offset by investments in the health care delivery business drove the increase in earnings from operations.32Table of ContentsOptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management, business process outsourcing and technology services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to the full-year impact of Catamaran and organic growth. In 2016, OptumRx fulfilled 1.24 billion adjusted scripts compared to 932 million in 2015.2015 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2014 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increase in revenues was primarily driven by the effect of the Catamaran acquisition and organic growth in the number of individuals served across our benefits businesses and across all of Optum’s businesses. Medical CostsMedical costs increased primarily due to risk-based membership growth in our benefits businesses. Medical costs also included losses on individual ACA compliant products related to 2015, and the establishment of premium deficiency reserves related to the 2016 policy year for anticipated future losses for in-force individual ACA compliant contracts and a new state Medicaid contract.Operating Cost RatioThe decrease in our operating cost ratio was due to the inclusion of Catamaran and growth in government benefits programs, both of which have lower operating cost ratios and Company wide productivity gains.Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased as the combined individual ACA compliant losses and premium deficiency reserves totaling $815 million more than offset strong growth across the business, improved medical cost management and increased productivity. OptumTotal revenues and operating earnings increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in its care delivery businesses and the impact of acquisitions in patient care centers and population health management services. The operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to investments made to develop future growth opportunities.OptumInsightRevenue, earnings from operations and operating margins at OptumInsight for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased primarily due to expansion and growth in care provider revenue management services and payer services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased due to the mid-year acquisition of Catamaran as well as strong organic growth. Operating margins for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly due to the inclusion of lower margin Catamaran business. 33Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies.In 2016, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.9 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.4 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change(in millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $9,795 $9,740 $8,051 $55 $1,689Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 990 14,607 391 (13,617) 14,216Proceeds from common share issuances 429 402 462 27 (60)Sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases — — 799 — (799)Customer funds administered 1,692 768 — 924 768Other 37 — 115 37 (115)Total sources of cash 12,943 25,517 9,818 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions and noncontrolling interest shares, net of cash assumed (2,017) (16,282) (1,923) 14,265 (14,359)Cash dividends paid (2,261) (1,786) (1,362) (475) (424)Common share repurchases (1,280) (1,200) (4,008) (80) 2,808Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (1,705) (1,556) (1,525) (149) (31)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (5,927) (531) — (5,396) (531)Customer funds administered — — (638) — 638Other (324) (578) (138) 254 (440)Total uses of cash (13,514) (21,933) (9,594) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 78 (156) (5) 234 (151)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(493) $3,428 $219 $(3,921) $3,20934Table of Contents2016 Cash Flows Compared to 2015 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities increased slightly as higher net earnings were mostly offset by increased CMS receivables and other operating items. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net purchases of investments in 2016 and the decreases in cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from debt issuances due to the 2015 acquisition of Catamaran. 2015 Cash Flows Compared to 2014 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 increased primarily due to growth in risk-based products, which increased medical costs payable and an increase in CMS risk share payables, which increased other liabilities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in pharmacy rebates, which increased other receivables, the increase in the payment of the 2015 Health Insurance Industry Tax and the payment of Reinsurance Program fees in 2015.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased cash paid for acquisitions and net debt issuances and decreased share repurchases, all due to the Catamaran acquisition.Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2016, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $36.7 billion included $10.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $700 million was available for general corporate use), $24.2 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2016. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2016, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities was approximately 44%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. In February 2016, we issued debt to repay commercial paper borrowings, which were incurred for general corporate and working capital purposes, and to repay our 5.375% notes that were due March 15, 2016. In December 2016, we issued debt to repay commercial paper borrowings, which were incurred for general corporate and working capital purposes. For more information on these debt issuances, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements.”Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2016 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Negative A+ Negative A- Negative bbb+ StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/a35Table of ContentsThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2016, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 51 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Dividends. In June 2016, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual dividend rate of $2.50 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2016, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2017 2018 to 2019 2020 to 2021 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $8,262 $6,282 $6,059 $27,899 $48,502Operating leases 453 771 587 499 2,310Purchase and other obligations (b) 623 617 297 170 1,707Future policy benefits (c) 133 271 273 1,980 2,657Unrecognized tax benefits (d) 19 — — 234 253Other liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (e) 269 14 5 2,288 2,576Redeemable noncontrolling interests (f) 958 1,054 — — 2,012Total contractual obligations $10,717 $9,009 $7,221 $33,070 $60,017(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more detail. (b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016. (c)Future policy benefits represent account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders, excluding surrender charges, for universal life and investment annuity products and for long-duration health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more detail. (d)As the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.”(e)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(f)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2016, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.36Table of ContentsRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2016, our days outstanding in medical payables was 51 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $220 million, $320 million and $420 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserves may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2016: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $437(0.50) 291(0.25) 1450.25 (144)0.50 (288)0.75 (430)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and 37Table of Contentspharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2016: Medical Cost PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $5572 3711 186(1) (186)(2) (371)(3) (557)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2016; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2016 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2016 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $90 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analysis. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.38Table of ContentsWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level.•Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2016. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2016.Investments Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Assessment. Individual securities with fair values lower than costs are reviewed for impairment considering the following factors: our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the length of time and extent of impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer. Other factors included in the assessment include the type and nature of the securities and their liquidity. Given the nature of our portfolio, primarily investment grade securities, historical impairments were largely market related (e.g., interest rate fluctuations) as opposed to credit related. Our large cash holdings reduce the risk that we will be required to sell a security. However, our intent to sell a security may change from period to period if facts and circumstances change.The judgments and estimates related to other-than-temporary impairment may ultimately prove to be inaccurate due to many factors, including: circumstances may change over time, industry sector and market factors may differ from expectations and estimates or we may ultimately sell a security we previously intended to hold. Our assessment of the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer may ultimately prove to be inaccurate as time passes and new information becomes available, including changes to current facts and circumstances, or as unknown or estimated unlikely trends develop. 39Table of ContentsLEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2016, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real.As of December 31, 2016, we had $13.2 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2016, $12.4 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, $21.9 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $25.2 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income.The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2016Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2 % $263 $245 $(1,711) $(3,470)1 132 122 (873) (1,860)(1) (105) (95) 855 2,244(2) nm nm 1,562 4,784 December 31, 2015Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2% $258 $257 $(1,388) $(3,233)1 129 128 (702) (1,746)(1) (80) (55) 677 2,085(2) nm nm 1,132 4,442nm = not meaningful40Table of Contents(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero and thus the 200 basis point reduction is not meaningful.(b)As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Brazil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Brazil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $400 million and $900 million, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk by conducting our international business operations primarily in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2016, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; venture capital funds; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. Valuations in venture capital funds are subject to conditions affecting health care and technology stocks and dividend paying equities are subject to more general market conditions. 41Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:45.588123

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the 25Table of Contentshealth system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence; and clinical care delivery, management and coordination to help meet the demands of the health system. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum. We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises approximately 18% of gross domestic product. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering all relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2018 reflected the impact of the returning Health Insurance Industry Tax. Conversely, the industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high quality, affordable care.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2017, we served nearly 16 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-26Table of Contentsrisk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2017, our contracts with value-based elements total nearly $65 billion in annual spending.This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2018 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 0.45%, well short of the industry forward medical cost trend of 3%, as well as the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018, described below, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The impact of this funding shortfall in Medicare Advantage is partially mitigated by reductions in provider payments for those care providers with rates indexed to Medicare Advantage revenues or Medicare fee-for-service payment rates. These factors can affect our plan benefit designs, pricing, growth prospects and earnings expectations for our Medicare Advantage plans.The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, and adjust members' benefits, implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. In addition, Star ratings affect the amount of savings a plan can use to offer supplemental benefits, which ultimately may affect the plan’s membership and revenue. For the 2017 payment year, approximately 80% of our Medicare Advantage members were in plans rated four stars or higher. We expect that at least 85% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated four stars or higher for payment year 2018. We continue to dedicate substantial resources to advance our quality scores and Star ratings to strengthen our local market programs and further improve our performance.Tax Reform. Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing United States tax law including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. The Company re-measured deferred taxes as of the date of enactment, which resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction to the net deferred tax liability and corresponding increase to earnings in 2017. With Tax Reform, we expect that our effective tax rate in 2018 will be approximately 24%. Health Insurance Industry Tax. A provision in the 2016 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2017 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. In 2018, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will be $14.3 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately $2.8 billion. A one year moratorium on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax will occur in 2019.27Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015Revenues: Premiums $158,453 $144,118 $127,163 $14,335 10% $16,955 13%Products 26,366 26,658 17,312 (292) (1) 9,346 54Services 15,317 13,236 11,922 2,081 16 1,314 11Investment and other income 1,023 828 710 195 24 118 17Total revenues 201,159 184,840 157,107 16,319 9 27,733 18Operating costs: Medical costs 130,036 117,038 103,875 12,998 11 13,163 13Operating costs 29,557 28,401 24,312 1,156 4 4,089 17Cost of products sold 24,112 24,416 16,206 (304) (1) 8,210 51Depreciation and amortization 2,245 2,055 1,693 190 9 362 21Total operating costs 185,950 171,910 146,086 14,040 8 25,824 18Earnings from operations 15,209 12,930 11,021 2,279 18 1,909 17Interest expense (1,186) (1,067) (790) (119) 11 (277) 35Earnings before income taxes 14,023 11,863 10,231 2,160 18 1,632 16Provision for income taxes (3,200) (4,790) (4,363) 1,590 (33) (427) 10Net earnings 10,823 7,073 5,868 3,750 53 1,205 21Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (265) (56) (55) (209) 373 (1) 2Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $10,558 $7,017 $5,813 $3,541 50 % $1,204 21%Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $10.72 $7.25 $6.01 $3.47 48 % $1.24 21%Medical care ratio (a) 82.1% 81.2% 81.7% 0.9 % (0.5)% Operating cost ratio 14.7 15.4 15.5 (0.7) (0.1) Operating margin 7.6 7.0 7.0 0.6 — Tax rate 22.8 40.4 42.6 (17.6) (2.2) Net earnings margin (b) 5.2 3.8 3.7 1.4 0.1 Return on equity (c) 24.4% 19.4% 17.7% 5.0 % 1.7 % (a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders.(c)Return on equity is calculated as annualized net earnings divided by average equity.

SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2017 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2016 and other 2017 significant items.•Consolidated revenues increased by 9%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 10% and Optum revenues grew 9%. •UnitedHealthcare grew to serve an additional 1.1 million people domestically.•Earnings from operations increased by 18%, including increases of 16% at UnitedHealthcare and 19% at Optum.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 48% to $10.72, including $1.22 per share due to the impact of Tax Reform. •Cash flows from operations were $13.6 billion, an increase of 39%.28Table of Contents2017 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2016 RESULTS.Consolidated Financial ResultsRevenueThe increase in revenue was primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across the Optum business. The increase was partially offset by revenue decreases due to the withdrawals of the ACA-compliant products in the individual market and the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium. Medical Costs and MCRMedical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends. The MCR increased due to the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, offset primarily by the reduction in individual ACA business, medical management initiatives and an increase in favorable medical cost reserve development. Income Tax RateOur effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of Tax Reform and the Health Insurance Tax moratorium. The provision for income taxes included the $1.2 billion benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.Reportable SegmentsSee Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more information on our segments.

Fee-based commercial group business declined due to the non-renewal of one public sector customer. Membership in individual business decreased due to our reduced participation in ACA-compliant products in 2017. Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. Medicaid growth was driven by the combination of new state-based awards and growth in established programs. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which were partially offset by the reduction of people served in ACA-compliant individual products and the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium.The increase in UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations was led by diversified growth and increased operating margin. The 2016 results included losses in ACA-complaint individual products and guaranty fund assessments.OptumTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery.30Table of ContentsOptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management services and business process services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to client and consumer growth. In 2017, OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts compared to 1.2 billion in 2016.2016 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2015 RESULTSOur results of operations were affected by our acquisition of Catamaran in the third quarter of 2015.Consolidated Financial ResultsRevenuesThe increases in revenues were primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across all of our Optum services businesses.Medical CostsMedical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends, partially offset by medical management initiatives. Income Tax RateOur effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the adoption of “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which we adopted in the first quarter of 2016. Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends. UnitedHealthcare’s operating earnings increased due to diversified growth, offset by guaranty fund assessments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.OptumTotal revenues and operating earnings increased as each reporting segment increased revenues and earnings from operations by double-digit percentages as a result of the factors discussed below.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to growth in its health care delivery businesses as well as expansion of behavioral services into new Medicaid markets. Strong performance in business supporting UnitedHealthcare partially offset by investments in the health care delivery business drove the increase in earnings from operations.OptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management, business process outsourcing and technology services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to the full-year impact of Catamaran and organic growth. In 2016, OptumRx fulfilled 1.2 billion adjusted scripts compared to 932 million in 2015.31Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies.In 2017, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.9 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change(in millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $13,596 $9,795 $9,740 $3,801 $55Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments — 990 14,607 (990) (13,617)Proceeds from common share issuances 688 429 402 259 27Customer funds administered 3,172 1,692 768 1,480 924Other — 37 — (37) 37Total sources of cash 17,456 12,943 25,517 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (2,131) (1,760) (16,164) (371) 14,404Cash dividends paid (2,773) (2,261) (1,786) (512) (475)Common share repurchases (1,500) (1,280) (1,200) (220) (80)Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of issuances (2,615) — — (2,615) —Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,023) (1,705) (1,556) (318) (149)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (4,319) (5,927) (531) 1,608 (5,396)Other (539) (581) (696) 42 115Total uses of cash (15,900) (13,514) (21,933) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (5) 78 (156) (83) 234Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $1,551 $(493) $3,428 $2,044 $(3,921)32Table of Contents2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash FlowsIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by the change in net deferred tax liabilities driven by tax reform.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances, which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments. 2016 Cash Flows Compared to 2015 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities increased slightly as higher net earnings were mostly offset by increased CMS receivables and other operating items. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net purchases of investments in 2016 and the decreases in cash paid for acquisitions and proceeds from debt issuances due to the 2015 acquisition of Catamaran.Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $42.4 billion included $12.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which approximately $800 million was available for general corporate use), $28.4 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2017. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 55%. As of December 31, 2017, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was approximately 37%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements.”Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2017 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A+ Negative (a) A- Stable bbb+ StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/a (a)In January 2018, S&P Global affirmed our ratings and changed our outlook to Stable.The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic 33Table of Contentsand market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2017, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 42 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Dividends. In June 2017, our Board increased our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders by 20% to an annual dividend rate of $3.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2017, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2018 2019 to 2020 2021 to 2022 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $4,006 $7,017 $7,241 $30,609 $48,873Operating leases 538 884 851 809 3,082Purchase and other obligations (b) 833 866 462 293 2,454Other liabilities (c) 823 284 284 5,589 6,980Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d) 1,575 358 25 231 2,189Total contractual obligations $7,775 $9,409 $8,863 $37,531 $63,578(a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more detail. (b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017. (c)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(d)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as “Thereafter.”Pending Acquisitions. In December 2017, we entered into agreements to acquire two companies in the health care sector for a total of approximately $7.7 billion, which are not reflected in the table above. One of the acquisitions closed in January 2018; the other is expected to close later in 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2017, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent 34Table of Contentsperiods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2017, our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2017, 2016 and 2015 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $690 million, $220 million and $320 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2017: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $486(0.50) 323(0.25) 1610.25 (160)0.50 (320)0.75 (478)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as gross-domestic product growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. 35Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2017: Medical Cost PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $6232 4151 208(1) (208)(2) (415)(3) (623)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2017; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2017 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2017 net earnings would have increased or decreased by $110 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates 36Table of Contentsfor determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends above and the discussion in the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level.•Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of October 1, 2017. All of our reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2017.LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2017, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real.As of December 31, 2017, we had $15 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2017, $8.5 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.37Table of ContentsThe fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, $25.9 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $28.7 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income.The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2017Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2 % $300 $170 $(1,958) $(4,546)1 150 85 (933) (2,460)(1) (150) (85) 950 2,923(2) (197) (133) 1,773 6,414 December 31, 2016Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2% $263 $245 $(1,711) $(3,470)1 132 122 (873) (1,860)(1) (105) (95) 855 2,244(2) nm nm 1,562 4,784 nm = not meaningful(a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction, respectively, in interest income or interest expense, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as the rate cannot fall below zero.(b)As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Brazil’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Brazil’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in Brazilian real. For example, as of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $500 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2017, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 38Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:35.095955

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding 24Table of Contentsfinancial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within our two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which have impacted and could further impact our results of operations.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs amid reform changes. The ACA included an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover a portion of calendar year 2019 reflected the impact of the moratorium. The industry has continued to experience favorable medical cost trends due to moderated utilization, which has impacted the competitive pricing environment. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect continued Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.25Table of ContentsDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2018, we served nearly 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2018, our contracts with value-based elements totaled $74 billion in annual spending, including $18 billion through risk-transfer agreements.This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2019 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of 3.4%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, which creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing pressure on Medicare Advantage funding places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments will impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.As Medicare Advantage payments change, other products may become relatively more attractive to Medicare beneficiaries and increase the demand for other senior health benefits products, such as our market-leading Medicare Supplement and stand-alone Medicare Part D insurance offerings. Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. Tax Reform. Tax Reform was enacted by the U.S federal government in December 2017, changing existing United States tax law, including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate. In 2018, the impact of Tax Reform was partially offset by the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax.Health Insurance Industry Tax. After a moratorium in 2017, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2018 was $14.3 billion, with our portion being $2.6 billion. The return of the tax impacted year-over-year comparability of our financial results, including revenues, the medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio and effective tax rate. A one year moratorium is imposed on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019.SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2018 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2017.•Consolidated revenues increased by 12%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 12% and Optum revenues grew 11%. •UnitedHealthcare’s addition of 2.2 million people through acquisition and 250,000 through organic growth was offset by 2.9 million fewer people served as a result of completion of its commitment under the TRICARE military health care program.•Earnings from operations increased by 14%, including increases of 7% at UnitedHealthcare and 23% at Optum.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 14% to $12.19. •Cash flows from operations were $15.7 billion, an increase of 16%.26Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016Revenues: Premiums $178,087 $158,453 $144,118 $19,634 12% $14,335 10%Products 29,601 26,366 26,658 3,235 12 (292) (1)Services 17,183 15,317 13,236 1,866 12 2,081 16Investment and other income 1,376 1,023 828 353 35 195 24Total revenues 226,247 201,159 184,840 25,088 12 16,319 9Operating costs: Medical costs 145,403 130,036 117,038 15,367 12 12,998 11Operating costs 34,074 29,557 28,401 4,517 15 1,156 4Cost of products sold 26,998 24,112 24,416 2,886 12 (304) (1)Depreciation and amortization 2,428 2,245 2,055 183 8 190 9Total operating costs 208,903 185,950 171,910 22,953 12 14,040 8Earnings from operations 17,344 15,209 12,930 2,135 14 2,279 18Interest expense (1,400) (1,186) (1,067) (214) 18 (119) 11Earnings before income taxes 15,944 14,023 11,863 1,921 14 2,160 18Provision for income taxes (3,562) (3,200) (4,790) (362) 11 1,590 (33)Net earnings 12,382 10,823 7,073 1,559 14 3,750 53Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (396) (265) (56) (131) 49 (209) 373Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $11,986 $10,558 $7,017 $1,428 14% $3,541 50 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $12.19 $10.72 $7.25 $1.47 14% $3.47 48 %Medical care ratio (a) 81.6% 82.1% 81.2% (0.5)% 0.9 % Operating cost ratio 15.1 14.7 15.4 0.4 (0.7) Operating margin 7.7 7.6 7.0 0.1 0.6 Tax rate 22.3 22.8 40.4 (0.5) (17.6) Net earnings margin (b) 5.3 5.2 3.8 0.1 1.4 Return on equity (c) 24.4% 24.4% 19.4% — % 5.0 % (a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders.(c)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

The MCR decreased due to the revenue effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which more than offset business mix changes and a lower level of favorable reserve development.27Table of ContentsReportable SegmentsSee Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information on our segments.

Fee-based commercial group business declined primarily due to customers converting their retirees to Medicare Advantage plans, as well as certain customers expanding the number of carriers and reconfiguring geographies served. Medicare Advantage increased year-over-year due to growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states adding new carriers to existing programs, reduced enrollment from state efforts to manage eligibility status and the sale of our New Mexico Medicaid plan. Medicare Supplement growth reflected strong customer retention and new sales. International growth was primarily driven by an acquisition in the first quarter.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served across its risk-based businesses, a higher revenue membership mix, rate increases for underlying medical cost trends and the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. UnitedHealthcare’s operating margin decreased slightly due to the performance of our traditional community-based TANF Medicaid business.OptumTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below, as well as productivity and overall cost management initiatives. The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery and behavioral health, digital consumer engagement and health financial services.OptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in data analytics product and service offerings and managed services as well as organic and acquisition-related growth in advisory services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to growth in specialty pharmacy, home delivery services, and overall prescription growth. OptumRx fulfilled 1,343 million and 1,298 million adjusted scripts in 2018 and 2017, respectively.29Table of Contents2017 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2016 RESULTSConsolidated Financial ResultsRevenueThe increase in revenue was primarily driven by organic growth in the number of individuals served across our UnitedHealthcare benefits businesses and growth across the Optum business. The increase was partially offset by revenue decreases due to the withdrawals of the ACA-compliant products in the individual market and the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium.Medical Costs and MCRMedical costs increased due to risk-based membership growth and medical cost trends. The MCR increased due to the effects of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium, offset primarily by the reduction in individual ACA business, medical management initiatives and an increase in favorable medical cost reserve development.Income Tax RateOur effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the impact of Tax Reform and the Health Insurance Tax moratorium. The provision for income taxes included a $1.2 billion benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.Reportable SegmentsUnitedHealthcareUnitedHealthcare’s revenue increase was due to growth in the number of individuals served across its businesses and price increases for underlying medical cost trends, which were partially offset by the reduction of people served in ACA-compliant individual products and the impact of the Health Insurance Industry Tax moratorium.The increase in UnitedHealthcare’s earnings from operations was led by diversified growth and increased operating margin. The 2016 results included losses in ACA-compliant individual products and guaranty fund assessments.OptumTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings from operations increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic and acquisition-related growth in care delivery.OptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in revenue management services and business process services. OptumRxRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumRx increased primarily due to client and consumer growth. In 2017, OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts compared to 1.2 billion in 2016.LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to financial regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of 30Table of Contentsstatutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies.In both 2018 and 2017, our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.7 billion. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change Change(in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $15,713 $13,596 $9,795 $2,117 $3,801Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 4,134 — 990 4,134 (990)Proceeds from common share issuances 838 688 429 150 259Customer funds administered — 3,172 1,692 (3,172) 1,480Other — — 37 — (37)Total sources of cash 20,685 17,456 12,943 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (5,997) (2,131) (1,760) (3,866) (371)Cash dividends paid (3,320) (2,773) (2,261) (547) (512)Common share repurchases (4,500) (1,500) (1,280) (3,000) (220)Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of issuances — (2,615) — 2,615 (2,615)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,063) (2,023) (1,705) (40) (318)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (4,099) (4,319) (5,927) 220 1,608Other (1,743) (539) (581) (1,204) 42Total uses of cash (21,722) (15,900) (13,514) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (78) (5) 78 (73) (83)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(1,115) $1,551 $(493) $(2,666) $2,0442018 Cash Flows Compared to 2017 Cash FlowsIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings in 2018 and the impact to 2017 cash flows from operating activities due to a change in net deferred tax liabilities from Tax Reform, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts.Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net issuances of debt in 2018 compared to net repayments in 2017, an increase in cash paid for acquisitions, increased share repurchases and a decrease in customer funds administered due to the timing of government payments.2017 Cash Flows Compared to 2016 Cash FlowsIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings and changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by the change in net deferred tax liabilities driven by tax reform.31Table of ContentsOther significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of debt compared to 2016 net proceeds from debt issuances, which were partially offset by lower net purchases of investments. Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2018, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $44.7 billion included $10.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $925 million was available for general corporate use), $31.9 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2018. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%. As of December 31, 2018, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2018 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- StableCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/aThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2018, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 94 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Dividends. In June 2018, our Board increased our annual cash dividend rate to shareholders to $3.60 per share from $3.00 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”32Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2018, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2019 2020 to 2021 2022 to 2023 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $3,463 $8,970 $7,396 $37,988 $57,817Operating leases 669 1,103 761 1,343 3,876Purchase and other obligations (b) 1,216 2,205 808 175 4,404Other liabilities (c) 1,206 260 257 5,213 6,936Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d) 1,276 380 25 227 1,908Total contractual obligations $7,830 $12,918 $9,247 $44,946 $74,941 (a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more detail. (b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018. (c)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements, unrecognized tax benefits and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(d)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as “Thereafter.”Pending Acquisitions. In December 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire a company in the health care sector for a total of approximately $4.3 billion, which is not reflected in the table above.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2018, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2018, our days outstanding in medical payables was 50 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. 33Table of ContentsIn each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2018, 2017 and 2016 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $320 million, $690 million and $220 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim inventory levels and claim processing backlogs, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2018: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $550(0.50) 366(0.25) 1820.25 (181)0.50 (362)0.75 (541)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2018: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $7032 4691 234(1) (234)(2) (469)(3) (703)34Table of ContentsThe completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2018; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2018 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2018 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $140 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Revenues We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services. Our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under the CMS risk adjustment payment methodology. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. As a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimations, the actual amount of CMS’ retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates. This may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our Medicare premium revenue and, accordingly, our profitability. For more detail on premium revenues, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Risk adjustment data for our plans is subject to review by the federal and state governments, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information regarding these audits. Our estimates of premiums to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum MLR rebates payable by us. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends and the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level.35Table of Contents•Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. As of October 1, 2018, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. Intangible Assets. Our finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that an asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. Consideration is given on a quarterly basis to a number of potential impairment indicators, including: changes in the use of the assets, changes in legal or other business factors that could affect value, experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, adverse changes in customer populations, adverse competitive or technological advances that could impact value and other factors. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. To determine if an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. Intangible assets were not impaired in 2018.LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2018, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.As of December 31, 2018, we had $14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2018, $9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, $30 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $32 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities are reported in comprehensive income.36Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2018Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum InterestExpense PerAnnum Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2 % $276 $189 $(2,242) $(5,017)1 138 94 (1,140) (2,724)(1) (138) (94) 1,118 3,155(2) (276) (189) 2,196 6,953 December 31, 2017Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (b) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2% $300 $170 $(1,958) $(4,546)1 150 85 (933) (2,460)(1) (150) (85) 950 2,923(2) (197) (133) 1,773 6,414 (a)Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense in 2017, as the rate cannot fall below zero.(b)As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the spot rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $600 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 37Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:43.027669

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Discussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.24Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone. Through our diversified businesses, we leverage core competencies in data analytics and health information; advanced technology; and clinical expertise. These core competencies are deployed within two distinct, but strategically aligned, business platforms: health benefits operating under UnitedHealthcare and health services operating under Optum.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, UnitedHealthcare and Optum:•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global;•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight; and•OptumRx.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. The ACA, which includes three distinct taxes (ACA Tax), has an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. A provision in the 2018 federal budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. Pricing for contracts that cover some portion of calendar year 2020 reflect the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. The ACA Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe that the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates that are commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying incentive-based care provider payment models that reward high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.25Table of ContentsWe are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2019, we served over 17 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. As of December 31, 2019, our contracts with value-based elements totaled $79 billion in annual spending, including $20 billion through risk-transfer agreements.This trend is creating needs for health management services that can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2020 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 2.5%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend. This combined with the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax creates continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums that supplement the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. ACA Tax. A provision in the 2019 Federal Budget imposed a one year moratorium for 2019 on the collection of the Health Insurance Industry Tax. In 2020, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, which is primarily borne by customers, will be $15.5 billion and we expect our portion to be approximately $3.0 billion. The ACA Tax was repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021.SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2019 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2018.•Consolidated revenues increased by 7%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 6% and Optum revenues grew 12%. •UnitedHealthcare served 575,000 additional people domestically as a result of growth in commercial business and services to seniors, partially offset by the proactive withdrawal from the Iowa medicaid market.•Earnings from operations increased by 13%, including increases of 13% at UnitedHealthcare and 14% at Optum.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 18% to $14.33. •Cash flows from operations were $18.5 billion, an increase of 18%.26Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018Revenues: Premiums $189,699 $178,087 $158,453 $11,612 7%Products 31,597 29,601 26,366 1,996 7Services 18,973 17,183 15,317 1,790 10Investment and other income 1,886 1,376 1,023 510 37Total revenues 242,155 226,247 201,159 15,908 7Operating costs: Medical costs 156,440 145,403 130,036 11,037 8Operating costs 35,193 34,074 29,557 1,119 3Cost of products sold 28,117 26,998 24,112 1,119 4Depreciation and amortization 2,720 2,428 2,245 292 12Total operating costs 222,470 208,903 185,950 13,567 6Earnings from operations 19,685 17,344 15,209 2,341 13Interest expense (1,704) (1,400) (1,186) (304) 22Earnings before income taxes 17,981 15,944 14,023 2,037 13Provision for income taxes (3,742) (3,562) (3,200) (180) 5Net earnings 14,239 12,382 10,823 1,857 15Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (400) (396) (265) (4) 1Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $13,839 $11,986 $10,558 $1,853 15%Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $14.33 $12.19 $10.72 $2.14 18%Medical care ratio (a) 82.5% 81.6% 82.1% 0.9 % Operating cost ratio 14.5 15.1 14.7 (0.6) Operating margin 8.1 7.7 7.6 0.4 Tax rate 20.8 22.3 22.8 (1.5) Net earnings margin (b) 5.7 5.3 5.2 0.4 Return on equity (c) 25.7% 24.4% 24.4% 1.3 % (a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders.(c)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

Medicare Advantage increased due to the growth in people served through individual and employer-sponsored group Medicare Advantage plans. The decrease in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by the proactive withdrawal from the Iowa market as well as by states adding new carriers to existing programs and managing eligibility, partially offset by increases in Dual Special Needs Plans. The decrease in people served internationally is a result of our continued affordability efforts and underwriting discipline.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue and earnings from operations increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Commercial and Medicare Advantage, including a greater mix of people with a higher acuity needs. Revenue increases were partially offset by the moratorium on the Health Insurance Industry Tax in 2019. Earnings from operations were also favorably impacted by operating cost management. OptumTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased as each segment reported increased revenues and earnings from operations as a result of the factors discussed below. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity and overall cost management initiatives. The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue increased at OptumHealth primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in care delivery, increased care services and organic growth in behavioral health services. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to care delivery. OptumHealth served approximately 96 million and 93 million people as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.OptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to organic and acquisition growth in managed services. OptumRxRevenue at OptumRx increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by an expected large client transition. Earnings from operations increased primarily due to the factors that increased revenue as well as improved supply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 1,340 million and 1,343 million adjusted scripts in 2019 and 2018, respectively, with 2019 impacted by the large client transition.29Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimal levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdiction, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $5.6 billion and $3.7 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations that are available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31, Change(in millions) 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $18,463 $15,713 $13,596 $2,750Issuances of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of repayments 3,994 4,134 — (140)Proceeds from common share issuances 1,037 838 688 199Customer funds administered 13 — 3,172 13Other 219 — — 219Total sources of cash 23,726 20,685 17,456 Uses of cash: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (8,343) (5,997) (2,131) (2,346)Cash dividends paid (3,932) (3,320) (2,773) (612)Common share repurchases (5,500) (4,500) (1,500) (1,000)Repayments of long-term debt and commercial paper, net of issuances — — (2,615) —Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (2,071) (2,063) (2,023) (8)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,504) (4,099) (4,319) 1,595Other (1,237) (1,743) (539) 506Total uses of cash (23,587) (21,722) (15,900) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (20) (78) (5) 58Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $119 $(1,115) $1,551 $1,23430Table of Contents2019 Cash Flows Compared to 2018 Cash FlowsIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings as well as changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in cash paid for acquisitions, increased share repurchases and decreased net purchases of investments.Financial ConditionAs of December 31, 2019, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $49.1 billion included $11.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $584 million was available for general corporate use), $36.1 billion of debt securities and $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.4 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2019. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityIn addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:Commercial Paper and Bank Credit Facilities. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2019, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 39%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings as of December 31, 2019 were as follows: Moody’s S&P Global Fitch A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings OutlookSenior unsecured debtA3 Stable A+ Stable A- Stable A- PositiveCommercial paperP-2 n/a A-1 n/a F1 n/a AMB-1 n/aThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2019, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 72 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Dividends. In June 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $4.32 compared to $3.60 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”31Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2019, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2020 2021 to 2022 2023 to 2024 Thereafter TotalDebt (a) $5,532 $9,118 $6,122 $44,302 $65,074Operating leases 804 1,327 901 1,671 4,703Purchase and other obligations (b) 1,617 2,483 768 248 5,116Other liabilities (c) 914 344 285 7,767 9,310Redeemable noncontrolling interests (d) 852 542 — 332 1,726Total contractual obligations $9,719 $13,814 $8,076 $54,320 $85,929 (a)Includes interest coupon payments and maturities at par or put values. The table also assumes amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more detail. (b)Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019. (c)Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, amounts accrued for guaranty fund assessments, unrecognized tax benefits, and various long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions, future settlements, unrecognized tax benefits and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter.”(d)Includes commitments for redeemable shares of our subsidiaries. When the timing of the redemption is indeterminable, the commitment has been classified as “Thereafter.”We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSAs of December 31, 2019, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2019, our days outstanding in medical payables was 51 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current 32Table of Contentsperiod (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2019, 2018 and 2017 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $580 million, $320 million and $690 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2019: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)(0.75)% $584(0.50) 388(0.25) 1940.25 (193)0.50 (384)0.75 (575)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, including but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes and epidemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2019: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable (in millions)3% $7542 5021 251(1) (251)(2) (502)(3) (754)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2019; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2019 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs 33Table of Contentspayable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2019 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $160 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a multi-step test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flows, which include assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.Forecasts and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Key assumptions used in these forecasts include:•Revenue trends. Key revenue drivers for each reporting unit are determined and assessed. Significant factors include: customer and/or membership growth, medical trends and the impact and expectations of regulatory environments. Additional macro-economic assumptions relating to unemployment, GDP growth, interest rates and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate.•Medical cost trends. For further discussion of medical cost trends, see the “Medical Cost Trend” section of Executive Overview-Business Trends and the “Medical Costs Payable” critical accounting estimate above. Similar factors, including historical and expected medical cost trend levels, are considered in estimating our long-term medical trends at the reporting unit level.•Operating productivity. We forecast expected operating cost levels based on historical levels and expectations of future operating cost levels.•Capital levels. The operating and long-term capital requirements for each business are considered.Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital that reflect reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. As of October 1, 2019, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. 34Table of ContentsConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers that constitute our client base. As of December 31, 2019, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.As of December 31, 2019, we had $14 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2019, $9 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, $33 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $39 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by endeavoring to match our floating-rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages): December 31, 2019Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum InterestExpense PerAnnum Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2 % $282 $185 $(2,668) $(6,813)1 141 93 (1,331) (3,704)(1) (141) (93) 1,246 4,433(2) (282) (185) 2,071 9,613 December 31, 2018Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum InterestExpense PerAnnum Fair Value ofFinancial Assets (a) Fair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2% $276 $189 $(2,242) $(5,017)1 138 94 (1,140) (2,724)(1) (138) (94) 1,118 3,155(2) (276) (189) 2,196 6,953 (a)As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $600 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2019, we had $2.0 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds; employee savings plan related investments; and dividend paying stocks. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 35Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:22.698426

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, “Financial Statements.” Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Discussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare:•OptumHealth;•OptumInsight;•OptumRx; and•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”COVID-19 Trends and UncertaintiesThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. During the second quarter, the global health system experienced unprecedented levels of care deferral, which impacted all of our businesses. As the pandemic advanced, access to and demand for care was most constrained from mid-March through April, began to recover in May and June and restored to near normal seasonal levels in the third quarter. Care patterns continued to normalize in the fourth quarter, returning to, and even exceeding, seasonal baselines, including COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, towards the end of the quarter. The temporary deferral of care experienced in 2020 may cause care patterns to moderately exceed normal baselines in future periods as utilization of health system capacity continues to increase. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows:Optum. The temporary deferral of care impacted the Optum businesses for the year ended December 31, 2020. For example, our fee-for-service care delivery business, such as traditional procedure work at our ambulatory surgery centers, was negatively impacted, while our risk-based care delivery business performance reflected lower demand for care. Our OptumInsight and OptumRx volume-based businesses were negatively impacted by the lower level of care encounters which took place, as well as by broader economic factors, contributing to lower managed services and prescription volume. As the health system returned to normal seasonally adjusted levels of care, we have seen business activity approach normal levels. COVID-19 will also continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of COVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services Optum provides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain.25Table of ContentsUnitedHealthcare. During 2020, we expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy benefits; provided customers assistance in the form of co-pay waivers and premium forgiveness; offered additional enrollment opportunities to those who previously declined employer-sponsored offerings; extended certain premium payment terms for customers experiencing financial hardship; simplified administrative practices; and accelerated payments to care providers, all with the aim of assisting our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Temporary care deferrals significantly impacted UnitedHealthcare’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact of temporary care deferrals was offset by COVID-19 related care and testing, the significant financial assistance we provided our customers, rebate requirements and broader economic impacts. Enrollment in our commercial products declined primarily due to employer actions in response to the pandemic. Increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, along with continued COVID-19 care and testing costs are expected to result in increased future medical costs. Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, may temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting future revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of policies and initiatives to address COVID-19, and general economic uncertainty.Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in both the small group and large group segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. The ACA had an annual, nondeductible insurance industry tax (Health Insurance Industry Tax) to be levied proportionally across the insurance industry for risk-based health insurance products. Pricing for contracts covering some portion of calendar year 2021 reflected the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Industry Tax.Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and increases in the number of people we serve; we also believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states who are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 care and testing costs and certain of our customer assistance initiatives have also impacted medical cost trends in the current year and may continue in future years. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. The uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which could result in increased variability to medical cost reserve development in future periods.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying performance-based care provider payment models rewarding high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.We are increasingly rewarding care providers for delivering improvements in quality and cost-efficiency. As of December 31, 2020, we served nearly 18 million people through some form of aligned contractual arrangement, including full-risk, shared-risk and bundled episode-of-care and performance incentive payment approaches. 26Table of ContentsThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to some of the key provisions of the ACA and other regulatory matters. For additional information regarding the ACA and regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2021 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 1.7%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. ACA Tax. After a moratorium in 2019, the industry-wide amount of the Health Insurance Industry Tax for 2020, which was primarily borne by customers, was $15.5 billion, with our portion being approximately $3.0 billion. The return of the tax impacted year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations. The Health Insurance Industry Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021.SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2020 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2019.•Consolidated revenues increased by 6%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 4% and Optum revenues grew 21%. •UnitedHealthcare served 420,000 fewer people domestically primarily due to increased unemployment and attrition in commercial group benefits, partially offset by growth in government programs.•Earnings from operations increased by 14%, including increases of 20% at UnitedHealthcare and 7% at Optum.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 12% to $16.03. •Cash flows from operations were $22.2 billion, an increase of 20%.•Return on equity was 24.9%.27Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)For the Years Ended December 31,Change2020201920182020 vs. 2019Revenues:Premiums$201,478 $189,699 $178,087 $11,779 6 %Products34,145 31,597 29,601 2,548 8 Services20,016 18,973 17,183 1,043 5 Investment and other income1,502 1,886 1,376 (384)(20)Total revenues257,141 242,155 226,247 14,986 6 Operating costs:Medical costs159,396 156,440 145,403 2,956 2 Operating costs41,704 35,193 34,074 6,511 19 Cost of products sold30,745 28,117 26,998 2,628 9 Depreciation and amortization2,891 2,720 2,428 171 6 Total operating costs234,736 222,470 208,903 12,266 6 Earnings from operations22,405 19,685 17,344 2,720 14 Interest expense(1,663)(1,704)(1,400)41 (2)Earnings before income taxes20,742 17,981 15,944 2,761 15 Provision for income taxes(4,973)(3,742)(3,562)(1,231)33 Net earnings15,769 14,239 12,382 1,530 11 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(366)(400)(396)34 (9)Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$15,403 $13,839 $11,986 $1,564 11 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$16.03 $14.33 $12.19 $1.70 12 %Medical care ratio (a)79.1 %82.5 %81.6 %(3.4)%Operating cost ratio16.2 14.5 15.1 1.7 Operating margin8.7 8.1 7.7 0.6 Tax rate24.0 20.8 22.3 3.2 Net earnings margin (b)6.0 5.7 5.3 0.3 Return on equity (c)24.9 %25.7 %24.4 %(0.8)%________ (a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders.(c)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

The increases were partially offset by decreased individuals served through our commercial and Global benefits businesses, certain voluntary customer assistance programs and rebate requirements. Revenues were also negatively impacted by decreases in our fee-for-service care delivery and other volume-based businesses, primarily as a result of the care deferral and economic impacts of COVID-19.Medical Costs and MCRMedical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, medical cost trends and COVID-19 care and testing costs, partially offset by decreased people served in commercial and Global, modestly lower care patterns and increased prior year favorable development. The MCR decreased primarily due to the temporary deferral of care and the revenue effects of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, partially offset by COVID-19 care and testing costs, rebate requirements and voluntary customer assistance measures. 28Table of ContentsOperating Cost RatioThe operating cost ratio increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, COVID-19 response efforts and business mix, partially offset by operating efficiency gains.Income Tax RateOur effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of the return of the nondeductible Health Insurance Industry Tax.Reportable SegmentsSee Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by OptumHealth and adjusted scripts for OptumRx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 2019RevenuesUnitedHealthcare$200,875 $193,842 $183,476 $7,033 4 %OptumHealth39,808 30,317 24,145 9,491 31 OptumInsight10,802 10,006 9,008 796 8 OptumRx87,498 74,288 69,536 13,210 18 Optum eliminations(1,800)(1,661)(1,409)(139)8 Optum136,308 112,950 101,280 23,358 21 Eliminations(80,042)(64,637)(58,509)(15,405)24 Consolidated revenues$257,141 $242,155 $226,247 $14,986 6 %Earnings from operationsUnitedHealthcare$12,359 $10,326 $9,113 $2,033 20 %OptumHealth3,434 2,963 2,430 471 16 OptumInsight2,725 2,494 2,243 231 9 OptumRx3,887 3,902 3,558 (15)— Optum10,046 9,359 8,231 687 7 Consolidated earnings from operations$22,405 $19,685 $17,344 $2,720 14 %Operating marginUnitedHealthcare6.2 %5.3 %5.0 %0.9 %OptumHealth8.6 9.8 10.1 (1.2)OptumInsight25.2 24.9 24.9 0.3 OptumRx4.4 5.3 5.1 (0.9)Optum7.4 8.3 8.1 (0.9)Consolidated operating margin8.7 %8.1 %7.7 %0.6 %UnitedHealthcareThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 2019UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual$55,872 $56,945 $54,761 $(1,073)(2)%UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement90,764 83,252 75,473 7,512 9 UnitedHealthcare Community & State46,487 43,790 43,426 2,697 6 UnitedHealthcare Global7,752 9,855 9,816 (2,103)(21)Total UnitedHealthcare revenues$200,875 $193,842 $183,476 $7,033 4 %29Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: December 31,Change(in thousands, except percentages)2020201920182020 vs. 2019Commercial:Risk-based7,910 8,575 8,495 (665)(8)%Fee-based18,310 19,185 18,420 (875)(5)Total commercial26,220 27,760 26,915 (1,540)(6)Medicare Advantage5,710 5,270 4,945 440 8 Medicaid6,620 5,900 6,450 720 12 Medicare Supplement (Standardized)4,460 4,500 4,545 (40)(1)Total public and senior16,790 15,670 15,940 1,120 7 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical43,010 43,430 42,855 (420)(1)Global5,425 5,720 6,220 (295)(5)Total UnitedHealthcare - medical48,435 49,150 49,075 (715)(1)%Supplemental Data:Medicare Part D stand-alone4,045 4,405 4,710 (360)(8)%Fee-based and risk-based commercial business decreased primarily due to increased unemployment and related attrition. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states easing redetermination requirements due to COVID-19 and growth in people served via Dual Special Needs Plans. The decrease in people served by UnitedHealthcare Global is a result of increased unemployment and underwriting discipline.UnitedHealthcare’s revenue increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs and the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through the commercial and Global businesses and foreign currency impacts. In 2020, earnings from operations increased due to the deferral of care caused by COVID-19 on the health system and the factors impacting revenue, partially offset by the return of the Health Insurance Industry Tax, COVID-19 care and testing costs, customer assistance programs and broader economic effects. OptumTotal revenues increased as each segment reported revenue growth. Earnings from operations increased due to growth at OptumHealth and OptumInsight.The results by segment were as follows:OptumHealthRevenue and earnings at OptumHealth increased primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions in risk-based care delivery. Reduced care volumes in fee-for-service arrangements as a result of COVID-19 partially offset the increases in revenues and earnings. OptumHealth served approximately 98 million people as of December 31, 2020 compared to 96 million people as of December 31, 2019.OptumInsightRevenue and earnings from operations at OptumInsight increased primarily due to growth in technology and managed services, partially offset by decreased activity levels in volume-based services due to the impact of COVID-19 on payer and care provider clients. OptumRxRevenue at OptumRx and the corresponding eliminations increased due to the inclusion of retail pharmacy co-payments. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements"" for further detail. Revenue at OptumRx also increased due to organic and acquisition growth in pharmacy care services, including specialty pharmacy, and new client wins, partially offset by an expected large client transition and lower script volumes driven by COVID-19 related care deferral and fewer people served due to economic-driven employment attrition. Earnings from operations remained relatively flat as COVID-19 impacts were partially offset by the factors impacting revenue and improved 30Table of Contentssupply chain management. OptumRx fulfilled 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in both 2020 and 2019 with growth offset by the large client transition. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimal levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdiction, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.3 billion and $5.6 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions)2020201920182020 vs. 2019Sources of cash:Cash provided by operating activities$22,174 $18,463 $15,713 $3,711 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments2,586 3,994 4,134 (1,408)Proceeds from common share issuances1,440 1,037 838 403 Customer funds administered1,677 13 — 1,664 Other— 219 — (219)Total sources of cash27,877 23,726 20,685 Uses of cash:Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed(7,139)(8,343)(5,997)1,204 Cash dividends paid(4,584)(3,932)(3,320)(652)Common share repurchases(4,250)(5,500)(4,500)1,250 Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software(2,051)(2,071)(2,063)20 Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (2,836)(2,504)(4,099)(332)Other(965)(1,237)(1,743)272 Total uses of cash(21,825)(23,587)(21,722)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(116)(20)(78)(96)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$5,936 $119 $(1,115)$5,817 2020 Cash Flows Compared to 2019 Cash FlowsIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher net earnings as well as changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in customer funds administered and net purchases of investments, and decreases in net issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, cash paid for acquisitions and share repurchases.31Table of ContentsFinancial ConditionAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $59.0 billion included $16.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.3 billion was available for general corporate use), $39.8 billion of debt securities and $2.3 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.7 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2020. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityCash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, commercial paper and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:•Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail of our commercial paper and long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.•Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.•Purchase and other obligations. These include $5.3 billion, $2.0 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.•Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.•Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements” for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2020, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements.”32Table of ContentsCredit Ratings.

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2020, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 58 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Dividends. In June 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.00 compared to $4.32 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2019. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.”Pending Acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, which are expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2021, we entered into agreements to purchase multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG). This acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to Change Healthcare shareholders’ approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $13 billion.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements” for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements which affect us.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2020, our days outstanding in medical payables was 48 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2020, 2019 and 2018 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $880 million, $580 million and $320 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying 33Table of Contentsobserved medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. Our judgments also consider the impacts of COVID-19 on these factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2020: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)(0.75)%$600 (0.50)399 (0.25)199 0.25(198)0.50(395)0.75(591)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, which included consideration of COVID-19 in 2020. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2020: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)3%$793 2529 1264 (1)(264)(2)(529)(3)(793)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2020; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2020 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2020 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $157 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” 34Table of ContentsGoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors, cost factors, changes in overall financial performance, and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates, cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact. The market-based method requires determination of appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market. The peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value. As of October 1, 2020, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.As of December 31, 2020, we had $20 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2020, $8 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, $37 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $45 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.35Table of ContentsWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.The following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):December 31, 2020Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2%$401 $163 $(3,020)$(8,700)1201 82 (1,499)(4,744)(1)(75)(12)820 5,266 (2)(75)(12)886 8,101 December 31, 2019Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2%$282 $185 $(2,668)$(6,813)1141 93 (1,331)(3,704)(1)(141)(93)1,246 4,433 (2)(282)(185)2,071 9,613 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $535 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.3 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 36Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:28:57.936251

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Discussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW GeneralUnitedHealth Group is a diversified health care company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare:•Optum Health;•Optum Insight;•Optum Rx; and•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, UnitedHealthcare Community & State and UnitedHealthcare Global.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, such as the economic impact of COVID-19, and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefit products, we start with our view of expected future costs, including any potential impacts from COVID-19. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum MLR thresholds. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all of these dimensions. The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” We expect Medicaid revenue growth due to anticipated changes in mix and pricing trends; we also believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.25Table of ContentsMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, health system utilization and prescription drug costs. COVID-19 related care costs as well as the deferral of care have impacted medical cost trends in 2021 and may continue to do so in 2022 and subsequent years. Future medical cost trends may be impacted by increased consumer demand for care, potentially even higher acuity care, due to the temporary deferral of care since the onset of the pandemic. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. The continued uncertain impact of COVID-19 may impact our ability to estimate medical costs payable, which has resulted in, and could continue to result in, increased variability to medical cost reserve development.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in plans with underlying performance-based care provider payment models rewarding high-quality, affordable care and foster collaboration. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes for patients.This trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Final 2022 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an increase in industry base rates of approximately 4.1%, short of the industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. The ongoing Medicare Advantage funding pressure places continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative efficiency. There are a number of adjustments we have made to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions. In some years, these adjustments impact the majority of the seniors we serve through Medicare Advantage. For example, we seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust members' benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.Our Medicare Advantage rates are currently enhanced by CMS quality bonuses in certain counties based on our local plans’ Star ratings. The level of Star ratings from CMS, based upon specified clinical and operational performance standards, will impact future quality bonuses. ACA Tax (Health Insurance Tax). The Health Insurance Tax was permanently repealed by Congress, effective January 1, 2021. The permanent repeal of the tax impacts year-over-year comparability of our financial statements, including revenues, operating costs, medical care ratio (MCR), operating cost ratio, effective tax rate and cash flows from operations.COVID-19 Trends and UncertaintiesThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows remains uncertain. In 2021, overall care activity continued to increase, including a mix of temporary deferral of care activity and COVID-19 related care costs. The temporary deferral of care was more than offset by COVID-19 related care and testing costs, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts and general economic impacts. In future periods, care patterns may moderately exceed normal baselines as previously deferred care is obtained and acuity temporarily rises due to missed regular care. From time to time, health system capacity may be subject to possible increased volatility due to the pandemic. Specific trends and uncertainties related to our two business platforms are as follows:Optum. COVID-19 related care costs continued to impact our Optum Health value-based care delivery businesses, which were partially offset by the continued temporary deferral of care. The temporary deferral of care reduced fee-for-service care delivery volume, as well as Optum Insight and Optum Rx volume-based business activity, although we expect the impact to continue decreasing as care returns to, and potentially exceeds, normal levels. We believe COVID-19 will continue to influence customer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how and where care is delivered and the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. As a result of the dynamic situation and broad-reaching impact to the health system, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our Optum businesses is uncertain.26Table of ContentsUnitedHealthcare. In 2021, we continued expanded benefit coverage in areas such as COVID-19 related care and testing, telemedicine, and pharmacy; we also continued to assist our customers, care providers, members and communities in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. UnitedHealthcare’s 2021 results of operations were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related care and testing, rebate requirements and other revenue impacts, as well as broader economic impacts, partially offset by the continued deferral of care. The increase in people served through Medicaid was attributable in part to continuing action by states to ease eligibility redetermination requirements due to the COVID-19 public health emergency.Disrupted care patterns, as a result of the pandemic, have affected and may continue to temporarily affect the ability to obtain complete member health status information, impacting revenue in businesses utilizing risk adjustment methodologies. The ultimate overall impact is uncertain and dependent on the future pacing, intensity and duration of the pandemic, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccination and treatments and general economic uncertainty.SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMSThe following represents a summary of select 2021 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2020.•Consolidated revenues increased by 12%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 11% and Optum revenues grew 14%. •UnitedHealthcare served 2.1 million more people domestically, primarily driven by growth in community and senior programs.•Earnings from operations increased by 7%, including an increase of 19% at Optum, partially offset by a decrease of 3% at UnitedHealthcare.•Diluted earnings per common share increased 13% to $18.08. •Cash flows from operations were $22.3 billion.•Return on equity was 25.2%.27Table of ContentsRESULTS SUMMARYThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)For the Years Ended December 31,Change2021202020192021 vs. 2020Revenues:Premiums$226,233 $201,478 $189,699 $24,755 12 %Products34,437 34,145 31,597 292 1 Services24,603 20,016 18,973 4,587 23 Investment and other income2,324 1,502 1,886 822 55 Total revenues287,597 257,141 242,155 30,456 12 Operating costs:Medical costs186,911 159,396 156,440 27,515 17 Operating costs42,579 41,704 35,193 875 2 Cost of products sold31,034 30,745 28,117 289 1 Depreciation and amortization3,103 2,891 2,720 212 7 Total operating costs263,627 234,736 222,470 28,891 12 Earnings from operations23,970 22,405 19,685 1,565 7 Interest expense(1,660)(1,663)(1,704)3 — Earnings before income taxes22,310 20,742 17,981 1,568 8 Provision for income taxes(4,578)(4,973)(3,742)395 (8)Net earnings17,732 15,769 14,239 1,963 12 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(447)(366)(400)(81)22 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$17,285 $15,403 $13,839 $1,882 12 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$18.08 $16.03 $14.33 $2.05 13 %Medical care ratio (a)82.6 %79.1 %82.5 %3.5 %Operating cost ratio14.8 16.2 14.5 (1.4)Operating margin8.3 8.7 8.1 (0.4)Tax rate20.5 24.0 20.8 (3.5)Net earnings margin (b)6.0 6.0 5.7 — Return on equity (c)25.2 %24.9 %25.7 %0.3 %________ (a)Medical care ratio is calculated as medical costs divided by premium revenue.(b)Net earnings margin attributable to UnitedHealth Group shareholders.(c)Return on equity is calculated as net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders divided by average shareholders’ equity.

Medical Costs and MCRMedical costs increased as a result of growth in people served through Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and commercial offerings, as well as increased COVID-19 related care costs and medical cost trends, partially offset by higher temporary care deferrals. The MCR increased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, partially offset by increased temporary care deferrals. Medical costs and the MCR were also impacted by increased prior year favorable reserve development.28Table of ContentsOperating Cost RatioThe operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax, COVID-19 impacts on revenue and operating costs in the prior year and operating efficiency gains, partially offset by business mix.Income Tax RateOur effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the permanent repeal of the nondeductible Health Insurance Tax.Reportable SegmentsSee Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the mix of care delivered through accountable care models at Optum Health, customer penetration and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions, except percentages)2021202020192021 vs. 2020RevenuesUnitedHealthcare$222,899 $200,875 $193,842 $22,024 11 %Optum Health54,065 39,808 30,317 14,257 36 Optum Insight12,199 10,802 10,006 1,397 13 Optum Rx91,314 87,498 74,288 3,816 4 Optum eliminations(2,013)(1,800)(1,661)(213)12 Optum155,565 136,308 112,950 19,257 14 Eliminations(90,867)(80,042)(64,637)(10,825)14 Consolidated revenues$287,597 $257,141 $242,155 $30,456 12 %Earnings from operationsUnitedHealthcare$11,975 $12,359 $10,326 $(384)(3)%Optum Health4,462 3,434 2,963 1,028 30 Optum Insight3,398 2,725 2,494 673 25 Optum Rx4,135 3,887 3,902 248 6 Optum11,995 10,046 9,359 1,949 19 Consolidated earnings from operations$23,970 $22,405 $19,685 $1,565 7 %Operating marginUnitedHealthcare5.4 %6.2 %5.3 %(0.8)%Optum Health8.3 8.6 9.8 (0.3)Optum Insight27.9 25.2 24.9 2.7 Optum Rx4.5 4.4 5.3 0.1 Optum7.7 7.4 8.3 0.3 Consolidated operating margin8.3 %8.7 %8.1 %(0.4)%UnitedHealthcareThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions, except percentages)2021202020192021 vs. 2020UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual$60,023 $55,872 $56,945 $4,151 7 %UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement100,552 90,764 83,252 9,788 11 UnitedHealthcare Community & State53,979 46,487 43,790 7,492 16 UnitedHealthcare Global8,345 7,752 9,855 593 8 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues$222,899 $200,875 $193,842 $22,024 11 %29Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: December 31,Change(in thousands, except percentages)2021202020192021 vs. 2020Commercial:Risk-based7,985 7,910 8,575 75 1 %Fee-based18,595 18,310 19,185 285 2 Total commercial26,580 26,220 27,760 360 1 Medicare Advantage6,490 5,710 5,270 780 14 Medicaid7,655 6,620 5,900 1,035 16 Medicare Supplement (Standardized)4,395 4,460 4,500 (65)(1)Total community and senior18,540 16,790 15,670 1,750 10 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical45,120 43,010 43,430 2,110 5 Global5,510 5,425 5,720 85 2 Total UnitedHealthcare - medical50,630 48,435 49,150 2,195 5 %Supplemental Data:Medicare Part D stand-alone3,700 4,045 4,405 (345)(9)%Commercial business increased primarily due to acquisitions in risk-based and fee-based offerings and organic growth in innovative products. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses. OptumTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:Optum HealthRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2021 compared to 98 million people as of December 31, 2020.Optum InsightRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, including expanding relationships serving health systems. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.Optum RxRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines.30Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions)2021202020192021 vs. 2020Sources of cash:Cash provided by operating activities$22,343 $22,174 $18,463 $169 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments2,481 2,586 3,994 (105)Proceeds from common share issuances1,355 1,440 1,037 (85)Customer funds administered622 1,677 13 (1,055)Other— — 219 — Total sources of cash26,801 27,877 23,726 Uses of cash:Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed(4,821)(7,139)(8,343)2,318 Cash dividends paid(5,280)(4,584)(3,932)(696)Common share repurchases(5,000)(4,250)(5,500)(750)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software(2,454)(2,051)(2,071)(403)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,843)(2,836)(2,504)993 Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests(1,338)— (618)(1,338)Other(1,549)(965)(619)(584)Total uses of cash(22,285)(21,825)(23,587)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(62)(116)(20)54 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$4,454 $5,936 $119 $(1,482)2021 Cash Flows Compared to 2020 Cash FlowsCash flows provided by operating activities were largely consistent, with higher net earnings being offset by changes in working capital accounts. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included decreased customer funds administered and increased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, share repurchases and cash dividends paid, partially offset by decreased cash paid for acquisitions and net purchases of investments.31Table of ContentsFinancial ConditionAs of December 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $65.1 billion included $21.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $2.8 billion was available for general corporate use), $40.2 billion of debt securities and $3.5 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 3.9 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2021. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityCash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:•Debt Obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.•Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.•Purchase and other obligations. These include $4.7 billion, $2.7 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.•Other Liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.•Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail. We do not have any material required redemptions in the next twelve months.We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2021, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 36%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as, to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”32Table of ContentsCredit Ratings.

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2021, we had Board authorization to purchase up to 45 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.and Supplementary Data.”Dividends. In June 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $5.80 compared to $5.00 per share, which the Company had paid since June 2020. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements.and Supplementary Data.”Pending Acquisitions. In 2021, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, most notably, Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: CHNG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Additionally, in January 2022, we entered into agreements to acquire multiple companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $12 billion.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, our days outstanding in medical payables was 47 days, calculated as total medical payables divided by total medical costs times the number of days in the period. In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion, $880 million and $580 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service 33Table of Contentsto claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. Our judgments also consider the impacts of COVID-19 on these factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions) or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2021: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)(0.75)%$686 (0.50)456 (0.25)228 0.25(226)0.50(452)0.75(676)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators, which included consideration of COVID-19. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics, such as COVID-19. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2021: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)3%$895 2597 1298 (1)(298)(2)(597)(3)(895)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2021; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2021 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2021 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $184 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost 34Table of Contentsfactors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates, cash flow projections and peer company multiples to analyze the potential for a material impact. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate peer group whose securities are traded on an active market. The peer group is used to derive market multiples to estimate fair value. As of October 1, 2021, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values. LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2021, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.As of December 31, 2021, we had $25 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2021, $7 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, $37 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $45 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.35Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):December 31, 2021Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2 %$499 $133 $(3,080)$(8,664)1250 67 (1,564)(4,723)(1)(85)(7)1,398 5,655 (2)(85)(7)1,857 10,892 December 31, 2020Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2%$401 $163 $(3,020)$(8,700)1201 82 (1,499)(4,744)(1)(75)(12)820 5,266 (2)(75)(12)886 8,101 Note: Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating-rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 100 and 200 basis point reduction in interest income or interest expense, as the rates are assumed not to fall below zero. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, some of our investments had interest rates below 2% so the assumed hypothetical change in the fair value of investments does not reflect the full 200 basis point reduction.We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Global’s operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and UnitedHealthcare Global’s assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $520 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.5 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 36Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:28:56.017363

Our two complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are driven by this unified mission and vision to improve health care access, affordability, experiences and outcomes for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.We have four reportable segments across our two business platforms, Optum and UnitedHealthcare:•Optum Health;•Optum Insight;•Optum Rx; and•UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State.Further information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Business TrendsOur businesses participate in the United States, South America and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties.” In Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.23Table of ContentsMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs; care activity; and prescription drug costs. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.Medicaid Redeterminations. In December 2022, Congress passed the 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill that allows states to resume Medicaid redeterminations beginning in April 2023. Redeterminations will result in a decline in people served through our Medicaid business and an expected increase in people served through our commercial and exchange-based offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people have continued access to benefits.Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration.This trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. Regulatory Trends and UncertaintiesFollowing is a summary of management’s view of the trends and uncertainties related to regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the February 2023 Advance Notice for 2024 rates would result in an industry base rate decrease, well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, proposed substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, would result in reduced funding and benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges. As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.

The MCR decreased due to COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development and business mix.Operating Cost RatioThe operating cost ratio decreased primarily due to productivity gains, partially offset by investments and business mix.25Table of ContentsReportable SegmentsSee Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” for more information on our segments. We utilize various metrics to evaluate and manage our reportable segments, including individuals served by UnitedHealthcare by major market segment and funding arrangement, people served by Optum Health and adjusted scripts for Optum Rx. These metrics are the main drivers of revenue, earnings and cash flows at each business. The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions, except percentages)2022202120202022 vs. 2021RevenuesUnitedHealthcare$249,741 $222,899 $200,875 $26,842 12 %Optum Health71,174 54,065 39,808 17,109 32 Optum Insight14,581 12,199 10,802 2,382 20 Optum Rx99,773 91,314 87,498 8,459 9 Optum eliminations(2,760)(2,013)(1,800)(747)37 Optum182,768 155,565 136,308 27,203 17 Eliminations(108,347)(90,867)(80,042)(17,480)19 Consolidated revenues$324,162 $287,597 $257,141 $36,565 13 %Earnings from operationsUnitedHealthcare$14,379 $11,975 $12,359 $2,404 20 %Optum Health6,032 4,462 3,434 1,570 35 Optum Insight3,588 3,398 2,725 190 6 Optum Rx4,436 4,135 3,887 301 7 Optum14,056 11,995 10,046 2,061 17 Consolidated earnings from operations$28,435 $23,970 $22,405 $4,465 19 %Operating marginUnitedHealthcare5.8 %5.4 %6.2 %0.4 %Optum Health8.5 8.3 8.6 0.2 Optum Insight24.6 27.9 25.2 (3.3)Optum Rx4.4 4.5 4.4 (0.1)Optum7.7 7.7 7.4 — Consolidated operating margin8.8 %8.3 %8.7 %0.5 %UnitedHealthcareThe following table summarizes UnitedHealthcare revenues by business: For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions, except percentages)2022202120202022 vs. 2021UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Domestic$63,599 $60,023 $55,872 $3,576 6 %UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Global (a)8,668 8,345 7,752 323 4 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual - Total (a)72,267 68,368 63,624 3,899 6 UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement113,671 100,552 90,764 13,119 13 UnitedHealthcare Community & State63,803 53,979 46,487 9,824 18 Total UnitedHealthcare revenues$249,741 $222,899 $200,875 $26,842 12 %(a) On January 1, 2022, we realigned our operating segments to combine UnitedHealthcare Global and UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual.26Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the number of individuals served by our UnitedHealthcare businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement: December 31,Change(in thousands, except percentages)2022202120202022 vs. 2021Commercial - domestic:Risk-based8,045 7,985 7,910 60 1 %Fee-based18,640 18,595 18,310 45 — Total commercial - domestic26,685 26,580 26,220 105 — Medicare Advantage7,105 6,490 5,710 615 9 Medicaid8,170 7,655 6,620 515 7 Medicare Supplement (Standardized)4,375 4,395 4,460 (20)— Total community and senior19,650 18,540 16,790 1,110 6 Total UnitedHealthcare - domestic medical46,335 45,120 43,010 1,215 3 Commercial - global5,360 5,510 5,425 (150)(3)Total UnitedHealthcare - medical51,695 50,630 48,435 1,065 2 %Supplemental Data:Medicare Part D stand-alone3,295 3,700 4,045 (405)(11)%Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.UnitedHealthcare’s revenues increased due to growth in the number of people served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Earnings from operations increased due to growth in people served and COVID-19 effects, partially offset by decreased prior years favorable development.OptumTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:Optum HealthRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in patients served under value-based care arrangements and business combinations. Earnings from operations increased due to organic growth in the number of people served under value-based care arrangements, cost management initiatives, asset dispositions and COVID-19 effects. Optum Health served approximately 102 million people as of December 31, 2022 compared to 100 million people as of December 31, 2021.Optum InsightRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, with managed services revenue growth driven by business combinations and new health system partnerships.Optum RxRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services, including community health, specialty and home delivery pharmacies. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1,438 million and 1,368 million adjusted scripts in 2022 and 2021, respectively.27Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCESLiquidityIntroductionWe manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.8 billion and $8.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions)2022202120202022 vs. 2021Sources of cash:Cash provided by operating activities$26,206 $22,343 $22,174 $3,863 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments12,536 2,481 2,586 10,055 Proceeds from common share issuances1,253 1,355 1,440 (102)Customer funds administered5,548 622 1,677 4,926 Cash received for dispositions3,414 15 221 3,399 Total sources of cash48,957 26,816 28,098 Uses of cash:Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed(21,458)(4,821)(7,139)(16,637)Cash dividends paid(5,991)(5,280)(4,584)(711)Common share repurchases(7,000)(5,000)(4,250)(2,000)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software(2,802)(2,454)(2,051)(348)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (6,837)(1,843)(2,836)(4,994)Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests(176)(1,338)— 1,162 Other(2,737)(1,564)(1,186)(1,173)Total uses of cash(47,001)(22,300)(22,046)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents34 (62)(116)96 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$1,990 $4,454 $5,936 $(2,464)2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021 Cash FlowsIncreased cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by changes in working capital accounts and increased net earnings. Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included increased net issuances of long-term debt, customer funds administered, primarily driven by Medicare Part D timing and increased HSA deposits, cash received for dispositions and decreased purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests, partially offset by increased cash paid for acquisitions, net purchases of investments and common stock repurchases.28Table of ContentsFinancial ConditionAs of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of $69.4 billion included $23.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.3 billion was available for general corporate use), $42.3 billion of debt securities and $3.7 billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our fair value measurements.Our available-for-sale debt portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.0 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of December 31, 2022. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.Capital Resources and Uses of LiquidityCash Requirements. The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable. Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:•Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. Interest coupon payments are typically paid semi-annually.•Operating leases. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.•Purchase and other obligations. These include $5.6 billion, $2.9 billion of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, of fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty, and remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. These amounts exclude agreements cancelable without penalty and liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022.•Other liabilities. These include other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022, including obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, unrecognized tax benefits and various long-term liabilities, which have some inherent uncertainty in the timing of these payments.•Redeemable noncontrolling interests. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail. We do not have any material expected redemptions in the next twelve months.We expect the cash required to meet our long-term obligations to be primarily generated through future cash flows from operations. However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of December 31, 2022, our debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38%.Long-Term Debt. Periodically, we access capital markets to issue long-term debt for general corporate purposes, such as to meet our working capital requirements, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. For more information on our debt, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”29Table of ContentsCredit Ratings.

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 31 million shares of our common stock. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Dividends. In June 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $6.60 compared to $5.80 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”Pending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, most notably, LHC Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LHCG), subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $9 billion. We completed the acquisition of LHC Group, Inc. on February 22, 2023.We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs PayableMedical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service.In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2022, 2021 and 2020 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $410 million, $1.7 billion and $880 million, respectively.In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.30Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2022: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)(0.75)%$765 (0.50)508 (0.25)254 0.25(252)0.50(503)0.75(753)Medical Cost Per Member Per Month Trend Factors. Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2022: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)3%$985 2656 1328 (1)(328)(2)(656)(3)(985)The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2022 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2022 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $215 million. For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.31Table of ContentsWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2022, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.LEGAL MATTERSA description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISKInvestments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.As of December 31, 2022, we had $31 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2022, $16 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.The fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, $38 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $43 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt.We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.32Table of ContentsThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):December 31, 2022Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2 %$629 $327 $(3,390)$(7,365)1314 164 (1,746)(4,002)(1)(314)(135)1,838 4,808 (2)(629)(266)3,746 10,641 December 31, 2021Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest RateInvestmentIncome PerAnnumInterestExpense PerAnnumFair Value ofFinancial AssetsFair Value ofFinancial Liabilities 2%$499 $133 $(3,080)$(8,664)1250 67 (1,564)(4,723)(1)(85)(7)1,398 5,655 (2)(85)(7)1,857 10,892 Note: The impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates may not reflect the full 100 or 200 basis point change on interest income and interest expense or on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as the rates are assumed to not fall below zero.We have an exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and the Chilean peso, to the U.S. dollar in translation of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s international business operating results at the average exchange rate over the accounting period, and assets and liabilities at the exchange rate at the end of the accounting period. The gains or losses resulting from translating foreign assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in equity and comprehensive income. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Brazilian real or Chilean peso reduces the carrying value of the net assets denominated in those currencies. For example, as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 10% and 25% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against those currencies would have caused a reduction in net assets of approximately $560 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We manage exposure to foreign currency earnings risk primarily by conducting our international business operations in their functional currencies.As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.7 billion of investments in equity securities, primarily consisting of investments in employee savings plan related investments, other venture investments and non-U.S. dollar fixed-income funds. Valuations in non-U.S. dollar funds are subject to foreign exchange rates. 33Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:28:53.670209

731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, serving approximately 55 million Americans. Our focus is on improving the American health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery; promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care; and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care providers, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and informatics; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. We provide individuals with access to quality, cost-effective health care services and resources. We promote the delivery of care, consistent with the best available evidence for effective health care. We provide employers with superb value, service and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline. 2004 Financial Performance Highlights UnitedHealth Group had an excellent year in 2004. The company achieved diversified growth across its business segments and generated net earnings of $2.6 billion and operating cash flows of $4.1 billion, representing increases of 42% and 38%, respectively, over 2003. Other financial performance highlights include: • Diluted net earnings per common share of $3.94, representing an increase of 33% over 2003. • Revenues of $37.2 billion, a 29% increase over 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased 8% over 2003. • Operating earnings of more than $4.1 billion, up 40% over 2003. • Consolidated operating margin of 11.0%, up from 10.2% in 2003, driven primarily by improved margins on risk-based products, revenue mix changes and operational and productivity improvements. • Return on shareholders’ equity of 31.4%. UnitedHealth Group acquired Oxford Health Plans, Inc. (Oxford) in July 2004 for total consideration of approximately $5.0 billion and acquired Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. (MAMSI) in February 2004 for total consideration of approximately $2.7 billion. The results of operations and financial condition of Oxford and MAMSI have been included in UnitedHealth Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the respective acquisition dates. 2004 Results Compared to 2003 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues are comprised of premium revenues from risk-based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both premium risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. 17 Table of Contents Consolidated revenues increased by $8.4 billion, or 29%, in 2004 to $37.2 billion, primarily as a result of revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004 as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2004 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues in 2004 totaled $33.5 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 32%, over 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, premium revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004. This increase was due in part to average net premium rate increases of approximately 9% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based business, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products and changes in the commercial product benefit and customer mix. In addition, Ovations’ premium revenues increased largely due to increases in the number of individuals it serves through Medicare Advantage products and changes in product mix related to Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on all of these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs and Specialized Care Services’ businesses also increased due to advances in the number of individuals served by those businesses. Service Revenues Service revenues in 2004 totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $217 million, or 7%, over 2003. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased due to new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $388 million, representing an increase of $131 million over 2003. Interest income increased by $134 million in 2004, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year from the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule Financial Corporation (Golden Rule), which was acquired in November 2003. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $19 million in 2004, a decrease of $3 million from 2003. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 81.4% in 2003 to 80.6% in 2004. Excluding the AARP business1, the medical care ratio decreased 50 basis points from 80.0% in 2003 to 79.5% in 2004. The medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product, business and customer mix. Each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2003 include approximately $150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. 1 Management believes disclosure of the medical care ratio excluding the AARP business is meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through a rate stabilization fund (RSF). Although the company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits to date, and management believes the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract during the foreseeable future. 18 Table of Contents On an absolute dollar basis, 2004 medical costs increased $6.3 billion, or 30%, over 2003 principally due to the impact of the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 8% driven primarily by medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2004 was 15.4%, down from 16.9% in 2003. This decrease was driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. The existence of premium revenues within our risk-based products cause them to have lower operating cost ratios than fee-based products, which have no premium revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2004 increased $868 million, or 18%, over 2003 primarily due to the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 3%. This increase was driven by a more than 3% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise in 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2004 was $374 million, an increase of $75 million, or 25%, over 2003. Approximately $42 million of this increase is related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in 2004. The remaining increase of $33 million is due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.9% in 2004, compared to 35.7% in 2003. The decrease was driven mainly by favorable settlements of prior year income tax returns. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2004 2003 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 32,673 $ 24,807 32 % Uniprise 3,365 3,107 8 % Specialized Care Services 2,295 1,878 22 % Ingenix 670 574 17 % Corporate and Eliminations (1,785 ) (1,543 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 37,218 $ 28,823 29 % Earnings From Operations 2004 2003 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 2,810 $ 1,865 51 % Uniprise 677 610 11 % Specialized Care Services 485 385 26 % Ingenix 129 75 72 % Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 4,101 $ 2,935 40 % nm - not meaningful 19 Table of Contents Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment consists of the UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. UnitedHealthcare coordinates network-based health and well-being services on behalf of multistate, mid-sized and local employers and consumers. Ovations delivers health and well-being services to Americans over the age of 50, including the administration of supplemental health insurance coverage on behalf of AARP. AmeriChoice facilitates and manages health care services for state-sponsored Medicaid programs and their beneficiaries. Health Care Services had revenues of $32.7 billion in 2004, representing an increase of $7.9 billion, or 32%, over 2003, driven primarily by acquisitions since the beginning of 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $1.9 billion, or 8%, over 2003. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $850 million of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 9% on renewing commercial risk-based business and growth in the number of individuals served by fee-based products, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products. Ovations contributed approximately $770 million to the revenue advance over 2003 driven by growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products and changes in product mix related to Medicare supplement products it provides to AARP members, as well as rate increases on all of these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs and Medicaid premium rate increases. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2004 were $2.8 billion, representing an increase of $945 million, or 51%, over 2003. This increase primarily resulted from Ovations’ and UnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth, improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products and the impact of the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. UnitedHealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio improved to 79.0% in 2004 from 80.0% in 2003. The decrease in the commercial medical care ratio was primarily driven by net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ 2004 operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 110 basis points over 2003. This increase was principally driven by a combination of the improved commercial medical care ratio and changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 311: (in thousands) 2004 2003 Commercial Risk-based 7,655 5,400 Fee-based 3,305 2,895 Total Commercial 10,960 8,295 Medicare 330 230 Medicaid 1,260 1,105 Total Health Care Services 12,550 9,630 1 Excludes individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business as of December 31, 2004, increased by nearly 2.7 million, or 32%, over the prior year. Excluding the 2004 acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and a smaller regional health plan, the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business increased by 245,000. This included an increase of 285,000 in the number of individuals served with fee-based products, driven by new customer relationships and existing customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products, partially offset by a decrease of 40,000 in the number of individuals served with risk-based 20 Table of Contents products resulting primarily from customers converting to self-funded, fee-based arrangements and a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment. Excluding the impact of the Oxford acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products increased by 30,000, or 13%, from 2003. AmeriChoice’s Medicaid enrollment increased by 155,000, or 14%, due to organic growth in the number of individuals served and the acquisition of a Medicaid health plan in Michigan in February 2004, resulting in the addition of approximately 95,000 individuals served. Uniprise Uniprise provides network-based health and well-being services, business-to-business transaction processing services, consumer connectivity and technology support services to large employers and health plans, and provides health-related consumer and financial transaction products and services. Uniprise revenues in 2004 were $3.4 billion, representing an increase of 8% over 2003. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of the acquisition of Definity Health Corporation (Definity) in December 2004, and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers. Uniprise served 9.9 million individuals and 9.1 million individuals as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2004 were $677 million, representing an increase of 11% over 2003. Operating margin for 2004 improved to 20.1% from 19.6% in 2003. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprise’s infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services is a portfolio of specialty health and wellness companies, each serving a specialized market need with a unique offering of benefits, networks, services and resources. Specialized Care Services revenues during 2004 of $2.3 billion increased by $417 million, or 22%, over 2003. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by United Behavioral Health, its behavioral health benefits business, Dental Benefit Providers, its dental services business, and Spectera, its vision care benefits business; rate increases related to these businesses; and incremental revenues related to businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 of approximately $100 million. Earnings from operations in 2004 of $485 million increased $100 million, or 26%, over 2003. Specialized Care Services’ operating margin increased to 21.1% in 2004, up from 20.5% in 2003. This increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity improvements within Specialized Care Services’ businesses and consolidation of the production and service operation infrastructure to enhance productivity and efficiency and to improve the quality and consistency of service, partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix is a leader in the field of health care data analysis and application, serving pharmaceutical companies, health insurers and other payers, physicians and other health care providers, large employers, and governments. Ingenix revenues in 2004 of $670 million increased by $96 million, or 17%, over 2003. This was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses. Earnings from operations in 2004 were $129 million, up $54 million, or 72%, from 2003. Operating margin was 19.3% in 2004, up from 13.1% in 2003. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth and improving gross margins in the health information and clinical research businesses. 21 Table of Contents 2003 Results Compared to 2002 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues increased by $3.8 billion, or 15%, in 2003 to $28.8 billion. Consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11% as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth across business segments, and 4% as a result of revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2002. Following is a discussion of 2003 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues in 2003 totaled $25.4 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion, or 16%, over 2002. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by $1.8 billion, driven primarily by average premium rate increases of 12% to 13% on renewing commercial risk-based business. Premium revenues from Medicaid programs also increased by approximately $1.0 billion over 2002. Approximately 70% of this increase resulted from the acquisition of AmeriChoice on September 30, 2002, with the remaining 30% driven by growth in the number of individuals served by our AmeriChoice Medicaid programs since the acquisition date. The remaining premium revenue growth in 2003 was primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members and its Evercare business, along with growth in several of Specialized Care Services’ businesses. Service Revenues Service revenues in 2003 totaled $3.1 billion, an increase of $224 million, or 8%, over 2002. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 7% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2003. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $257 million, representing an increase of $37 million over 2002, due primarily to increased capital gains on sales of investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $22 million in 2003, compared with net capital losses of $18 million in 2002. Interest income decreased by $3 million in 2003, driven by lower yields on investments, partially offset by the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 83.0% in 2002 to 81.4% in 2003. Excluding the AARP business, the medical care ratio decreased 140 basis points from 81.4% in 2002 to 80.0% in 2003. The medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product, business and customer mix. Each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2003 include approximately $150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2002 include approximately $70 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. On an absolute dollar basis, 2003 medical costs increased $2.5 billion, or 14%, over 2002. The increase was driven primarily by a rise in medical costs of approximately 10% to 11% due to medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption, and incremental medical costs related to businesses acquired since the beginning of 2002. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2003 was 16.9%, down from 17.5% in 2002. This decrease was driven primarily by revenue mix changes, with greater growth from premium revenues than from service revenues, and productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Our premium-based products have 22 Table of Contents lower operating cost ratios than our fee-based products. The impact of operating cost efficiencies in 2003 was partially offset by the continued incremental costs associated with the development, deployment, adoption and maintenance of new technology releases. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2003 increased $488 million, or 11%, over 2002. This increase was driven by a 6% increase in total individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2003, increases in broker commissions and premium taxes due to increased revenues, general operating cost inflation, and additional operating costs associated with change initiatives and acquired businesses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2003 was $299 million, an increase of $44 million over 2002. This increase was due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2002. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.7% in 2003, compared to 35.5% in 2002. The change from 2002 was due to changes in business and income mix among states with differing income tax rates.

The majority of the increase resulted from an increase of $1.9 billion in UnitedHealthcare revenues, an increase of 14% over 2002. The increase in UnitedHealthcare revenues was driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 12% to 13% on renewing commercial risk-based business and 8% growth in the number of individuals served by fee-based products during 2003. Revenues from Medicaid programs in 2003 increased by 23 Table of Contents $1.0 billion over 2002. Approximately 70% of this increase resulted from the acquisition of AmeriChoice on September 30, 2002, with the remaining 30% driven by growth in the number of individuals served by AmeriChoice Medicaid programs since the acquisition date. Ovations revenues increased by $319 million, or 5%, primarily due to increases in the number of individuals served by both its Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members and by its Evercare business. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2003 were nearly $1.9 billion, representing an increase of $537 million, or 40%, over 2002. This increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcare’s risk-based products, growth in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s fee-based products, and the acquisition of AmeriChoice on September 30, 2002. UnitedHealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio improved to 80.0% in 2003 from 81.8% in 2002. The decrease in the commercial medical care ratio was driven primarily by the decrease in net premium rate increases that exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ 2003 operating margin was 7.5%, an increase of 130 basis points over 2002. This increase was driven by a combination of improved medical care ratios and a shift in commercial product mix from risk-based products to higher-margin, fee-based products. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 311: (in thousands) 2003 2002 Commercial Risk-based 5,400 5,070 Fee-based 2,895 2,715 Total Commercial 8,295 7,785 Medicare 230 225 Medicaid 1,105 1,030 Total Health Care Services 9,630 9,040 1 Excludes individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business as of December 31, 2003, increased by 510,000, or 7%, over the prior year. This included an increase of 180,000, or 7%, in the number of individuals served with fee-based products, driven by new customer relationships and existing customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products. In addition, the number of individuals served by risk-based products increased by 330,000. This increase was driven by the acquisition of Golden Rule in November 2003, which resulted in the addition of 430,000 individuals served, partially offset by customers converting to self-funded, fee-based arrangements and UnitedHealthcare’s targeted withdrawal of risk-based offerings from unprofitable arrangements with customers using multiple benefit carriers. Ovations’ year-over-year Medicare Advantage enrollment remained relatively stable, with 230,000 individuals served as of December 31, 2003. Medicaid enrollment increased by 75,000, or 7%, due to strong growth in the number of individuals served by AmeriChoice over the past year. Uniprise Uniprise revenues in 2003 were $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 14% over 2002. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 6% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise during 2003, annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers, and a change in customer funding mix during 2002. Uniprise served 9.1 million individuals and 8.6 million individuals as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 24 Table of Contents Uniprise earnings from operations in 2003 were $610 million, representing an increase of 18% over 2002. Operating margin for 2003 improved to 19.6% from 19.0% in 2002. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services revenues during 2003 of $1.9 billion increased by $369 million, or 24%, over 2002. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by United Behavioral Health, its behavioral health benefits business; Dental Benefit Providers, its dental services business; and Spectera, its vision care benefits business; as well as rate increases related to these businesses. Earnings from operations in 2003 of $385 million increased $99 million, or 35%, over 2002. Specialized Care Services’ operating margin increased to 20.5% in 2003, up from 19.0% in 2002. This increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity improvements at United Behavioral Health. Ingenix Ingenix revenues in 2003 of $574 million increased by $83 million, or 17%, over 2002. This was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information business. Earnings from operations in 2003 were $75 million, up $20 million, or 36%, from 2002. Operating margin was 13.1% in 2003, up from 11.2% in 2002. The increase in the operating margin was primarily due to growth in the health information business. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2004 Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors’ approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long-term investments are also available for sale to meet short-term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long-term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, excluding depreciation and amortization. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative 25 Table of Contents impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs. In 2004, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $105 million. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. Cash and Investments Cash flows from operating activities were $4.1 billion in 2004, representing an increase over 2003 of $1.1 billion, or 38%. This increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of $871 million in net income excluding depreciation, amortization and other noncash items. Additionally, operating cash flows increased by $261 million due to cash generated by working capital changes, driven in part by improved cash collections leading to decreases in accounts receivable and increases in unearned premiums, and an increase in medical costs payable. As premium revenues and related medical costs increase, we generate incremental operating cash flows because we collect premium revenues in advance of the claim payments for related medical costs. We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with cash and investments of $12.3 billion at December 31, 2004. Total cash and investments increased by $2.8 billion since December 31, 2003, primarily due to $2.4 billion in cash and investments acquired in the Oxford and MAMSI acquisitions and strong operating cash flows, partially offset by common stock repurchases, cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. As further described under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2004, approximately $227 million of our $12.3 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries. Of this amount, approximately $37 million was segregated for future regulatory capital needs and the remainder was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Financing and Investing Activities In addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities, we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately $4.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 27.3% and 27.8% as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. We believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. On July 29, 2004, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Oxford. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Oxford shareholders received 0.6357 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $16.17 in cash for each share of Oxford common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $5.0 billion, comprised of approximately 52.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $3.4 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group’s share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of April 26, 2004), approximately $1.3 billion in cash and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of $240 million issued in exchange for Oxford’s outstanding vested common stock options. On February 10, 2004, our Health Care Services business segment acquired MAMSI. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, MAMSI shareholders received 0.82 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and 26 Table of Contents $18 in cash for each share of MAMSI common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $2.7 billion, comprised of 36.4 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at $1.9 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group’s share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of October 27, 2003) and approximately $800 million in cash. On December 10, 2004, our Uniprise business segment acquired Definity. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $305 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Definity. Available cash and commercial paper issuance financed the Definity purchase price. In July 2004, we issued $1.2 billion of commercial paper to fund the cash portion of the Oxford purchase price. In August 2004, we refinanced the commercial paper by issuing $550 million of 3.4% fixed-rate notes due August 2007, $450 million of 4.1% fixed-rate notes due August 2009 and $500 million of 5.0% fixed-rate notes due August 2014. In February 2004, we issued $250 million of 3.8% fixed-rate notes due February 2009 and $250 million of 4.8% fixed-rate notes due February 2014. We used the proceeds from the February 2004 borrowings to finance a majority of the cash portion of the MAMSI purchase price as described above. In December and March 2003, we issued $500 million of four-year, fixed-rate notes and $450 million of 10-year, fixed-rate notes with interest rates of 3.3% and 4.9%, respectively. We used the proceeds from the 2003 borrowings to repay commercial paper and maturing term debt, and for general corporate purposes including working capital, capital expenditures, business acquisitions and share repurchases. We entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert our interest exposure on a majority of these 2003 and 2004 borrowings from a fixed to a variable rate. The interest rate swap agreements on these borrowings have aggregate notional amounts of $2.9 billion. At December 31, 2004, the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 2.3% to 3.3%. The differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In June 2004, we executed a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility to support our commercial paper program. This credit facility replaced our existing $450 million revolving facility that was set to expire in July 2005, and our $450 million, 364-day facility that was set to expire in July 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility. Commercial paper increased from $79 million at December 31, 2003, to $273 million at December 31, 2004. Our debt arrangements and credit facility contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity) below 45% and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels. We are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants. Our senior debt is rated “A” by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch, and “A3” with a positive outlook by Moody’s. Our commercial paper is rated “A-1” by S&P, “F-1” by Fitch, and “P-2” with a positive outlook by Moody’s. Consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the “A” range, we intend to maintain our debt-to-total-capital ratio at approximately 30% or less. A significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Under our board of directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During 2004, we repurchased 51.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $68 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $3.5 billion. As of December 31, 2004, we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 54.6 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program 27 Table of Contents is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital. A decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility. Under our S-3 shelf registration statement (for common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities), the remaining issuing capacity of all covered securities is $500 million. We intend to file a new S-3 shelf registration statement during the first half of 2005 to increase our remaining issuing capacity. We may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering. Under our S-4 acquisition shelf registration statement, we have remaining issuing capacity of 24.3 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities. We filed separate S-4 registration statements for the 36.4 million shares issued in connection with the February 2004 acquisition of MAMSI and for the 52.2 million shares issued in connection with the July 2004 acquisition of Oxford described previously. Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2004, under our various contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments (in millions): 2005 2006 to 2007 2008 to 2009 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper1 $ 673 $ 950 $ 1,200 $ 1,200 $ 4,023 Operating Leases 126 222 140 149 637 Purchase Obligations2 103 69 12 — 184 Future Policy Benefits3 107 272 224 1,173 1,776 Other Long-Term Obligations4 — — 58 212 270 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,009 $ 1,513 $ 1,634 $ 2,734 $ 6,890 1 Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. 2 Minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services. 3 Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts. 4 Includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments. Currently, we do not have any other material contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. AARP In January 1998, we entered into a 10-year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare. Under the terms of the contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. Premium revenues from our portion of the AARP insurance offerings were approximately $4.5 billion in 2004, $4.1 billion in 2003 and $3.7 billion in 2002. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member services expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the 28 Table of Contents RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions We conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. The agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings. Consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the “A” range, we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. As of December 31, 2004, our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately $4.1 billion, which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care provider and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to 12 months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable 29 Table of Contents development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than one-half of 1% of annual medical costs, less than 4% of annual earnings from operations and less than 3% of medical costs payable. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations (in millions). FavorableDevelopment Net Impacton MedicalCosts(a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations As Reported As Adjusted(b) As Reported As Adjusted(b) 2001 $ 30 ($40 ) $ 17,644 $ 17,604 $ 1,566 $ 1,606 2002 $ 70 ($80 ) $ 18,192 $ 18,112 $ 2,186 $ 2,266 2003 $ 150 ($60 ) $ 20,714 $ 20,654 $ 2,935 $ 2,995 2004 $ 210 (c ) $ 27,000 (c ) $ 4,101 (c ) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2005 will change as our December 31, 2004 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2005. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of the company’s liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2004, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company’s liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2004; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2004 estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2004 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $46 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by approximately $0.05 per share. Long-Lived Assets As of December 31, 2004, we had long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, equipment and capitalized software, of $11.8 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of the respective assets and assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Investments As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $8.3 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2004, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $215 million and gross unrealized losses of $11 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary. New information and the 30 Table of Contents passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period, and record changes in the period they become known. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages, if any, for such matters. We do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. Inflation The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers. Through contracts with physicians and other health care providers, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Legal Matters Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design, management and offerings of our services. We record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the cost of business insurance coverage increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. 31 Table of Contents In Re: Managed Care Litigation: MDL No. 1334. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. In December 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of ERISA and RICO in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. The trial court granted the health care providers’ motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the class action status of the RICO claims, but reversed as to the breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. Through a series of motions and appeals, all direct claims against UnitedHealthcare have been compelled to arbitration. The trial court has denied UnitedHealthcare’s further motion to compel the secondary RICO claims to arbitration and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed that order. A trial date has been set for September 2005. The trial court has ordered that the trial be bifurcated into separate liability and damage proceedings. The American Medical Association et al. v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, United HealthCare Services. Inc. and UnitedHealth Group. On March 15, 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against the company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. On April 13, 2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA claims and the claims brought by the American Medical Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On May 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the American Medical Association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff. On May 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. On July 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to assert RICO violations. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described above, will, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The company’s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long-term debt. Approximately $12.0 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2004 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed-income investment portfolio at December 31, 2004, the fair value of our fixed-income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $355 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long-term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short-term 32 Table of Contents investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $3.2 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and $825 million had fixed rates as of December 31, 2004. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt. At December 31, 2004, we had $207 million of equity investments, primarily held by our UnitedHealth Capital business in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject UnitedHealth Group to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2004, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “seeks,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. This discussion is intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications. We must effectively manage our health care costs. Under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based products (excluding AARP) have typically comprised approximately 75% to 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our customers. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of 33 Table of Contents individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before contract commencement. Services are delivered and related costs are incurred when the contract commences. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period, inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. If medical costs increased by 1 percent without a proportional change in related revenues for UnitedHealthcare’s commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2004 would have been reduced by approximately $105 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which we have not received the underlying claims or for which we have received the claims but not yet processed them. If these estimates prove too high or too low, the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results. That change can be either positive or negative to our results. We face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care Services segments, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Humana Inc., PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., WellChoice, Inc., and WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises concentrated in more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized Care Services and Ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses. The addition of new competitors for at least the short-term can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. Our relationship with AARP is important Under our 10-year contract with AARP, which commenced in 1998, we provide Medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to AARP members. As of December 31, 2004, our portion of AARP’s insurance program represented approximately $4.5 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 3.8 million AARP members. The AARP contract may be terminated early by us or AARP under certain circumstances, including a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangement depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. The favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in Medicare are uncertain. The Medicare changes being implemented as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 are complex and wide-ranging. There are numerous changes that will influence our business. We have invested considerable resources analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with the changes that may arise. In January 2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released detailed regulations on major aspects of 34 Table of Contents the legislation, however, some important requirements related to the implementation of the new product offerings, including the Part D prescription drug benefit and the regional Medicare Advantage Preferred Provider Organizations, have not yet been released by the federal government, thus creating challenges for planning and implementation. We believe the increased funding provided in the legislation will increase the number of competitors in the seniors health services market. Our business is subject to government scrutiny, and we must respond quickly and appropriately to changes in government regulations. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to consummate our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in obtaining or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; and government-sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation, or, if enacted, what their terms will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. We typically have and are currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Department of Justice and U.S. attorneys. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. Important relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices. A number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws. In any particular market, these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. 35 Table of Contents The nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks, and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some of the costs associated with litigation. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design, management and offerings of our services. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims related to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits were filed against us and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. The suits are purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (“RICO”). In March 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. Although the expenses which we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits and the American Medical Association lawsuit have not been material to our business, we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters, even if they are without merit. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. We believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance; however, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. Our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. We use or employ independent third parties, such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), with whom we have entered into agreements, for significant portions of our data center operations. Even though we have appropriate provisions in our agreements, including provisions with respect to specific performance standards, covenants, warranties, audit rights, indemnification, and other provisions, our dependence on these third parties makes our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform adequately under the contracts, due to internal or external factors. Although there are a limited number of service organizations with the size, scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services, we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms. A change in service providers, however, could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms. We have intangible assets, whose values may become impaired. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $10.7 billion as of December 31, 2004, 36 Table of Contents representing approximately 38% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions, it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. We must comply with emerging restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information when providing services to us. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA. HIPAA also imposes guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. Compliance with these proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Our knowledge and information-related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services. The effects of the war on terror and future terrorist attacks could impact the health care industry. The terrorist attacks launched on September 11, 2001, the war on terrorism, the threat of future acts of terrorism and the related concerns of customers and providers have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the U.S. economy in general and our industry specifically. Depending on the government’s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies, future acts of terrorism and bio-terrorism could lead to, among other things, increased use of health care services including, without limitation, hospital and physician services; loss of membership in health benefit programs we administer as a result of lay-offs or other reductions of employment; adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption of our information and payment systems; increased health care costs due to restrictions on our ability to carve out certain categories of risk, such as acts of terrorism; and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general.

731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, serving approximately 65 million Americans. Our focus is on improving the American health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery; promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care; and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care providers, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and informatics; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. We provide individuals with access to quality, cost-effective health care services and resources. We promote the delivery of care, consistent with the best available evidence for effective health care. We provide employers and consumers with superb value, service, and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline. 2005 Financial Performance Highlights UnitedHealth Group had a very strong year in 2005. The company achieved diversified growth across its business segments and generated net earnings of $3.3 billion, representing an increase of 28% over 2004. Other financial performance highlights include: • Diluted net earnings per common share of $2.48, an increase of 26% over 2004. • Revenues of $45.4 billion, a 22% increase over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased 11% over 2004. • Earnings from operations of $5.4 billion, up 31% over 2004. • Operating margin of 11.8%, up from 11.0% in 2004. UnitedHealth Group acquired PacifiCare Health Plans, Inc. (PacifiCare) in December 2005 for total consideration of approximately $8.8 billion, Oxford Health Plans, Inc. (Oxford) in July 2004 for total consideration of approximately $5.0 billion and Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. (MAMSI) in February 2004 for total consideration of approximately $2.7 billion. The results of operations and financial condition of PacifiCare, Oxford and MAMSI have been included in UnitedHealth Group’s consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates. 2005 Results Compared to 2004 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues consist of premium revenues from risk-based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both 18 Table of Contents premium risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Consolidated revenues in 2005 increased by $8.1 billion, or 22%, to $45.4 billion. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11% in 2005 primarily as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth in individuals served across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2005 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues totaled $41.1 billion in 2005, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 23%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, consolidated premium revenues increased by approximately 11% over 2004. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and a modest increase in the number of individuals served by our risk-based products. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by $5.1 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by approximately 9% over 2004. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products. In addition, Ovations premium revenues increased by $1.8 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately 20% over 2004, driven primarily by an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products and by Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members, as well as rate increases on these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs increased by approximately $270 million, or 9%, over 2004 driven primarily by premium rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase is due mainly to strong growth in the number of individuals served by several Specialized Care Services businesses under premium-based arrangements. Service Revenues Service revenues in 2005 totaled $3.8 billion, an increase of $473 million, or 14%, over 2004. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2005, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by more than 20% due to growth in the health information and clinical research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $499 million, representing an increase of $111 million over 2004. Interest income increased by $126 million in 2005, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year due to the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI as well as higher yields on fixed-income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $4 million in 2005, a decrease of $15 million from 2004. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 80.6% in 2004 to 79.7% in 2005. Excluding the AARP business1, 19 1 Management believes disclosure of the medical care ratio excluding the AARP business is meaningful since underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through a rate stabilization fund (RSF). Although the company is at risk for underwriting losses to the extent cumulative net losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits to date, and management believes the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract during the foreseeable future. Table of Contents the medical care ratio decreased from 79.5% in 2004 to 78.6% in 2005. These medical care ratio decreases resulted primarily from changes in product, business and customer mix and an increase in favorable medical cost development related to prior periods. Each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information, identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. On an absolute dollar basis, 2005 medical costs increased $5.7 billion, or 21%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 9% driven primarily by a 7% to 8% increase in medical cost trend due to both inflation and a slight increase in health care consumption as well as organic growth. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2005 was 15.0%, down from 15.4% in 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee-based revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2005 increased $1.1 billion, or 19%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 11%. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in total individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2005, excluding the impact of acquisitions, growth in Specialized Care Services and Ingenix and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2005 was $453 million, an increase of $79 million, or 21%, over 2004. Approximately $32 million of this increase was related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2004. The remaining increase is primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.7% in 2005, compared to 34.9% in 2004. The increase was mainly driven by favorable settlements of prior year tax returns during 2004. Excluding these settlements, the 2004 effective tax rate would have been approximately the same as the 2005 effective tax rate. 20 Table of Contents Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2005 2004 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 40,019 $ 32,673 22 % Uniprise 3,850 3,365 14 % Specialized Care Services 2,806 2,295 22 % Ingenix 794 670 19 % Intersegment Eliminations (2,104 ) (1,785 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 45,365 $ 37,218 22 % Earnings From Operations 2005 2004 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 3,815 $ 2,810 36 % Uniprise 799 677 18 % Specialized Care Services 582 485 20 % Ingenix 177 129 37 % Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 5,373 $ 4,101 31 % nm - not meaningful Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment is composed of the UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. UnitedHealthcare offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for local, small and mid-sized employers and individuals nationwide. Ovations provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, including the administration of supplemental health insurance coverage on behalf of AARP. AmeriChoice provides network-based health and well-being services to state Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program and other government-sponsored health care programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. Health Care Services had revenues of $40.0 billion in 2005, representing an increase of $7.3 billion, or 22%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $3.0 billion, or 11%, over 2004. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products. Ovations contributed approximately $1.2 billion to the revenue advance over 2004 largely attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members and by its Medicare Advantage products as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to an 8% increase in AmeriChoice’s revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions, driven primarily by premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2005 were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of $1.0 billion, or 36%, over 2004. This increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcare’s risk-based products, increases in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial fee-based products, and the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI during 2004. UnitedHealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio decreased to 78.2% in 2005 from 79.0% in 2004 mainly due to changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ 2005 operating margin was 9.5%, an 21 Table of Contents increase from 8.6% in 2004. This increase was driven mainly by the lower commercial medical care ratio as well as changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 311: (in thousands) 20052 2004 Commercial Risk-based 7,765 7,655 Fee-based 3,895 3,305 Total Commercial 11,660 10,960 Medicare 395 330 Medicaid 1,250 1,260 Total Health Care Services 13,305 12,550 1 Excludes individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members. 2 Excludes commercial risk-based membership of approximately 2.3 million, commercial fee-based membership of approximately 100,000 and Medicare membership of approximately 750,000 related to the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare. These amounts have been excluded since the impact of PacifiCare on our 2005 consolidated financial results is not significant. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business as of December 31, 2005, excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, increased by approximately 700,000 over the prior year. This included an increase of 590,000 in the number of individuals served with fee-based products driven by the addition of approximately 335,000 individuals served resulting from new customer relationships and customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products as well as approximately 255,000 individuals served by a benefits administrative services company acquired in December 2005. In addition, the number of individuals served with commercial risk-based products increased by 110,000 driven primarily by the addition of approximately 130,000 individuals served by Neighborhood Health Partnership, acquired in September 2005, and a slight increase in net new customer relationships offset by customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products. Excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products increased by 65,000, or 20%, over 2004 due primarily to new customer relationships. AmeriChoice’s Medicaid enrollment decreased by 10,000 from 2004 due primarily to the withdrawal of participation in one market during the third quarter of 2005 partially offset by new customer relationships since 2004. Uniprise Uniprise provides network-based health and well-being services, business-to-business transaction processing services, consumer connectivity and technology support services nationwide to large employers and health plans, and provides health-related consumer and financial transaction products and services. Uniprise revenues in 2005 were $3.9 billion, representing an increase of $485 million, or 14%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Uniprise revenues increased approximately 12% over 2004. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 7% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers. Uniprise served 10.5 million individuals and 9.9 million individuals as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2005 were $799 million, representing an increase of $122 million, or 18%, over 2004. Operating margin for 2005 improved to 20.8% from 20.1% in 2004. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction 22 Table of Contents processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprise’s infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services offers a comprehensive platform of specialty health, wellness and ancillary benefits, networks, services and resources to specific customer markets nationwide. Specialized Care Services revenues of $2.8 billion increased by $511 million, or 22%, over 2004. This increase was principally driven by an 11% increase in the number of individuals served by its specialty benefit businesses, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and rate increases related to these businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 of $582 million increased $97 million, or 20%, over 2004. Specialized Care Services’ operating margin was 20.7% in 2005, down from 21.1% in 2004. This decrease was due to a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by continued gains in quality initiatives and operating cost efficiencies. Ingenix Ingenix offers database and data management services, software products, publications, consulting services, outsourced services and pharmaceutical development and consulting services on a national and international basis. Ingenix 2005 revenues of $794 million increased by $124 million, or 19%, over 2004. This was driven primarily by growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 were $177 million, up $48 million, or 37%, from 2004. Operating margin was 22.3% in 2005, up from 19.3% in 2004. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. 2004 Results Compared to 2003 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues increased by $8.4 billion, or 29%, in 2004 to $37.2 billion, primarily as a result of revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004 as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2004 consolidated revenue trends for each of our three revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues in 2004 totaled $33.5 billion, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 32%, over 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, premium revenues increased by approximately 8% in 2004. This increase was due in part to average net premium rate increases of approximately 9% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based business, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products and changes in the commercial product benefit and customer mix. In addition, Ovations’ premium revenues increased largely due to increases in the number of individuals it serves through Medicare Advantage products and changes in product mix related to Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on all of these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs and Specialized Care Services’ businesses also increased due to advances in the number of individuals served by those businesses. 23 Table of Contents Service Revenues Service revenues in 2004 totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $217 million, or 7%, over 2003. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased due to new business growth in the health information and clinical research businesses. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $388 million, representing an increase of $131 million over 2003. Interest income increased by $134 million in 2004, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year from the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule Financial Corporation (Golden Rule), which was acquired in November 2003. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $19 million in 2004, a decrease of $3 million from 2003. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 81.4% in 2003 to 80.6% in 2004. Excluding the AARP business, the medical care ratio decreased from 80.0% in 2003 to 79.5% in 2004. The medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in product, business and customer mix. Each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2003 include approximately $150 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. On an absolute dollar basis, 2004 medical costs increased $6.3 billion, or 30%, over 2003 principally due to the impact of the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 8% driven primarily by medical cost inflation and a moderate increase in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2004 was 15.4%, down from 16.9% in 2003. This decrease was driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. The existence of premium revenues within our risk-based products cause them to have lower operating cost ratios than fee-based products, which have no premium revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2004 increased $868 million, or 18%, over 2003 primarily due to the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 3%. This increase was driven by a more than 3% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise in 2004, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2004 was $374 million, an increase of $75 million, or 25%, over 2003. Approximately $42 million of this increase is related to intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in 2004. The remaining increase is due primarily to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 34.9% in 2004, compared to 35.7% in 2003. The decrease was driven mainly by favorable settlements of prior year income tax returns during 2004. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2004 2003 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 32,673 $ 24,807 32 % Uniprise 3,365 3,107 8 % Specialized Care Services 2,295 1,878 22 % Ingenix 670 574 17 % Intersegment Eliminations (1,785 ) (1,543 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 37,218 $ 28,823 29 % Earnings From Operations 2004 2003 PercentChange Health Care Services $ 2,810 $ 1,865 51 % Uniprise 677 610 11 % Specialized Care Services 485 385 26 % Ingenix 129 75 72 % Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 4,101 $ 2,935 40 % nm - not meaningful Health Care Services Health Care Services had revenues of $32.7 billion in 2004, representing an increase of $7.9 billion, or 32%, over 2003, driven primarily by acquisitions since the beginning of 2003. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $1.9 billion, or 8%, over 2003. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $850 million of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 9% on renewing commercial risk-based business and growth in the number of individuals served by fee-based products, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products. Ovations contributed approximately $770 million to the revenue advance over 2003 driven by growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products and changes in product mix related to Medicare supplement products it provides to AARP members, as well as rate increases on all of these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs and Medicaid premium rate increases. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2004 were $2.8 billion, representing an increase of $945 million, or 51%, over 2003. This increase primarily resulted from Ovations’ and UnitedHealthcare’s revenue growth, improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products and the impact of the acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and Golden Rule. UnitedHealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio decreased to 79.0% in 2004 from 80.0% in 2003. The decrease in the commercial medical care ratio was primarily driven by net premium rate increases that slightly exceeded overall medical benefit cost increases and changes in business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ 2004 operating margin was 8.6%, an increase of 110 basis 25 Table of Contents points over 2003. This increase was principally driven by a combination of the improved commercial medical care ratio and changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 311: (in thousands) 2004 2003 Commercial Risk-based 7,655 5,400 Fee-based 3,305 2,895 Total Commercial 10,960 8,295 Medicare 330 230 Medicaid 1,260 1,105 Total Health Care Services 12,550 9,630 1 Excludes individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business as of December 31, 2004, increased by nearly 2.7 million, or 32%, over the prior year. Excluding the 2004 acquisitions of Oxford, MAMSI and a smaller regional health plan, the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business increased by 245,000. This included an increase of 285,000 in the number of individuals served with fee-based products, driven by new customer relationships and existing customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products, partially offset by a decrease of 40,000 in the number of individuals served with risk-based products resulting primarily from customers converting to self-funded, fee-based arrangements and a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment. Excluding the impact of the Oxford acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products increased by 30,000, or 13%, from 2003. AmeriChoice’s Medicaid enrollment increased by 155,000, or 14%, due to organic growth in the number of individuals served and the acquisition of a Medicaid health plan in Michigan in February 2004, resulting in the addition of approximately 95,000 individuals served. Uniprise Uniprise revenues in 2004 were $3.4 billion, representing an increase of 8% over 2003. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers. Uniprise served 9.9 million individuals and 9.1 million individuals as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2004 were $677 million, representing an increase of 11% over 2003. Operating margin for 2004 improved to 20.1% from 19.6% in 2003. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services revenues during 2004 of $2.3 billion increased by $417 million, or 22%, over 2003. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by its behavioral health benefits business, its dental services business and its vision care benefits business; rate increases related to these businesses; and incremental revenues related to businesses acquired since the beginning of 2003 of approximately $100 million. 26 Table of Contents Earnings from operations in 2004 of $485 million increased $100 million, or 26%, over 2003. Specialized Care Services’ operating margin increased to 21.1% in 2004, up from 20.5% in 2003. This increase was driven primarily by operational and productivity improvements within Specialized Care Services’ businesses and consolidation of the production and service operation infrastructure to enhance productivity and efficiency and to improve the quality and consistency of service, partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix revenues in 2004 of $670 million increased by $96 million, or 17%, over 2003. This was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses. Earnings from operations in 2004 were $129 million, up $54 million, or 72%, from 2003. Operating margin was 19.3% in 2004, up from 13.1% in 2003. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth and improving gross margins in the health information and clinical research businesses. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2005 Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors’ approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long-term investments are also available for sale to meet short-term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long-term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs. In 2005, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $130 million. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. 27 Table of Contents Cash and Investments Cash flows from operating activities were $4.3 billion in 2005, an increase over $4.1 billion in 2004. The increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of $834 million in net income prior to depreciation, amortization and other noncash items partially offset by a decrease of $643 million in cash flows generated from working capital changes. We generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of $406 million in 2005 and $1,049 million in 2004. The year-over-year decrease primarily resulted from the Company receiving only eleven monthly Medicare premium payments during 2005 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rather than the twelve monthly payments received in 2004, negatively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by $375 million. Additionally, there was reduced growth in medical payables during 2005 compared to 2004 due in part to an increase in electronic claim submissions and other disbursement process efficiencies. We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with cash and investments of $15.0 billion at December 31, 2005. Total cash and investments increased by $2.7 billion since December 31, 2004, primarily due to cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, strong operating cash flows and cash received from debt issuances, partially offset by common stock repurchases, cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. As further described under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2005, approximately $270 million of our $15.0 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Financing and Investing Activities In addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities, we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately $7.1 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 28.6% and 27.3% as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. We believe the prudent use of debt leverage optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. On December 20, 2005, the company acquired PacifiCare. Under the terms of the agreement, PacifiCare shareholders received 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $21.50 in cash for each share of PacifiCare common stock they owned. Total consideration issued for the transaction was approximately $8.8 billion, composed of approximately 99.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $5.3 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group’s share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of July 6, 2005), approximately $2.1 billion in cash, $960 million cash paid to retire PacifiCare’s existing debt and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately $420 million issued in exchange for PacifiCare’s outstanding vested common stock options. On February 24, 2006, our Health Care Services business segment acquired John Deere Health Care, Inc. (John Deere Health). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $500 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of John Deere Health. We issued commercial paper to finance the John Deere Health purchase price. On September 19, 2005, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $185 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of NHP. We issued commercial paper to finance the NHP purchase price. On December 10, 2004, our Uniprise business segment acquired Definity Health Corporation (Definity). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid $305 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Definity. We used available cash and issued commercial paper to finance the Definity purchase price. 28 Table of Contents On July 29, 2004, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Oxford. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Oxford shareholders received 1.2714 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $16.17 in cash for each share of Oxford common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $5.0 billion, composed of approximately 104.4 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $3.4 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group’s share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of April 26, 2004), approximately $1.3 billion in cash and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of $240 million issued in exchange for Oxford’s outstanding vested common stock options. On February 10, 2004, our Health Care Services business segment acquired MAMSI. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, MAMSI shareholders received 1.64 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $18 in cash for each share of MAMSI common stock they owned. Total consideration issued was approximately $2.7 billion, composed of 72.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at $1.9 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group’s share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of October 27, 2003) and approximately $800 million in cash. In November and December 2005, we issued $2.6 billion of commercial paper primarily to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the PacifiCare acquisition described above and to retire a portion of the PacifiCare debt at the closing of the acquisition, as well as to refinance current maturities of long-term debt. As of December 31, 2005, our outstanding commercial paper had interest rates ranging from 4.2% to 4.4%. In March 2005, we issued $500 million of 4.9% fixed-rate notes due March 2015. We used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes including repayment of commercial paper, capital expenditures, working capital and share repurchases. In July 2004, we issued $1.2 billion of commercial paper to fund the cash portion of the Oxford purchase price. In August 2004, we refinanced the commercial paper by issuing $550 million of 3.4% fixed-rate notes due August 2007, $450 million of 4.1% fixed-rate notes due August 2009 and $500 million of 5.0% fixed-rate notes due August 2014. In February 2004, we issued $250 million of 3.8% fixed-rate notes due February 2009 and $250 million of 4.8% fixed-rate notes due February 2014. We used the proceeds from the February 2004 borrowings to finance a majority of the cash portion of the MAMSI purchase price as described above. To more closely align interest costs with the floating interest rate received on our cash and cash equivalent balances, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges. The interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of $3.4 billion with variable rates that are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At December 31, 2005, the rate used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 4.3% to 5.0%. The differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In December 2005, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program. We increased the capacity to $1.3 billion and extended the maturity date to December 2010. In October 2005, we executed a $3.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility to support a $3.0 billion increase in our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2005, we had no amounts outstanding under either of these credit facilities. PacifiCare had approximately $100 million par value of 3% convertible subordinated debentures (convertible notes) which were convertible into approximately 5.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group’s common stock and $102 million of cash as of December 31, 2005. In December 2005, we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture 29 Table of Contents governing the convertible notes. The compensation consisted of the present value of interest through October 18, 2007, the earliest mandatory redemption date, plus a pro rata share of $1 million. On January 31, 2006, approximately 91% of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer, for which we issued 4.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and cash of $99 million. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity) below 45% and to exceed specified minimum interest coverage levels. We are in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants. Our senior debt is rated “A” by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Fitch, and “A2” by Moody’s. Our commercial paper is rated “A-1” by S&P, “F-1” by Fitch, and “P-1” by Moody’s. Consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the “A” range, we currently intend to maintain our debt-to-total-capital ratio at approximately 30% or less. A significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. Under our board of directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased 53.6 million shares at an average price of approximately $48 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2005, we had board of directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 55.5 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital. A decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility. We currently have a $4.0 billion universal S-3 shelf registration statement (for common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities) which has been declared effective by the SEC. In addition, we are considered a “well known seasoned issuer” under the Securities Offering Reform Act that became effective in December 2005. We have not yet issued any securities under this shelf registration statement. We may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering. We intend to issue debt securities during the first quarter of 2006 to refinance some or all of the commercial paper currently outstanding. Under our S-4 acquisition shelf registration statement, we have remaining issuing capacity of 48.6 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities. We filed separate S-4 registration statements for the 72.8 million shares issued in connection with the February 2004 acquisition of MAMSI, the 104.4 million shares issued in connection with the July 2004 acquisition of Oxford and the 99.2 million shares issued in connection with the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare described previously. 30 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2005, under our various contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments (in millions): 2006 2007 to 2008 2009 to 2010 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper1 $ 3,261 $ 1,450 $ 700 $ 1,700 $ 7,111 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper2 194 299 191 302 986 Operating Leases 167 287 183 172 809 Purchase Obligations3 151 45 6 — 202 Future Policy Benefits4 120 305 280 1,176 1,881 Other Long-Term Obligations5 — 56 — 302 358 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,893 $ 2,442 $ 1,360 $ 3,652 $ 11,347 1 Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. 2 Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2005 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. 3 Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. 4 Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay (see Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements). 5 Includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments. Currently, we do not have any other material contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. AARP In January 1998, we entered into a 10-year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare. Under the terms of the contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. Premium revenues from our portion of the AARP insurance offerings were approximately $4.9 billion in 2005, $4.5 billion in 2004 and $4.1 billion in 2003. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member services expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract. 31 Table of Contents Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract The Company has contracted with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to serve as a Prescription Drug Plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage to eligible Medicare beneficiaries, beginning January 1, 2006. This product is either offered as a stand-alone product or as an element of the Medicare Advantage products. As a result of this contract and the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare, premium revenues from Medicare-related programs, which have historically been approximately 10% of total premium revenues, are expected to increase to approximately 25% in 2006. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions We conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. The agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings. Consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the “A” range, we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. As of December 31, 2005, our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately $6.4 billion, which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, provider contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care provider and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to 12 months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the 32 Table of Contents period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations (in millions). FavorableDevelopment Net Impacton MedicalCosts(a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations As Reported As Adjusted(b) As Reported As Adjusted(b) 2002 $ 70 ($ 80 ) $ 18,192 $ 18,112 $ 2,186 $ 2,266 2003 $ 150 ($ 60 ) $ 20,714 $ 20,654 $ 2,935 $ 2,995 2004 $ 210 ($ 190 ) $ 27,000 $ 26,810 $ 4,101 $ 4,291 2005 $ 400 (c ) $ 32,725 (c ) $ 5,373 (c ) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2006 will change as our December 31, 2005 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2006. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of the company’s liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2005, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company’s liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2005; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2005 estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2005 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $63 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.03 per share. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages, if any, for such matters. We do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets As of December 31, 2005, we had long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, equipment and capitalized software, of $19.9 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the 33 Table of Contents reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long-lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period, and record changes in the period they become known. Investments As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $9.6 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2005, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $105 million and gross unrealized losses of $53 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Inflation The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers. Through contracts with physicians and other health care providers, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. 34 Table of Contents Legal Matters Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. We record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against both UnitedHealthcare and PacifiCare, and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. In December 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving UnitedHealth Group and our affiliates, including PacifiCare, in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. The trial court granted the health care providers’ motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the class action status of the RICO claims, but reversed as to the breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. During the course of the litigation, there have been co-defendant settlements. Through a series of motions and appeals, all direct claims against us have been compelled to arbitration. A trial date has been set for September 2006. The trial court has ordered that the trial be split into separate liability and damage proceedings. In August 2005, the capitation-related claims were dismissed from litigation. On January 31, 2006, the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against PacifiCare. A March 14, 2006 hearing date has been scheduled for our summary judgment motion. On March 15, 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against the company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. On April 13, 2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA claims and the claims brought by the American Medical Association, a third amended complaint was filed. On October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On May 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the American Medical Association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff. On May 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. On July 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to assert RICO violations. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described above, will, individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The company’s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long-term debt. 35 Table of Contents Approximately $14.7 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2005 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed-income investment portfolio at December 31, 2005, the fair value of our fixed-income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $345 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long-term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short-term investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $6.2 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately $0.9 billion had fixed rates as of December 31, 2005. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt. At December 31, 2005, we had $261 million of equity investments, a portion of which were held by our UnitedHealth Capital business in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject UnitedHealth Group to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As discussed more fully in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we have a $1.8 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our life and annuity business. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2005, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “seeks,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may 36 Table of Contents turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications. We must effectively manage our health care costs. Under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based products (excluding AARP) have typically comprised approximately 75% to 80% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. We base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period; however, inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for UnitedHealthcare’s commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2005 would have been reduced by approximately $130 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. If these estimates prove too high or too low, the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results. That change can be either positive or negative to our results. We face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care Services segments, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Humana Inc., and WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized Care Services and Ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses. The addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or provider arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. Our relationship with AARP is important. Under our 10-year contract with AARP, which commenced in 1998, we provide Medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to AARP members. As of December 31, 2005, our portion of AARP’s insurance program represented approximately $4.9 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 3.8 million AARP members. The AARP contract may be terminated early by us or AARP under certain circumstances, including a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material 37 Table of Contents adverse change in the financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangement depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. Some of the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in Medicare remain uncertain. The changes in Medicare as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) are complex and wide-ranging and continue to affect our businesses. We have taken advantage of new opportunities to partner with the federal government created by the MMA, including Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage Regional PPOs, and Special Needs Plans for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. We have invested considerable resources in creating new Medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the MMA. In particular, the Part D program presents challenges because of the size and scope of the new program. Our ability to successfully participate in the Part D program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us, CMS and state governments. We have been working with CMS to correct systems issues that they have experienced with respect to certain low income people eligible to participate in Part D. The inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our participation in the Part D program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, pharmaceutical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Part D program or otherwise, our results could be materially affected. Any positive or negative results of the Part D program are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our Part D program. We are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. We participate as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Our business is subject to routine government scrutiny, and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. 38 Table of Contents State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; and government-sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation, or, if enacted, what their terms will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. We typically are involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition, public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services. Relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices. A number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws. In any particular market, these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider. To the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that are the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. The nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. In 1999, a number of class action lawsuits were filed against UnitedHealthcare and PacifiCare and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business, although all claims against PacifiCare have been dismissed. The suits are 39 Table of Contents purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO . In March 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. Although the expenses we have incurred to date in defending the 1999 class action lawsuits and the American Medical Association lawsuit have not been material to our business, we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters, even if they are without merit. The Company is largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks; however, we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims. Although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. Our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products. In connection with the PacifiCare merger, we acquired a pharmacy benefits management business, Prescription Solutions. We also provide pharmacy benefits management services through UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions. Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions are subject to federal and state anti-remuneration and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. Federal and state legislatures are considering new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. In addition, if a court were to determine that our PBM business acts as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies, preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs, contracting network practices, speciality drug distribution and other transactions. Our PBM also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our PBM subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. We also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy. Our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care providers have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. The value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $18.2 billion as of December 31, 2005, representing approximately 44% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible 40 Table of Contents assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Our knowledge and information-related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services. We must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA). HIPAA also imposes guidelines on our business associates (as this term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. Compliance with these proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. The anticipated benefits of acquiring PacifiCare may not be realized. We acquired PacifiCare with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits including, among others, benefits relating to a stronger and more diverse network of doctors and other health care providers, expanded and enhanced affordable health care services, enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for UnitedHealth Group in the Western United States, cross-selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether UnitedHealth Group integrates PacifiCare in an efficient and effective manner and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results.

Our focus is on improving the American health care system by simplifying the administrative components of health care delivery; promoting evidence-based medicine as the standard for care; and providing relevant, actionable data that physicians, health care providers, consumers, employers and other participants in health care can use to make better, more informed decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and informatics; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. We provide individuals with access to quality, cost-effective health care services and resources. We provide employers and consumers with superb value, service and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline. Financial Restatements All of the financial information presented in this Item 7 has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Company’s financial results, which is more fully described in the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The impact under FAS 123R of recognizing additional stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects as a result of historic stock option practices as well as immaterial adjustments unrelated to historic stock option practices that were identified through a review of the Company’s accounting practices is $43 million ($57 million net of tax) in 2005, $40 million ($44 million net of tax) in 2004, and an aggregate of $453 million ($313 million net of tax) for 2003 and all prior years. The impact under APB 25 of all errors is $304 million ($238 million net of tax) in 2005, $200 million ($158 million net of tax) in 2004, and an aggregate of $1,056 million ($738 million net of tax) for 2003 and all prior years. The Company also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustment would have changed under two alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates. See “— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Stock Option Measurement Dates” for details. 30 Table of Contents The following tables illustrate the effect of the restatement adjustments on our pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share if we had recorded compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value accounting method as defined by FAS 123 for all stock-based awards granted from 1995 to 2003. Refer to Note 3 for an illustration of the effect of the FAS 123R restatement adjustments relating to 2004 and 2005.

The Company achieved diversified growth across its business segments and generated net earnings of $4.2 billion, representing an increase of 35% over 2005. Other financial performance highlights include: • Diluted net earnings per common share of $2.97, an increase of 29% over 2005. • Consolidated revenues of $71.5 billion, an increase of 54% over 2005, with revenues advancing in each business segment. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased 21% over 2005. • Earnings from operations of $7.0 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 37%, over 2005. • Operating margin of 9.8%, down from 10.9% in 2005, primarily due to changes in business mix related to the PacifiCare acquisition and the launch of the Medicare Part D program. • Cash flows from operations of $6.5 billion, up from $4.1 billion in 2005. 31 Table of Contents 2006 Results Compared to 2005 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues are comprised of premium revenues from risk-based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; product revenues; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both premium risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, revenues are derived from products sold and from administrative services. Product revenues are recognized upon sale or shipment because the price is fixed and the member may not return the drugs or receive a refund. Service revenues are recognized when the prescription claim is adjudicated. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix syndicated content products, which are recognized as revenue upon shipment. Consolidated revenues in 2006 of $71.5 billion increased by $25.1 billion, or 54%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 21% in 2006 principally driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program on January 1, 2006, rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth in individuals served across our business segments. Following is a discussion of 2006 consolidated revenue trends for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues totaled $65.7 billion in 2006, an increase of $23.6 billion, or 56%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, consolidated premium revenues increased by $8.8 billion, or 21%, over 2005. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk-based products. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues in 2006 totaled $33.5 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion, or 29%, over 2005. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, UnitedHealthcare premium revenues were essentially flat compared to 2005. This was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products, offset by lower premium yields from new business due primarily to a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high-deductible lower-premium products (with correspondingly lower medical costs), and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products due primarily to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee-based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2006 totaled $24.4 billion, an increase of $15.2 billion, or 165%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately $8.3 billion, or 92%, over 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. Specialized Care Services premium revenues increased by approximately $1.0 billion over 2005. This was primarily due to the PacifiCare acquisition and strong growth in the number of individuals served by several Specialized Care Services businesses under premium-based arrangements. The remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and premium revenue rate increases in AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs, which contributed premium revenue increases of approximately $278 million, or 8%, over 2005 excluding the impact of acquisitions. 32 Table of Contents Service Revenues Service revenues in 2006 totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of $602 million, or 16%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, service revenues increased by approximately 12% over 2005. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2006, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by approximately 23% due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Product Revenues Product revenues in 2006 totaled $737 million, an increase of $579 million over 2005. This was primarily due to pharmacy revenues at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income during 2006 totaled $871 million, representing an increase of $366 million over 2005. Interest income increased by $372 million in 2006, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year, due in part to the acquisition of PacifiCare, as well as higher yields on fixed-income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $4 million in 2006, compared with net capital gains of $10 million in 2005. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio increased from 80.0% in 2005 to 81.2% in 2006. This medical care ratio increase resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of PacifiCare and launch of the Medicare Part D program, both of which carry a higher medical care ratio than the historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information and other facts and circumstances, that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2006 include approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2006 was driven by an increase in medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Medical costs for 2006 increased $19.6 billion, or 58%, to $53.3 billion, due to the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program and a medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk-based business. Medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program for 2006 were $4.9 billion. Medical trend was due to both medical inflation and increases in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2006 of 14.0%, improved from 15.4% in 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program and the PacifiCare acquisition. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee-based revenues. The decrease in the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration, and an insurance recovery of $43 million. These items were partially offset by a $22 million charitable contribution to the United Health Foundation and approximately $44 million of additional cash expenses related to the stock option review, exclusive of the FAS 123R compensation expense. 33 Table of Contents Operating costs in 2006 totaled $10.0 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 40%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 13% over 2005. This increase was primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program as well as a 4% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2006 (excluding the impact of acquisitions), growth in Specialized Care Services and Ingenix, general operating cost inflation, and the specific items discussed above, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment, cost savings associated with acquisition integrations and other cost management initiatives. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2006 totaled $599 million, an increase of $510 million over 2005. This increase was primarily due to pharmacy sales at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2006 was $670 million, an increase of $217 million, or 48%, over 2005. Approximately $85 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from PacifiCare and other businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. The remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in 2006 and in 2005. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2006 2005 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 64,180 $ 40,023 60% Uniprise 5,451 4,893 11% Specialized Care Services 3,989 2,806 42% Ingenix 976 807 21% Intersegment Eliminations (3,054 ) (2,104 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 71,542 $ 46,425 54% Earnings From Operations 2006 2005 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 5,128 $ 3,664 40% Uniprise 897 740 21% Specialized Care Services 769 541 42% Ingenix 190 135 41% Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 6,984 $ 5,080 37% nm - not meaningful 34 Table of Contents Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment is composed of the UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. UnitedHealthcare offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for local, small and mid-sized employers and individuals nationwide. Ovations provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, including the administration of supplemental health insurance coverage on behalf of AARP and the delivery of the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit to beneficiaries throughout the United States. AmeriChoice provides network-based health and well-being services to state Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Programs and other government-sponsored health care programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. The financial results of UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice have been combined in the Health Care Services segment column in the tables presented below because these businesses have similar economic characteristics and have similar products and services, types of customers, distribution methods and operational processes, and operate in a similar regulatory environment, typically within the same legal entity. Health Care Services had revenues of $64.2 billion in 2006, representing an increase of $24.2 billion, or 60%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $8.9 billion, or 23%, over 2005. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $35.2 billion in 2006 increased by $8.0 billion, or 29%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased by approximately 1% over 2005 due to an increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee-based products as well as average premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products, offset by lower premium yields from a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high-deductible lower-premium products (with correspondingly lower medical costs) and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial risk-based products due primarily to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee-based products. Ovations revenues of $25.3 billion in 2006 increased by approximately $15.9 billion, or 168% over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations revenues increased by $8.4 billion, or 91%, over 2005. The increase was driven primarily by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to an 8% increase in AmeriChoice revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions, driven primarily by membership growth and premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2006 were $5.1 billion, representing an increase of $1.5 billion, or 40%, over 2005. This increase was principally driven by acquisitions and increases in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare and Part D products and UnitedHealthcare’s fee-based products. The segment also benefited by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration. UnitedHealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio increased to 79.8% in 2006 from 78.6% in 2005, mainly due to the impact of the PacifiCare acquisition and changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ operating margin for 2006 was 8.0%, a decrease from 9.2% in 2005. This decrease was driven mainly by the acquisition of PacifiCare and the new Medicare Part D program, which have lower operating margins than historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31 (1): (in thousands) 2006 2005 Commercial Risk-based 10,040 10,105 Fee-based 4,735 3,990 Total Commercial 14,775 14,095 Medicare Advantage 1,410 1,150 Medicare Part D Stand-alone 4,500 — Medicaid 1,425 1,250 Total Health Care Services 22,110 16,495 (1) Excludes individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members as well as Medicare institutional and Medicaid long-term care members. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately 680,000, or 5%, over the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, commercial business individuals served increased by 185,000, or 1%, over the prior year. This included an increase of approximately 660,000 in the number of individuals served with commercial fee-based products, driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products, offset by a decrease of approximately 475,000 in the number of individuals served with commercial risk-based products due primarily to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee-based products. Excluding acquisitions, the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products increased by 230,000, or 20%, from 2005 due primarily to new customer relationships. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, AmeriChoice’s Medicaid enrollment increased 65,000, or 5%, primarily due to new customer gains. Uniprise Uniprise provides network-based health and well-being services, business-to-business transaction processing services, consumer connectivity and technology support services nationwide to large employers and health plans, and provides health-related consumer and financial transaction products and services. Uniprise revenues in 2006 were $5.5 billion, representing an increase of $558 million, or 11%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Uniprise revenues increased 7% over 2005. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 4% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers. Uniprise served 10.9 million individuals and 10.5 million individuals as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations for 2006 were $897 million, representing an increase of $157 million, or 21%, over 2005. Operating margin for 2006 improved to 16.5% for 2006 from 15.1% in 2005. Uniprise has expanded its operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprise’s infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services offers a comprehensive platform of specialty health, wellness and ancillary benefits, networks, services and resources to specific customer markets nationwide. Specialized Care Services revenues of 36 Table of Contents $4.0 billion increased by $1.2 billion, or 42%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenues increased by 22% over the prior periods. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. Earnings from operations in 2006 of $769 million increased $228 million, or 42%, over 2005. Specialized Care Services’ operating margin was 19.3% in 2006 and 2005. Realized improvements in operating cost structure and benefits from the integration of PacifiCare specialty operations in 2006 were offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix offers database and data management services, software products, publications, consulting services, outsourced services and pharmaceutical development and consulting services on a national and international basis. Ingenix revenues for 2006 of $976 million increased by $169 million, or 21%, over 2005. This was driven primarily by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses, as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Earnings from operations in 2006 were $190 million, up $55 million, or 41%, from 2005. Operating margin was 19.5% in 2006, up from 16.7% in 2005. These increases in earnings from operations and operating margin were primarily due to growth in the health information and pharmaceutical services businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. 2005 Results Compared to 2004 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues in 2005 increased by $8.2 billion, or 21%, to $46.4 billion. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 11% in 2005 primarily as a result of rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth in individuals served across business segments. Following is a discussion of 2005 consolidated revenue trends for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues Consolidated premium revenues totaled $42.1 billion in 2005, an increase of $7.7 billion, or 22%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, consolidated premium revenues increased by approximately 11% over 2004. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and a modest increase in the number of individuals served by our risk-based products. UnitedHealthcare premium revenues in 2005 totaled $25.9 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004, UnitedHealthcare premium revenues increased by approximately 9% over 2004. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products. In addition, Ovations premium revenues in 2005 totaled $9.2 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 24%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately 20% over 2004, driven primarily by an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products and by Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members, as well as rate increases on these products. Premium revenues from AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs in 2005 totaled $3.3 billion, an increase of $270 million, or 9%, over 2004 driven primarily by premium rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase is due mainly to strong growth in the number of individuals served by several Specialized Care Services businesses under premium-based arrangements. Service Revenues Service revenues in 2005 totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of $423 million, or 13%, over 2004. The increase in service revenues was driven primarily by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals 37 Table of Contents served by Uniprise and UnitedHealthcare under fee-based arrangements during 2005, excluding the impact of acquisitions, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by 16% due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Product Revenues Product revenues in 2005 totaled $158 million, an increase of $36 million over 2004. This was primarily due to pharmacy revenues at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare, and increased revenues associated with the interim government-sponsored drug card program. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $505 million, representing an increase of $92 million over 2004. Interest income increased by $126 million in 2005, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year due to the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI as well as higher yields on fixed-income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $10 million in 2005, a decrease of $34 million from 2004. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio. The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 80.9% in 2004 to 80.0% in 2005. This medical care ratio decrease resulted primarily from changes in product, business and customer mix and an increase in favorable medical cost development related to prior periods. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information, that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2004 include approximately $210 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2005 was driven primarily by growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. On an absolute dollar basis, 2005 medical costs totaled $33.7 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion, or 21%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, medical costs increased by approximately 9% driven primarily by a medical cost trend of 7% to 8% due to both inflation and an increase in health care consumption as well as organic growth. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2005 was 15.4%, down from 15.9% in 2004. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues largely due to recent acquisitions. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee-based revenues. Additionally, the decrease in the operating cost ratio reflects productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, operating costs for 2005 totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 17%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, operating costs increased by approximately 11%. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in total individuals served by Health Care Services and Uniprise during 2005 (excluding the impact of acquisitions), growth in Specialized Care Services and Ingenix and general operating cost inflation, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2005 totaled $89 million, an increase of $35 million over 2004. This was primarily due to pharmacy sales at our PBM business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare, and increased costs associated with sales under the interim government-sponsored drug card program. 38 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2005 was $453 million, an increase of $79 million, or 21%, over 2004. Approximately $32 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from business acquisitions since the beginning of 2004. The remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements and business growth. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in 2005, compared to 35.4% in 2004. The increase was mainly driven by favorable settlements of prior year tax returns during 2004 and an increase in 2005 state taxes. Business Segments The following summarizes the operating results of our business segments for the years ended December 31 (in millions): Revenues 2005 2004 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 40,023 $ 32,681 22% Uniprise 4,893 4,318 13% Specialized Care Services 2,806 2,296 22% Ingenix 807 707 14% Intersegment Eliminations (2,104 ) (1,785 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 46,425 $ 38,217 21% Earnings From Operations 2005 2004 PercentChange (As Restated) (As Restated) (As Restated) Health Care Services $ 3,664 $ 2,688 36% Uniprise 740 624 19% Specialized Care Services 541 445 22% Ingenix 135 101 34% Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 5,080 $ 3,858 32% nm - not meaningful Health Care Services Health Care Services had revenues of $40.0 billion in 2005, representing an increase of $7.3 billion, or 22%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $3.0 billion, or 11%, over 2004. UnitedHealthcare accounted for approximately $1.6 billion of this increase, driven by average premium rate increases of approximately 8% to 9% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products. Ovations contributed approximately $1.2 billion to the revenue advance over 2004 largely attributable to growth in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members and by its Medicare Advantage products as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to an 8% increase in AmeriChoice’s revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions, driven primarily by premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. 39 Table of Contents Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2005 were $3.7 billion, representing an increase of $976 million, or 36%, over 2004. This increase primarily resulted from revenue growth and improved gross margins on UnitedHealthcare’s risk-based products, increases in the number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial fee-based products, and the acquisitions of Oxford and MAMSI during 2004. UnitedHealthcare’s commercial medical care ratio decreased to 78.6% in 2005 from 79.3% in 2004 mainly due to changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ 2005 operating margin was 9.2%, an increase from 8.2% in 2004. This increase was driven mainly by the lower commercial medical care ratio as well as changes in business and customer mix. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31 (1): (in thousands) 2005 (2) 2004 Commercial Risk-based 10,105 7,655 Fee-based 3,990 3,305 Total Commercial 14,095 10,960 Medicare Advantage 1,150 330 Medicaid 1,250 1,260 Total Health Care Services 16,495 12,550 (1) Excludes individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare supplement products provided to AARP members as well as Medicare institutional and Medicaid long-term care members. (2) Includes commercial risk-based membership of 2.34 million, commercial fee-based membership of 95,000 and Medicare membership of 755,000 related to the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare. The number of individuals served by UnitedHealthcare’s commercial business as of December 31, 2005, excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, increased by approximately 700,000 over the prior year. This included an increase of 590,000 in the number of individuals served with fee-based products driven by the addition of approximately 335,000 individuals served resulting from new customer relationships and customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products as well as approximately 255,000 individuals served by a benefits administrative services company acquired in December 2005. In addition, the number of individuals served with commercial risk-based products increased by 110,000 driven primarily by the addition of approximately 130,000 individuals served by Neighborhood Health Partnership, acquired in September 2005, and a slight increase in net new customer relationships more than offset by customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products. Excluding the PacifiCare acquisition, the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare Advantage products increased by 65,000, or 20%, over 2004 due primarily to new customer relationships. AmeriChoice’s Medicaid enrollment decreased by 10,000 from 2004 due primarily to the withdrawal of participation in one market during the third quarter of 2005 partially offset by new customer relationships since 2004. Uniprise Uniprise revenues in 2005 were $4.9 billion, representing an increase of $575 million, or 13%, over 2004. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Uniprise revenues increased approximately 11% over 2004. This increase was driven primarily by growth of 7% in the number of individuals served by Uniprise, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers. Uniprise served 10.5 million individuals and 9.9 million individuals as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Uniprise earnings from operations in 2005 were $740 million, representing an increase of $116 million, or 19%, over 2004. Operating margin for 2005 improved to 15.1% from 14.5% in 2004. Uniprise has expanded its 40 Table of Contents operating margin through operating cost efficiencies derived from process improvements, technology deployment and cost management initiatives that have reduced labor and occupancy costs in its transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. Additionally, Uniprise’s infrastructure can be scaled efficiently, allowing its business to grow revenues at a proportionately higher rate than the associated growth in operating expenses. Specialized Care Services Specialized Care Services revenues of $2.8 billion increased by $510 million, or 22%, over 2004. This increase was principally driven by an 11% increase in the number of individuals served by its specialty benefit businesses, excluding the impact of acquisitions, and rate increases related to these businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 of $541 million increased $96 million, or 22%, over 2004. Specialized Care Services’ operating margin was 19.3% in 2005, down from 19.4% in 2004. This decrease was due to a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by continued gains in quality initiatives and operating cost efficiencies. Ingenix Ingenix 2005 revenues of $807 million increased by $100 million, or 14%, over 2004. This was driven primarily by growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Earnings from operations in 2005 were $135 million, up $34 million, or 34%, from 2004. Ingenix’s operating margin was 16.7% in 2005, up from 14.3% in 2004. The increase in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2004. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources at December 31, 2006 Liquidity and Capital Resources We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long-term investments are also available for sale to meet short-term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long-term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending 41 Table of Contents on market conditions. In August 2006, we announced that we would not purchase shares under our stock repurchase program until we had completed our restatement (which is reflected in this Form 10-K) and become current in our periodic SEC filings. As a result, we did not repurchase any shares through this publicly announced program for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs. In 2006, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $170 million. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. However, a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for the Company or limit the Company’s access to capital. See “— Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices — Credit Ratings” for additional information. Cash and Investments Cash flows from operating activities were $6.5 billion in 2006, an increase over $4.1 billion in 2005. The increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of $1.3 billion in net income prior to depreciation, amortization and other noncash items as well as an increase of approximately $1.1 billion in cash flows generated from working capital changes. We generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of $1.6 billion in 2006 and $412 million in 2005. The year-over-year increase primarily resulted from the Company receiving twelve monthly Medicare premium payments during 2006 from CMS rather than the eleven monthly payments received in 2005, positively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by $275 million, along with growth in medical payables during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by overall growth of the insured business. Additionally, there was an increase in accrued taxes payable due largely to an increase in pre-tax earnings. We maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with cash and investments of $20.6 billion at December 31, 2006. Total cash and investments increased by $5.6 billion since December 31, 2005, primarily due to strong operating cash flows, cash received from debt and common stock issuances, and cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006, partially offset by common stock repurchases, cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. As further described under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2006, approximately $1.9 billion of our $20.6 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Financing and Investing Activities In addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities, we use commercial paper and long-term debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had commercial paper and long-term debt outstanding of approximately $7.5 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 26.4% and 28.5% as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, 42 Table of Contents respectively. We believe the prudent use of debt optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. As of December 31, 2006, our outstanding commercial paper had interest rates of approximately 5.3% to 5.5%. On December 1, 2006, our Health Care Services business segment acquired the Student Insurance Division (Student Resources) of The MEGA Life and Health Insurance Company through an asset purchase agreement. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we issued a 10-year, 5.4% promissory note for approximately $95 million and paid approximately $1 million in cash in exchange for the net assets of Student Resources. On February 24, 2006, our Health Care Services business segment acquired John Deere Health Care, Inc. (JDHC). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $515 million in cash, including transaction costs, in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of JDHC. We issued commercial paper to finance the JDHC purchase price. JDHC has been renamed UnitedHealthcare Services Company of the River Valley, Inc. On December 20, 2005, the Company acquired PacifiCare. Under the terms of the agreement, PacifiCare shareholders received 1.1 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock and $21.50 in cash for each share of PacifiCare common stock they owned. Total consideration issued for the transaction was approximately $8.8 billion, composed of approximately 99.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock (valued at approximately $5.3 billion based upon the average of UnitedHealth Group’s share closing price for two days before, the day of and two days after the acquisition announcement date of July 6, 2005), approximately $2.1 billion in cash, $960 million in cash paid to retire PacifiCare’s existing debt and UnitedHealth Group vested common stock options with an estimated fair value of approximately $420 million issued in exchange for PacifiCare’s outstanding vested common stock options. On September 19, 2005, our Health Care Services business segment acquired Neighborhood Health Partnership (NHP). Under the terms of the purchase agreement, we paid approximately $185 million in cash in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of NHP. We issued commercial paper to finance the NHP purchase price. On October 16, 2006, we executed a $7.5 billion 364-day revolving credit facility in order to ensure the Company’s immediate and continued access to additional liquidity, if necessary. The credit facility is available for working capital purposes as well as to pay or repay any outstanding borrowings of the Company. We have entered into amendments to this credit facility to provide us with additional time to deliver to the lenders this 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under our $7.5 billion credit facility. In March 2006, we refinanced outstanding commercial paper by issuing $650 million of floating-rate notes due March 2009, $750 million of 5.3% fixed-rate notes due March 2011, $750 million of 5.4% fixed-rate notes due March 2016 and $850 million of 5.8% fixed-rate notes due March 2036. The floating-rate notes due March 2009 are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and had an interest rate of 5.5% at December 31, 2006. In December 2005, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program. We increased the credit facility to $1.3 billion and extended the maturity date to December 2010. We entered into amendments to our $1.3 billion credit facility to provide us with additional time to deliver to the lenders our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, to obtain our lenders’ agreement and acknowledgement that the delivery of a notice of default or notice of acceleration under any indenture or credit agreement that is being contested by the Company in good faith does not cause a default or event of default under the credit agreement, and to obtain a waiver of any potential default that may arise as a result of our determination that our historical financial information should not be relied upon and as a result of 43 Table of Contents our restatement of our historical financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under our $1.3 billion credit facility. In November and December 2005, we issued $2.6 billion of commercial paper primarily to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of the PacifiCare acquisition described above and to retire a portion of the PacifiCare debt at the closing of the acquisition, as well as to refinance current maturities of long-term debt. In October 2005, we executed a $3.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility to support a $3.0 billion increase in our commercial paper program in order to finance the cash portion of the PacifiCare acquisition. We terminated the 364-day revolving credit facility in March 2006. In March 2005, we issued $500 million of 4.9% fixed-rate notes due March 2015. We used the proceeds from this borrowing for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper, capital expenditures, working capital and share repurchases. To more closely align interest costs with the floating interest rate received on our cash and cash equivalent balances, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from a fixed rate to a variable rate. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges. The interest rate swap agreements have aggregate notional amounts of $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2006 with variable rates that are benchmarked to LIBOR, and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate liability, recorded at fair value, for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately $73 million. These fair value hedges are accounted for using the short-cut method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), whereby the hedges are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and the carrying value of the long-term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Since these amounts completely offset, we have reported both the swap liability and the debt liability within debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2006, the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 4.9% to 5.7%. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and long-term debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) below 50%. After giving effect to the credit agreement amendments and waivers that we obtained from our lenders, we believe we are in compliance with the requirements of our debt covenants. On August 28, 2006 we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of our indenture governing our debt securities. This followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. On or about November 2, 2006, we received a purported notice of acceleration from the holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 as a result of our not filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Our indenture requires us to provide to the trustee copies of the reports we are required to file with the SEC, such as our quarterly reports, within 15 days of filing such reports with the SEC. On October 25, 2006, we filed an action in the United States District Federal Court for the District of Minnesota seeking a declaratory judgment that we are not in default under the terms of the indenture. Immediately prior to the filing of this Form 10-K, we filed our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, as well as an amendment to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Should the Company ultimately be unsuccessful in this matter, the Company may be required to retire all or a portion of the $850 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due March 2036. We intend to prosecute the declaratory judgment action vigorously. PacifiCare had approximately $100 million par value of 3% convertible subordinated debentures (convertible notes), which were convertible into approximately 5.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group’s common stock and $102 million of cash as of December 31, 2005. In December 2005, we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected 44 Table of Contents to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture governing the convertible notes. The compensation consisted of the present value of interest through October 18, 2007, the earliest redemption date, plus a pro rata share of $1 million. On January 31, 2006, approximately 91% of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer, for which we issued 4.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, valued at $282 million, and cash of $93 million. Our senior debt is rated “A” with a negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s (S&P), “A” with a negative watch by Fitch, and “A3” with a negative outlook by Moody’s. Our commercial paper is rated “A-1” with a negative outlook by S&P, “F-1” with a negative watch by Fitch, and “P-2” with a negative outlook by Moody’s. Moody’s downgraded our rating in October 2006 citing concerns about corporate governance following the release of the WilmerHale Report (See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We do not expect this Moody’s downgrade to significantly affect our borrowing capacity or costs. A significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs. See “ — Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices — Credit Ratings” for additional information. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. There is no established expiration date for the program. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 40.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $56 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 136.7 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital. The Company suspended purchases under its stock repurchase program in the third quarter of 2006 pending completion of our restatement (which is reflected in this Form 10-K) and becoming current in our periodic SEC filings. The Company intends to resume its stock repurchase program in 2007. We currently have $1.0 billion remaining under our universal S-3 shelf registration statement (for common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and other securities), although we will be unable to issue securities on Form S-3 on a primary basis until we have timely filed all reports required to be filed with the SEC for a twelve-month period. We may offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering. Under our S-4 acquisition shelf registration statement, we have remaining issuing capacity of 48.6 million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities. We filed a separate S-4 registration statement for the 99.2 million shares issued in connection with the December 2005 acquisition of PacifiCare described previously. Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements And Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2006, under our various contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments (in millions): 2007 2008 to 2009 2010 to 2011 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper (1) $ 1,483 $ 1,850 $ 750 $ 3,373 $ 7,456 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper (2) 366 581 438 1,660 3,045 Operating Leases 156 273 167 370 966 Purchase Obligations (3) 182 144 30 5 361 Future Policy Benefits (4) 121 339 325 1,186 1,971 Other Long-Term Obligations (5) — 74 12 325 399 Total Contractual Obligations $ 2,308 $ 3,261 $ 1,722 $ 6,919 $ 14,210 (1) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote. (2) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2006 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. 45 Table of Contents (3) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006. (4) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay (See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The payable is offset by a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica. (5) Includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments. The table above includes a facility lease agreement that we signed in 2006. Lease payments are expected to commence under this agreement in March 2009, at the time we occupy the facility, and extend over a 20 year period with total estimated lease payments of $229 million. In conjunction with the PacifiCare acquisition we committed to make $50 million in charitable contributions to the benefit of California health care consumers, which has been accrued on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we agreed to invest $200 million in California’s health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the California marketplace. The timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion, subject to the advice and oversight of local regulatory authorities; however, our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of 2010. The investment commitment remains in place for 20 years after full funding. We have committed to specific projects totaling $12 million of the $50 million charitable commitment at this time. Due to the financial restatements previously discussed, the Company has determined that certain options exercised by nonexecutive officer employees in 2006 were discount options subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company notified the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on February 28, 2007 that it would participate in the IRS’s resolution program which allows the Company to pay its employees’ additional tax costs under Section 409A. As such, the Company will take a charge, net of tax benefit, of approximately $55 million in the first quarter of 2007. Currently, we do not have any other material contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract Beginning January 1, 2006, the Company began serving as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under a contract with CMS. The Company contracts with CMS on an annual basis. Under Medicare Part D, members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium, typically with an initial annual deductible, coinsurance of 25% for the member and 75% for the Company up to an initial coverage limit of $2,250 of annual drug costs, no insurance coverage between $2,250 and $5,100 (except the member gets the benefit of the Company’s significant drug discounts), and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of $5,100 covered approximately 80% by CMS, 15% by the Company and 5% by the member up to an annual out-of-pocket maximum of $3,600. The Company’s contract with CMS includes risk-sharing provisions, wherein CMS retains approximately 75% to 80% of the losses or profits outside a pre-defined risk corridor. The risk-sharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than 2.5% above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the Company in its initial contract application. 46 Table of Contents During 2006, members were permitted to enroll or disenroll in a Medicare Part D plan until May 15, 2006. Once enrolled, most members were allowed to switch plans once before May 15, 2006 (although low-income members eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid are allowed to change plans monthly). Contracts are generally non-cancelable by enrollees after May 15, 2006. After that date, enrollees may change plans once every year between November 15 and December 31 to take effect January 1 of the following year. As a result of the Medicare Part D benefit design, the Company incurs benefit costs unevenly during the annual contract year. While the Company is responsible for a majority of a Medicare member’s drug costs up to $2,250, the member is responsible for their drug costs from $2,250 up to $5,100 (at the Company’s discounted purchase price). As such, the Company incurs disproportionately higher benefit claims in the first half of the contract year as compared with last half of the contract year, when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the $2,250 initial coverage limit. Although the Company also incurs costs for individuals with annual pharmacy claims in excess of $5,100, these costs represent a much smaller portion of total contract costs, and will be incurred primarily in the second half of the year. The uneven timing of Medicare Part D pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of year that entitle the Company to risk-share adjustment payments from CMS. Accordingly, during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net risk-share receivable from CMS in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in premium revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This represents the estimated amount payable by CMS to the Company under the risk-share contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period. Those losses reverse in the second half of the year and final risk-share amounts due to or from CMS, if any, are settled approximately six months after the contract year-end. The projected net risk-share payable to be paid to CMS as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $350 million. AARP In January 1998, we entered into a ten-year contract with AARP to provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare (Medicare Supplement insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, health insurance focused on persons between 50 to 64 years of age, and other products. Under the terms of this Medicare Supplement insurance contract, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program. Premium revenues from these AARP Supplemental Health Insurance offerings were approximately $5.0 billion in 2006, $4.9 billion in 2005 and $4.5 billion in 2004. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member services expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance at December 31, 2006 is currently sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks associated with the contract. Under a separate license agreement with AARP, we sell Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plans under the AARP brand name. We assume all operational and underwriting risks and losses for these plans. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These standards, among other things, require 47 Table of Contents these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. We maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require. In 2006, based on 2005 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was approximately $2.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company’s regulated subsidiaries paid over $2.5 billion in dividends to their parent companies, including approximately $300 million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators. The inability of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies would impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, the inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt; however, our cash flows from operating activities generated from our non-regulated businesses greatly mitigate this risk. As of December 31, 2006, approximately $1.9 billion of our $20.6 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we have either not yet received or processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical costs incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, care provider contract rate changes, medical care consumption and other medical cost trends. Depending on the health care provider and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can range from two to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. 48 Table of Contents In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by the Company as of the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. We do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors. Accordingly, for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider completion factors in developing medical cost estimates for the most recent months. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2006: Completion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (1) (in millions) (0.75)% $ 126 (0.50)% $ 84 (0.25)% $ 42 0.25% $ (42 ) 0.50% $ (84 ) 0.75% $ (126 ) Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2006: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) in Medical Costs Payable (2) (in millions) 3% $ 247 2% $ 165 1% $ 82 (1)% $ (82 ) (2)% $ (165 ) (3)% $ (247 ) (1) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical cost payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. (2) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in medical costs PMPM trend data used in developing medical cost payable estimates for the most recent three months. 49 Table of Contents The analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on the Company’s historical experience in estimating its liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations (in millions).

(b) Restated to include the impact of FAS 123R, which we adopted effective January 1, 2006, as well as impacts associated with the restatement described in Note 3 “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements.” (c) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (d) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2007 will change as our December 31, 2006 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2007. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of the Company’s liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2006, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the Company’s liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2006; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. The increase in favorable medical cost development in 2006 was driven primarily by growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. As our medical costs payable estimate increases in amount due to increases in the fully insured consumer base and inflationary increases in medical costs, the absolute dollar amount of subsequent changes to that estimate will increase even if the accuracy of our medical costs payable estimate remains consistent as a percentage of the original estimate. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2006 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2006 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $71 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.03 per share. Historic Stock Option Measurement Dates The selection by the Company of the methodologies described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to determine the measurement dates of historic stock option grants involved judgment and careful evaluation of all relevant facts and circumstances for each historical grant. The Company believes it has used the most appropriate methodologies. However, the Company also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustments would have changed under two alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates. The following table sets forth the incremental effect on earnings before income taxes that would result from using the alternate measurement date determination methodologies described below: • Communication Date. This methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which stock option grants were communicated to employees, assuming that the communication date is readily 50 Table of Contents identifiable. This was generally the date on which stock option awards became viewable by all optionees on the Company’s intranet portal for employee benefits. In the event the communication date was not readily available, with respect to Section 16 officers, this alternative methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which a Section 16 officer filed a Form 4 (or other statement of changes in beneficial ownership) with respect to a specific grant and, for employees who are not Section 16 officers, the date on which the Company has determined that the CEO Certificate was likely executed by the former CEO of the Company. • Legal Execution Date. This methodology would select as the measurement date the date on which the Company has determined that the legal documentation approving a grant was likely executed, based on evaluation of all available information. For Section 16 Officers, this date is typically the date on which the Company has determined that the Written Action of the Compensation Committee was likely executed by a majority of the members of the Compensation Committee and, for all other employees, this date is typically the date on which the Company has determined that the CEO Certificate was likely executed by the former CEO of the Company.

We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets As of December 31, 2006, we had long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, equipment and capitalized software, of $20.6 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in 51 Table of Contents circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long-lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Investments As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $10.3 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2006, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $79 million and gross unrealized losses of $53 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary. We analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. See “— Cautionary Statements” for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation. Inflation The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers. Through contracts with physicians and other health care providers, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. 52 Table of Contents Legal Matters Legal Matters Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices Regulatory Inquiries In March 2006, we received an informal inquiry from the SEC relating to our historic stock option practices. On May 17, 2006, we received a document request from the Internal Revenue Service seeking documents relating to stock option grants and other compensation for the persons who from 2003 to the present were the named executive officers in our annual proxy statements. On May 17, 2006, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York requesting documents from 1999 to the present relating to our stock option practices. On June 6, 2006, we received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Minnesota Attorney General requesting documents from January 1, 1997 to the present concerning our executive compensation and stock option practices. After filing an action in Ramsey County Court, State of Minnesota, captioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated vs. State of Minnesota, by Lori Swanson, Attorney General, we filed a Motion for Protective Order which was denied by the trial court. We are pursuing an appeal of the Order denying the Protective Order. On December 19, 2006, we received from the staff of the SEC Enforcement Division a formal order of investigation into the Company’s historic stock option practices. We have also received requests for documents from U.S. Congressional committees relating to our historic stock option practices and compensation of executives. With the exception of the Civil Investigative Demand from the Minnesota Attorney General, we have generally cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the regulatory authorities. At the conclusion of these regulatory inquiries, we could be subject to regulatory or criminal fines or penalties, as well as other sanctions or other contingent liabilities, which could be material. Litigation Matters On March 29, 2006, the first of several shareholder derivative actions was filed against certain of our current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The action has been consolidated with six other actions and is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Shareholder Derivative Litigation. The consolidated amended complaint is brought on behalf of the Company by several pension funds and other shareholders and names certain of our current and former directors and officers as defendants, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The consolidated amended complaint generally alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, were unjustly enriched, and violated the securities laws in connection with our historic stock option practices. The consolidated amended complaint seeks unspecified money damages, injunctive relief and rescission of the options. On June 26, 2006, our Board of Directors created a Special Litigation Committee under Minnesota Statute 302A.241, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, with the power to investigate the claims raised in the derivative actions and a shareholder demand, and determine whether the Company’s rights and remedies should be pursued. Based on the existence of our Special Litigation Committee, defendants have moved to dismiss or in the alternative to stay the litigation pending resolution of the Special Litigation Committee process. A consolidated derivative action, reflecting a consolidation of two actions, is also pending in Hennepin County District Court, State of Minnesota. The consolidated complaint is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Derivative Litigation. The action was brought by two individual shareholders and names certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants, as well as the Company as nominal defendant. On February 6, 2007, the State Court Judge entered an order staying the action pending resolution of the Special Litigation Committee process. On May 5, 2006, the first of seven putative class actions alleging a violation of the federal securities laws was brought by an individual shareholder against certain of our current and former officers and directors in the United 53 Table of Contents States District Court for the District of Minnesota. On December 8, 2006, a consolidated amended complaint was filed consolidating the actions into a single action. The action is captioned In re UnitedHealth Group Incorporated PSLRA Litigation. The action was brought by lead plaintiff California Public Employees Retirement System against the Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that defendants, in connection with the same alleged course of conduct identified in the shareholder derivative actions described above, made misrepresentations and omissions during the period between January 20, 2005 and May 17, 2006, in press releases and public filings that artificially inflated the price of our common stock. The consolidated amended complaint also asserts that during the class period, certain defendants sold shares of our common stock while in possession of material, non-public information concerning the matters set forth in the complaint. The consolidated amended complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b), 14(a), 20(a) and 20A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. The action seeks unspecified money damages and equitable relief. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on February 6, 2007. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. On June 6, 2006, a purported class action captioned Zilhaver v. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, was filed against the Company and certain of our current and former officers and directors in the United State District Court for the District of Minnesota. This action alleges that the fiduciaries to the Company-sponsored 401(k) plan violated ERISA by allowing the plan to continue to hold Company stock. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 6, 2007. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. On August 28, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of our indenture governing our debt securities. This follows our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. On October 25, 2006, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, captioned UnitedHealth Group Incorporated v. Cede & Co. and the Bank of New York, seeking a declaratory judgment that we are not in default under the terms of the indenture. On or about November 2, 2006, we received a purported notice of acceleration from the holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of our 5.80% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 as a result of our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Immediately prior to the filing of this Form 10-K, we filed our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, as well as an amendment to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Should the Company ultimately be unsuccessful in this matter, we may be required to retire all or a portion of the $850 million of Senior Unsecured Notes due March 2036. We intend to vigorously prosecute the declaratory judgment action. Other Legal Matters Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. We record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters. These matters include, but are not limited to, claims relating to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. Beginning in 1999, a series of class action lawsuits were filed against both UnitedHealthcare and PacifiCare, and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business. In December 2000, a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving the Company and our affiliates in the Southern District Court of Florida, Miami division. Generally, the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of ERISA and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits. Other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered. The consolidated suits seek injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. The trial court granted the health care providers’ motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the class action status of the RICO claims, but reversed as to the 54 Table of Contents breach of contract, unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims. During the course of the litigation, there have been co-defendant settlements. On January 31, 2006, the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against PacifiCare, and on June 19, 2006, the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against UnitedHealthcare brought by the lead plaintiff. The tag-along lawsuits remain outstanding. On July 27, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the dismissal of the claims against UnitedHealthcare. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. On March 15, 2000, the American Medical Association filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. On April 13, 2000, we removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The suit alleges causes of action based on ERISA, as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceptive acts and practices, and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non-network providers. The suit seeks declaratory, injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs, fees and interest payments. An amended complaint was filed on August 25, 2000, which alleged two classes of plaintiffs, an ERISA class and a non-ERISA class. After the Court dismissed certain ERISA claims and the claims brought by the American Medical Association, a third amended complaint was filed on January 11, 2002. On October 25, 2002, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint. On May 21, 2003, we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the American Medical Association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff. On May 26, 2004, we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based, in part, due to lack of standing. On July 16, 2004, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, seeking to assert RICO violations. On December 29, 2006, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint. We intend to vigorously defend against the action. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The Company’s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long-term debt. Approximately $20.3 billion of our cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2006 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed-income investment portfolio at December 31, 2006, the fair value of our fixed-income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $337 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long-term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short-term investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $6.1 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately $1.4 billion had fixed rates as of December 31, 2006. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt. At December 31, 2006, we had $312 million of equity investments, a portion of which were held by our UnitedHealth Capital business in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject UnitedHealth Group to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under 55 Table of Contents an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As discussed more fully in Note 5 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our life and annuity business. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2006, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “seeks,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historic Stock Option Practices Matters relating to or arising out of our historic stock option practices, including regulatory inquiries, litigation matters, downgrades in our credit ratings, and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company. As described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 3 “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, in early 2006, our Board of Directors initiated an independent review of the Company’s stock option practices from 1994 to 2005. The independent review was conducted by the Independent Committee with the assistance of independent counsel, WilmerHale, and independent accounting advisors. On October 15, 2006, we announced that the Independent Committee and WilmerHale had completed their review of the Company’s stock option practices and reported the findings to the non-management directors of the Company. As a result of our historic stock option practices, we restated, in this Form 10-K, our previously filed financial statements, we are subject to various regulatory inquiries, litigation matters and credit rating downgrades, and we may be subject to further cash and noncash charges, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 56 Table of Contents Regulatory Inquiries The SEC is conducting a formal investigation into the Company’s historic stock option practices. In May 2006, the Company received a request from the Internal Revenue Service seeking documents relating to stock option grants and other compensation for the persons who from 2003 to the present were named executive officers in the Company’s annual proxy statements. We also received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in May 2006 requesting documents from 1999 to the present relating to the Company’s historic stock option practices. In June 2006, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Minnesota Attorney General requesting documents from January 1, 1997 to the present concerning the Company’s executive compensation and historic stock option practices. We have also received document requests from U.S. Congressional committees in connection with these issues. We have not resolved any of these matters. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will not be subject to adverse publicity, regulatory or criminal fines or penalties, as well as other sanctions or other contingent liabilities or adverse customer reactions in connection with these matters. See Item 7 — “Legal Matters” for a more detailed description of these inquiries and document requests. Litigation Matters We and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in a consolidated federal securities class action, an ERISA class action, and state and federal shareholder derivative actions relating to our historic stock option practices. We also have received several shareholder demands relating to our historic stock option practices. Our Board of Directors has designated an unaffiliated Special Litigation Committee, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, to investigate the claims raised in the derivative actions and shareholder demands, and determine whether the claims should be pursued. In addition, following our announcement that we would delay filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold certain of our debt securities alleging a violation of the indenture governing our debt securities. Subsequently, we filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is not in default under the terms of the indenture. The Company subsequently received a purported notice of acceleration from these holders who previously sent the notice of default that purports to declare an acceleration of the Company’s 5.80% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036, of which an aggregate of $850 million principal amount is outstanding. In connection with the departure of William W. McGuire, M.D., our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we received an order from the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota in November 2006 granting a joint motion for temporary injunctive relief made by plaintiffs and Dr. McGuire. According to the order, Dr. McGuire is preliminarily enjoined from exercising any Company stock options without Court approval, and the Company and Dr. McGuire are preliminarily enjoined from taking any further action pursuant to or having any effect on Dr. McGuire’s employment agreement, as amended, and other related agreements, and while the preliminary injunction is in effect, no payments will be made to Dr. McGuire under these agreements, including any payments under Dr. McGuire’s Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan. These actions are in preliminary stages, and we cannot provide assurance that their ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 7 — “Legal Matters” for a more detailed description of these proceedings and shareholder demands. In addition, we may be subject to additional litigation or other proceedings or actions arising out of the Independent Committee’s review, the Special Litigation Committee’s review and the related restatement of our historical financial statements. Litigation and any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 57 Table of Contents Credit Ratings As a result of their concerns related to our historic stock option practices, Moody’s downgraded our A2 senior debt rating to A3 with a negative outlook in October 2006 and AM Best downgraded our financial strength ratings from A+ to A with a negative outlook in November 2006. Standard & Poor’s and FitchRatings confirmed their existing ratings and their negative outlook (Standard & Poor’s) and negative watch (FitchRatings) on the Company’s ratings. If our business results deteriorate significantly, or if there is an event, outcome or action as a result of the regulatory inquiries and document requests or the pending civil litigation, which is materially adverse to the Company, our credit ratings may be further downgraded. A significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for the Company or limit the Company’s access to capital. Potential Additional Cash and Noncash Charges As described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 3 “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, the Company, after completing its internal review of the accounting treatment of all stock option grants and after consultation with the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant on certain interpretive accounting issues, recorded additional cash and noncash stock-based compensation expenses, and related tax effects, with regard to certain past stock option grants, and restated previously filed financial statements included in this Form 10-K. While we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the financial and tax impacts of our historic stock option practices, we cannot provide assurance that the SEC or the IRS will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial and tax impacts. If the SEC or the IRS disagrees with our financial or tax adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements, we may have to further restate our prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, other adjustments for non-operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option-related matters arising under litigation, and regulatory reviews by the SEC, IRS, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Congressional committees and Minnesota Attorney General, the amount and timing of which are uncertain but which could be material. Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Business We must effectively manage our health care costs. Under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. We base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period; however, medical cost inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for UnitedHealthcare’s commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2006 would have been reduced by approximately $170 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. If these 58 Table of Contents estimates prove too high or too low, the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results. That change can be either positive or negative to our results. We face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate. For our Uniprise and Health Care Services segments, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente and WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit organizations and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas. Our Specialized Care Services and Ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses. The addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or provider arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. Our relationship with AARP is important. Under a ten-year contract with AARP, which commenced in 1998, we provide Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance, health insurance focused on those ages 50 to 64 and other products to AARP members. As of December 31, 2006, this Supplemental Health Insurance program represented approximately $5.0 billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately 3.8 million AARP members. We also have a separate license agreement with AARP to brand certain of our Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The AARP contracts may be terminated by us or AARP at the end of their respective initial terms and may also be terminated early under certain circumstances, including a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the financial condition of either party, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. Some of the effects of changes in Medicare remain uncertain. The changes in Medicare as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are complex and wide-ranging and continue to affect our businesses. We have taken advantage of new opportunities created by the MMA to partner with the federal government, including Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage Regional PPOs, Private Fee for Service Plans and Special Needs Plans for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. We have invested considerable resources in creating new Medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the MMA. Legislative or regulatory changes to these programs could have a significant impact on us. Additionally, our ability to successfully participate in the Medicare Part D program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us, CMS and state governments. The inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our participation in the Medicare Part D program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, pharmaceutical costs and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare Part D program or otherwise, our results could be materially affected. Any positive or negative developments for the Medicare Part D program as a whole are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our Medicare Part D program. 59 Table of Contents We are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. We participate as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid programs and receive revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments. Funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. An unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Our business is subject to routine government scrutiny, and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations. Existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of acquisitions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; and government-sponsored programs. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. We typically are involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These may include routine, regular and special investigations, examinations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys. Such government actions can result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. In addition, public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services. Relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially 60 Table of Contents dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices. In any particular market, these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider. To the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. The nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage, medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by provider groups. See “— Legal Matters” for a more detailed description of our pending litigation matters. The Company is largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks; however, we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims. Although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters. Although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. Our businesses providing PBM services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products. In connection with the PacifiCare merger, we acquired a PBM business, Prescription Solutions. We also provide pharmacy benefits management services through UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions. Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions are subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. While we do not believe that the PBM is a fiduciary, if a court were to determine that our PBM business acts as a fiduciary under ERISA, we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies, preferred drug listings and drug management programs, contracting network practices, specialty drug distribution and other transactions. Our PBM also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our PBM subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. We also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy. 61 Table of Contents Our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care providers, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. The value of our intangible assets may become impaired. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $18.7 billion as of December 31, 2006, representing approximately 40% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. Our knowledge and information-related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services. We must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as this term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. Compliance with these proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. 62 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

731766,UNH,UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Overview UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, serving approximately 70 million Americans. Our focus is on enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. We provide individuals with access to quality, cost-effective health care services and resources. We provide employers and consumers with excellent value, service and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 2007 Financial Performance Highlights UnitedHealth Group had strong results in 2007. The Company achieved growth across each of its reporting segments and generated net earnings of $4.7 billion, representing an increase of 12% over 2006. Other financial performance highlights include: • Diluted net earnings per common share of $3.42, an increase of 15% over 2006. • Consolidated revenues of $75.4 billion, an increase of 5% over 2006. • Earnings from operations of $7.8 billion, up $865 million, or 12%, over 2006. • Operating margin of 10.4%, up from 9.8% in 2006. • Cash flows from operations of $5.9 billion, representing 126% of 2007 net earnings. 2007 Results Compared to 2006 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues are comprised of premium revenues from risk-based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; product revenues; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care services and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependents. For both premium risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care provider services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through our pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, Prescription Solutions, revenues are derived from products sold and from administrative services. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix syndicated content products. 20 Consolidated revenues in 2007 of $75.4 billion increased by $3.9 billion, or 5%, over 2006 driven primarily by rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services. Premium Revenues. Consolidated premium revenues totaled $68.8 billion in 2007, an increase of $3.1 billion, or 5%, over 2006. This increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk-based products. Premium revenues for Commercial Markets (UnitedHealthcare and Uniprise) in 2007 totaled $36.2 billion, an increase of $623 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products in 2007 primarily due to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee-based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2007 totaled $26.0 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7%, over 2006. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. AmeriChoice premium revenues increased by $732 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at OptumHealth, which contributed a premium revenue increase of 11% over 2006. Service Revenues. Consolidated service revenues in 2007 totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $340 million, or 8%, over 2006. This was driven primarily by a 38% increase in Ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. In addition, Commercial Markets service revenues increased due to a 3% increase in the number of individuals served under commercial fee-based arrangements during 2007, as well as annual rate increases. Product Revenues. Consolidated product revenues in 2007 totaled $898 million, an increase of $161 million, or 22%, over 2006. The increase was driven by pharmacy sales growth at Prescription Solutions primarily due to providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members. Investment and Other Income. Investment and other income during 2007 totaled $1.1 billion, representing an increase of $273 million, or 31%, over 2006. Interest income increased by $239 million in 2007, driven by increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments, due in part to deposits held for certain government-sponsored programs during 2007 and the lack of share repurchase activity in the first two and a half months of 2007. Net realized gains on sales of investments were $38 million in 2007 and $4 million in 2006. We expect a slight decline in investment income in 2008 due to the declining interest rate environment in early 2008, as well as a comparatively lower level of invested asset balances expected in 2008. Medical Costs The combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio (medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues). The consolidated medical care ratio decreased from 81.2% in 2006 to 80.6% in 2007. This was primarily due to a decrease in the medical care ratio relating to Ovations which was partially offset by an increase in the commercial medical care ratio resulting from the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment, as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007. 21 For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior fiscal years, resulting from more complete claim information and other facts and circumstances, that are identified in the current year are included in total medical costs reported for the current fiscal year. Medical costs for 2007 included approximately $420 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2006 included approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2007 increased $2.1 billion, or 4%, to $55.4 billion, primarily due to an annual medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk-based business due to medical cost inflation and increased utilization, as well as growth in Ovations Medicare programs, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio (operating costs as a percentage of total revenues) for 2007 of 14.0% was consistent with 2006. The operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, offset by the effect of business mix change as fee-based businesses such as Ingenix increase in size and impact, as well as increased investment in technology, service and product enhancements; incremental marketing and advertising costs for Medicare Advantage products; and expenses in the first quarter of 2007 associated with the application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices, as described below. Operating costs in 2007 totaled $10.6 billion, an increase of $602 million, or 6%, over 2006. This increase was primarily due to general operating cost inflation and was also impacted by the items discussed above. Included in the operating costs for 2007 is $176 million ($112 million net of tax benefit) of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A to our historical stock option practices. As part of our review of the Company’s historical stock option practices, we determined that certain stock options granted to individuals who were nonexecutive officer employees at the time of grant were granted with an exercise price that was lower than the closing price of our common stock on the applicable accounting measurement date, subjecting these individuals to additional tax under Section 409A. The Company elected to pay these individuals for the additional tax costs relating to such stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007. For any outstanding stock options subject to additional tax under Section 409A that were granted to nonexecutive officer employees, the Company increased the exercise price and committed to make cash payments to these optionholders for their vested options based on the difference between the original stock option exercise price and the revised increased stock option exercise price. The payments will be made on a quarterly basis upon vesting of the applicable awards. The first payment of $110 million was made to optionholders in January 2008 for options vested through December 31, 2007. Aggregate future payments will be $38 million, assuming all applicable options vest during 2008 and 2009. If the modified stock options are subsequently exercised, the Company will recover these cash payments at that time from exercise proceeds at the revised increased stock option exercise prices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expense ($55 million net of tax benefit) for the payment of certain optionholders’ tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expense ($57 million net of tax benefit) for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. These amounts have been recorded as corporate expenses and have not been allocated to individual business segments. As previously disclosed, in December 2006, the Company entered into agreements with individuals who were executive officers of the Company at the time of grant of an applicable stock option to increase the exercise price of certain outstanding stock options. No compensation was payable to any of those individuals as a result of the increase in the exercise price of their stock options. 22 Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2007 totaled $768 million, an increase of $169 million, or 28%, over 2006. This was primarily due to costs associated with increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions as a result of providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members in 2007. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2007 was $796 million, an increase of $126 million, or 19%, over 2006. This increase was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006, as well as separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2006. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in both 2007 and 2006. Business Segments During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed the transition to our new segment reporting structure which reflects how our chief operating decision maker now manages our business. Our new reporting structure has four reporting segments: • Health Care Services, which now includes our Commercial Markets (UnitedHealthcare and Uniprise), Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses; • OptumHealth; • Ingenix; and • Prescription Solutions (formerly included in the Ovations business). Historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was revised to reflect our new segment operating and financial reporting structure. The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments for the years ended December 31: (in millions) 2007 2006 PercentChange Revenues Health Care Services $ 71,199 $ 67,817 5% OptumHealth 4,921 4,342 13% Ingenix 1,304 956 36% Prescription Solutions 13,249 4,084 224% Eliminations (15,242 ) (5,657 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 75,431 $ 71,542 5% Earnings from Operations Health Care Services $ 6,595 $ 5,860 13% OptumHealth 895 809 11% Ingenix 266 176 51% Prescription Solutions 269 139 94% Corporate (176 ) — nm Consolidated Earnings From Operations $ 7,849 $ 6,984 12% nm - not meaningful 23 Health Care Services The Health Care Services segment is composed of the Commercial Markets, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. Commercial Markets is comprised of UnitedHealthcare, which offers a comprehensive array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for local, small and mid-sized employers and individuals nationwide, and Uniprise, which provides these services on a dedicated basis to large, multi-site employers. Ovations provides health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older and AmeriChoice provides network-based health and well-being services to state Medicaid programs and the beneficiaries of those programs. The financial results of Commercial Markets, Ovations and AmeriChoice have been aggregated in the Health Care Services segment due to the similar economic characteristics, products and services, types of customers, distribution methods and operational processes, and regulatory environment. These businesses also share significant common assets, including our contracted networks of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology infrastructure and other resources. Health Care Services had revenues of $71.2 billion in 2007, representing an increase of $3.4 billion, or 5%, over 2006. Commercial Markets revenues of $40.3 billion in 2007 increased by $821 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was driven mainly by average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products, an increase in the number of individuals served by commercial fee-based products and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products in 2007 primarily due to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee-based products. Ovations revenues of $26.5 billion in 2007 increased by approximately $1.8 billion, or 7%, over 2006. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. The remaining Health Care Services revenue increase resulted from an increase in AmeriChoice revenues of $750 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2007 were $6.6 billion, representing an increase of $735 million, or 13%, over 2006. This increase was principally driven by a decrease in the medical care ratio for Ovations primarily due to favorable medical cost trends and an increase in the number of individuals served by certain Medicare products and related rate increases discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in individuals served by commercial risk-based products and an increase in the related medical care ratio. The Commercial Markets medical care ratio increased to 82.6% in 2007 from 80.5% in 2006 and the UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 82.1% in 2007 from 79.8% in 2006. These increases were mainly due to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007, which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in December 2006 primarily relating to high-deductible risk-based products. The Health Care Services operating margin for 2007 was 9.3%, an increase from 8.6% in 2006, which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above. 24 The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31: (in thousands) 2007 2006 Commercial Risk-based 10,805 11,285 Commercial Fee-based 14,720 14,415 Total Commercial 25,525 25,700 Medicare Advantage 1,370 1,445 Medicaid 1,710 1,465 Standardized Medicare Supplement 2,400 2,275 Total Public and Senior 5,480 5,185 Total Health Care Services Medical Benefits 31,005 30,885 The number of individuals served with commercial products as of December 31, 2007 decreased by 175,000, or 1%, from the prior year. The number of individuals served with commercial fee-based products as of December 31, 2007 increased by 305,000, or 2%, over 2006 driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products, partially offset by employment attrition at continuing customers. The number of individuals served with commercial risk-based products decreased by 480,000, or 4%, primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and the conversion of individuals to fee-based products. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2007 decreased by 75,000, or 5%, from 2006, primarily due to a decline in participation in private-fee-for-service offerings, while individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement products increased by 125,000, or 5%, due to new customer relationships. Medicaid enrollment increased 245,000, or 17%, in 2007 primarily due to new customer gains, including 180,000 individuals served under the TennCare program in Tennessee. OptumHealth OptumHealth provides health, well-being and financial services to people and organizations nationwide through personalized health advocacy and engagement, specialized benefits such as behavioral, dental and vision offerings, and health-based financial services. OptumHealth revenues of $4.9 billion increased by $579 million, or 13%, over 2006. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. OptumHealth earnings from operations in 2007 of $895 million increased $86 million, or 11%, over 2006 primarily due to the membership growth and rate increases discussed above. The OptumHealth operating margin declined from 18.6% in 2006 to 18.2% in 2007 due to a continued business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by effective operating cost management. Ingenix Ingenix offers solutions to a spectrum of health care market participants on a national and international basis, including data management services, software products, publications, consulting and actuarial services, business process outsourcing services, clinical research outsourcing, pharmaceutical data and consulting services, and revenue cycle management solutions. Ingenix revenues for 2007 of $1.3 billion increased by $348 million, or 36%, over 2006. This was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. Ingenix earnings from operations in 2007 were $266 million, up $90 million, or 51%, from 2006. This increase in earnings from operations was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 and effective operating cost management. The operating margin 25 was 20.4% in 2007, up from 18.4% in 2006. This increase in operating margin was largely driven by business growth and operating cost management described above. Prescription Solutions Prescription Solutions offers a comprehensive array of PBM and specialty pharmacy management services to employer groups, union trusts, seniors through Medicare prescription drug plans, and commercial health plans. Prescription Solutions revenues for 2007 of $13.2 billion increased by $9.2 billion, or 224%, over 2006. This was primarily driven by providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Part D members. Intersegment revenues were eliminated in consolidation and amounted to $12.4 billion and $3.4 billion for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations in 2007 of $269 million increased $130 million, or 94%, from 2006 due largely to the expansion of services to Medicare Part D members discussed above. The operating margin was 2.0% in 2007, a decrease from 3.4% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin reflected the comparatively lower margin earned in the high volume Ovations Medicare Part D prescription drug service contract. 2006 Results Compared to 2005 Results Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues in 2006 of $71.5 billion increased by $25.1 billion, or 54%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, consolidated revenues increased by approximately 21% in 2006 principally driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program on January 1, 2006, rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth in individuals served across our business segments. Following is a discussion of our 2006 consolidated revenue for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues. Consolidated premium revenues totaled $65.7 billion in 2006, an increase of $23.6 billion, or 56%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, consolidated premium revenues increased by $8.8 billion, or 21%, over 2005. The increase was primarily driven by premium rate increases and the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk-based products. Commercial Markets premium revenues in 2006 totaled $35.6 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion, or 27%, over 2005. Excluding premium revenues from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Commercial Markets premium revenues were essentially flat compared to 2005. This was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products, offset by lower premium yields from new business primarily due to a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high-deductible lower-premium products (with correspondingly lower medical costs), and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products primarily due to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee-based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2006 totaled $24.4 billion, an increase of $15.2 billion, or 165%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, Ovations premium revenues increased by approximately $8.3 billion, or 92%, over 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. OptumHealth premium revenues increased by approximately $1.0 billion over 2005. This was primarily due to the acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc. (PacifiCare) and strong growth in the number of individuals served by several OptumHealth businesses under premium-based arrangements. The remaining premium revenue increase primarily resulted from membership growth and premium revenue rate increases in AmeriChoice’s Medicaid programs, which contributed premium revenue increases of approximately $278 million, or 8%, over 2005. 26 Service Revenues. Service revenues in 2006 totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of $602 million, or 16%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, service revenues increased by approximately 12% over 2005. The increase in service revenues was primarily driven by aggregate growth of 8% in the number of individuals served by commercial fee-based arrangements during 2006, as well as annual rate increases. In addition, Ingenix service revenues increased by approximately 22% due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Product Revenues. Product revenues in 2006 totaled $737 million, an increase of $579 million over 2005. This was primarily due to increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Investment and Other Income. Investment and other income during 2006 totaled $871 million, representing an increase of $366 million over 2005. Interest income increased by $372 million in 2006, principally due to the impact of increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments during the year, due in part to the acquisition of PacifiCare, as well as higher yields on fixed-income investments. Net capital gains on sales of investments were $4 million in 2006 and $10 million in 2005. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio increased from 80.0% in 2005 to 81.2% in 2006. This medical care ratio increase resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of PacifiCare and launch of the Medicare Part D program, both of which carry a higher medical care ratio than the historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. Medical costs for 2006 include approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2005 include approximately $400 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2006 increased $19.6 billion, or 58%, to $53.3 billion, due to the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program and a medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk-based business. Medical costs associated with the new Medicare Part D program for 2006 were $4.9 billion. The medical cost trend was due to both medical inflation and increases in health care consumption. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2006 of 14.0%, improved from 15.4% in 2005. This decrease was primarily driven by revenue mix changes, with premium revenues growing at a faster rate than service revenues primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program and the PacifiCare acquisition. Operating costs as a percentage of premium revenues are generally considerably lower than operating costs as a percentage of fee-based revenues. The decrease in the operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration, and an insurance recovery of $43 million. These items were partially offset by a $22 million charitable contribution to the United Health Foundation and approximately $44 million of additional cash expenses related to the stock option review, exclusive of share-based compensation expense. Operating costs in 2006 totaled $10.0 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 40%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, operating costs increased by approximately 13% over 2005. The increase was primarily due to the new Medicare Part D program as well as a 4% increase in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services during 2006 (excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005), growth in OptumHealth and Ingenix, general operating cost inflation, and the specific items discussed above, partially offset by productivity gains from technology deployment, cost savings associated with acquisition integrations and other cost management initiatives. 27 Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold in 2006 totaled $599 million, an increase of $510 million over 2005. This increase was primarily due to increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization in 2006 was $670 million, an increase of $217 million, or 48%, over 2005. Approximately $85 million of this increase was related to intangible assets from PacifiCare and other businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. The remaining increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% in 2006 and in 2005.

Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Health Care Services revenues increased by approximately $8.6 billion, or 20%, over 2005. Commercial Markets revenues of $39.5 billion in 2006 increased by $8.1 billion, or 26%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Commercial Markets revenues increased by approximately 2% over 2005. This was primarily due to an 8% increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee-based products and annual service fee rate increases for self-insured customers, as well as average premium rate increases of approximately 8% or above on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing risk-based products, partially offset by lower premium yields from a larger portion of new customer sales generated from high-deductible lower-premium 28 products and a 5% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products in 2006 primarily due to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee-based products. Ovations revenues of $24.6 billion in 2006 increased by approximately $15.2 billion, or 162%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions since the beginning of 2005, Ovations revenues increased by $7.8 billion, or 85%, over 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the successful launch of the Medicare Part D program, which had premium revenues of $5.7 billion for 2006, and an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare supplement products, as well as rate increases on these products. The remaining increase in Health Care Services revenues is attributable to a 8% increase in AmeriChoice revenues, excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, primarily driven by membership growth and premium revenue rate increases on Medicaid products. Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2006 were $5.9 billion, representing an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over 2005. This increase was principally driven by acquisitions and increases in the number of individuals served by Ovations’ Medicare and Part D products and Commercial Markets’ fee-based products. The segment also benefited by productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, including cost savings associated with the PacifiCare acquisition integration. These initiatives also reduced labor and occupancy costs in the transaction processing and customer service, billing and enrollment functions. The Commercial Markets medical care ratio increased to 80.5% in 2006 from 79.6% in 2005 and the UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 79.8% in 2006 from 78.6% in 2005, mainly due to the impact of the PacifiCare acquisition and changes in product, business and customer mix. Health Care Services’ operating margin for 2006 was 8.6%, a decrease from 9.9% in 2005. This decrease was driven mainly by the acquisition of PacifiCare and the new Medicare Part D program, which have lower operating margins than historic UnitedHealth Group businesses. The following table summarizes the number of individuals served by Health Care Services, by major market segment and funding arrangement, as of December 31: (in thousands) 2006 2005 Commercial Risk-based 11,285 11,350 Commercial Fee-based 14,415 13,240 Total Commercial 25,700 24,590 Medicare Advantage 1,445 1,185 Medicaid 1,465 1,290 Standardized Medicare Supplement 2,275 2,150 Total Public and Senior 5,185 4,625 Total Health Care Services Medical Benefits 30,885 29,215 The number of individuals served by commercial products as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately 1.1 million, or 5%, over the prior year. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, commercial business individuals served increased by 565,000, or 3%, over the prior year. This included an increase of approximately 1.0 million in the number of individuals served with commercial fee-based products, driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products, offset by a decrease of approximately 475,000 in the number of individuals served with commercial risk-based products primarily due to the Company’s internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to fee-based products. Excluding businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, the number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products increased by 230,000 from 2005 primarily due to new customer relationships, while individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement products increased by 125,000, or 6%, due to new 29 customer gains. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, Medicaid enrollment increased 65,000, or 5%, primarily due to new customer gains. OptumHealth OptumHealth revenues of $4.3 billion increased by $1.2 billion, or 39%, over 2005. Excluding the impact of businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005, revenues increased by 20% over the prior period. This increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. Earnings from operations in 2006 of $809 million increased $235 million, or 41%, over 2005. OptumHealth operating margin was 18.6% in 2006, up from 18.4% in 2005. Realized improvements in operating cost structure and benefits from the integration of PacifiCare specialty operations in 2006 were partially offset by a business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products. Ingenix Ingenix revenues for 2006 of $956 million increased by $160 million, or 20%, over 2005. This was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses, as well as businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Earnings from operations in 2006 were $176 million, up $46 million, or 35%, from 2005. Operating margin was 18.4% in 2006, up from 16.3% in 2005. These increases in earnings from operations and operating margin were primarily due to growth in the health information and pharmaceutical services businesses, improving gross margins due to effective cost management, and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2005. Prescription Solutions Results for Prescription Solutions in 2006 included revenues of $4.1 billion, earnings from operations of $139 million and operating margin of 3.4%. The 2005 results included $78 million of revenue and no earnings from operations. The increases in 2006 were primarily due to the timing of the acquisition of this business, which was acquired in December 2005 with the purchase of PacifiCare. Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources Liquidity and Financial Condition We manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. Factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, regulatory limitations, return objectives, tax implications, risk tolerance and maturity dates. Our long-term investments are also available for sale to meet short-term liquidity and other needs. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with the issuance of commercial paper, long-term debt and the 30 availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures, to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions, and to repurchase shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from premiums, fee income and investment income. Any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with estimated future health care costs. In 2007, a hypothetical unexpected 1% increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately $190 million. Change in Capital Structure. On October 31, 2007, we announced that we may increase the debt component of our capital structure to the 40 percent range of debt-to-total-capital. Effective with our debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2007 and share repurchases through year end, the debt component of our capital structure increased to 35.4%. Refer to “— Financing Activities” below for further detail of the debt issuances, including the February 2008 issuance. These events increased our debt-to-total-capital ratio and will reduce our weighted average total cost of capital. This change will also increase our interest expense during 2008, and thereafter as applicable. As a result of this announcement on October 31, 2007, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) downgraded our senior debt rating one notch from “A” to “A-” and our commercial paper rating one notch from “A1” to “A2”. S&P maintained our outlook at stable for both our senior debt and commercial paper. On January 9, 2008, Moody’s downgraded our senior debt rating to “Baa1” and returned our outlook to stable. Moody’s affirmed our commercial paper rating at “P-2” with a stable outlook. On January 30, 2008, Fitch downgraded our senior debt rating to “A-” with a stable outlook and maintained our commercial paper rating at “F-1” with a stable outlook. The interest rates on our debt and commercial paper did not change as a result of the change in debt ratings. We believe the prudent use of debt optimizes our cost of capital and return on shareholders’ equity, while maintaining appropriate liquidity. Operating Activities Net cash flows from operating activities totaled $5.9 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.1 billion for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash from operating activities in 2007 decreased from 2006 by $649 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in working capital cash flows of $1.5 billion partially offset by an increase of $495 million in net income. The decrease in working capital cash flows was driven by lower medical costs payable growth primarily related to Ovations Medicare programs as the 2006 operating cash flows benefited from the initial establishment of the medical costs payable balance related to the Medicare Part D program, fewer income tax refunds received in 2007 as well as larger income tax payments and the timing of certain government payments and receipts. Overall, our receivables and related days sales outstanding increased primarily as a result of these governmental timing differences, while our commercial business receivables remained relatively flat. Investing Activities Net cash flows used for investing activities totaled $4.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For detail on acquisitions, see Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing Activities Net cash flows used for financing activities totaled $3.2 billion for 2007. Net cash flows from financing activities totaled $474 million and $836 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. 31 Debt Transactions. In February 2008, we issued a total of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of floating rate notes due February 2011, $550 million of 4.9% fixed-rate notes due February 2013, $1.1 billion of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due February 2018 and $1.1 billion of 6.9% fixed-rate notes due February 2038. The floating-rate notes are benchmarked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and had an initial interest rate of 4.5%. On the same date, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to receive fixed rates and pay variable rates that are benchmarked to the LIBOR on the February 2013 and February 2018 notes with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $1.7 billion. In November 2007, we issued $500 million of zero coupon notes due November 2022. These zero coupon notes are original issue discount notes with an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of approximately $1.1 billion and an accretion yield of 5.3%. These notes have a put feature that allows a note holder to require us to repurchase the notes at the accreted value at certain annual dates in the future, beginning on November 15, 2010. In November 2007, we issued a total of $1.6 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $250 million of 5.1% fixed-rate notes due November 2010, $450 million of 5.5% fixed-rate notes due November 2012, $250 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due November 2017 and $650 million of 6.6% fixed-rate notes due November 2037. These notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act). In January 2008, we commenced an offer to allow purchasers of the notes to exchange each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the 1933 Act. We expect to complete the exchange in February 2008. In June 2007, we issued a total of $1.5 billion in senior unsecured debt, which included: $500 million of floating-rate notes due June 2010, $500 million of 6.0% fixed-rate notes due June 2017 and $500 million of 6.5% fixed-rate notes due June 2037. The floating-rate notes due June 2010 are benchmarked to the LIBOR and had an interest rate of 5.1% at December 31, 2007. These notes were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. In January 2008, we commenced an offer to allow purchasers of the notes to exchange each series of these notes for a new issue of substantially identical debt securities registered under the 1933 Act. We expect to complete the exchange in February 2008. In March 2006, we issued a total of $3.0 billion in senior unsecured debt to refinance outstanding commercial paper. We issued $650 million of floating-rate notes due March 2009, $750 million of 5.3% fixed-rate notes due March 2011, $750 million of 5.4% fixed-rate notes due March 2016 and $850 million of 5.8% fixed-rate notes due March 2036. The floating-rate notes due March 2009 are benchmarked to the LIBOR and had an interest rate of 5.2% and 5.5% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. PacifiCare had approximately $100 million par value of 3% convertible subordinated debentures (convertible notes) which were convertible into approximately 5.2 million shares of UnitedHealth Group’s common stock and $102 million of cash as of December 31, 2005. In December 2005, we initiated a consent solicitation to all of the holders of outstanding convertible notes pursuant to which we offered to compensate all holders who elected to convert their notes in accordance with existing terms and consent to an amendment to a covenant in the indenture governing the convertible notes. The compensation consisted of the present value of interest through October 18, 2007, the earliest mandatory redemption date, plus a pro rata share of $1 million. On January 31, 2006, approximately $91 million of the convertible notes were tendered pursuant to the offer, for which we issued 4.8 million shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, valued at $282 million, and cash of $93 million and amended the indenture governing these notes. During 2007, approximately $9 million of convertible notes were tendered for conversion, for which we issued 470,119 shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock, valued at approximately $24 million, and cash of approximately $10 million. In September 2007, we notified the remaining holders of our intent to fully redeem all outstanding convertible notes on October 18, 2007, the earliest redemption date. As of October 16, 2007, all convertible notes were tendered pursuant to this redemption notice. Hedging Activities. To more closely align interest costs with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalent and investment balances, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the majority of our interest rate exposure from fixed rates to variable rates. The interest rate swap agreements have aggregate 32 notional amounts of $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, with variable rates that are benchmarked to the LIBOR. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate asset, recorded at fair value, for all existing interest rate swaps was approximately $151 million. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as fair value hedges and are accounted for using the short-cut method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), whereby the hedges are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, and the carrying value of the long-term debt is adjusted for an offsetting amount representing changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Since these amounts completely offset, we have reported both the swap asset and the debt liability within debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and there have been no net gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2007, the rates used to accrue interest expense on these agreements ranged from 4.1% to 6.1%. Stock Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. During 2007, we repurchased 125.3 million shares which were settled for cash on or before December 31, 2007 at an average price of approximately $53 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $6.6 billion. During 2006, we repurchased 40.2 million shares which were settled for cash on or before December 31, 2006 at an average price of approximately $56 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 171.9 million shares of our common stock. Our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock in 2008. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately $11.0 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio was 35.4% and 26.4% as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discounted basis with maturities up to 270 days. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. We believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk. However, a significant downgrade in ratings may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. See “— Cautionary Statements” for additional information. Cash and Investments. We maintained a strong liquidity position, with cash and investments of $22.3 billion and $20.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total cash and investments increased by $1.7 billion since December 31, 2006, primarily due to strong operating cash flows, the issuance of debt, and proceeds received from common stock issuances related to exercises of share-based awards, partially offset by common stock repurchases, repayments of debt, capital expenditures, and funds paid to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Medicare Part D program. As further described under “— Dividend Restrictions,” many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. At December 31, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion of our $22.3 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and common stock repurchases. Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unlimited amount of debt securities. 33 Ratings. Currently, our senior debt is rated “A-” with a stable outlook by S&P, “A-” with a stable outlook by Fitch, and “Baa1” with a stable outlook by Moody’s. Our commercial paper is rated “A2” with a stable outlook by S&P, “F-1” with a stable outlook by Fitch, and “P-2” with a stable outlook by Moody’s. Debt Covenants. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity) below 50%. We were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2007. On August 28, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities. This followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Bank Credit Facilities. In November 2007, we entered into a $1.5 billion 364-day revolving credit facility in order to expand our access to liquidity. The credit facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2007, we had no amounts outstanding under this bank credit facility. In May 2007, we amended and restated our $1.3 billion five-year revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program. We increased the credit facility to $2.6 billion and extended the maturity date to May 2012. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility. In October 2006, we entered into a $7.5 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. Effective August 3, 2007, we elected to reduce the amount of this facility to $1.5 billion. This credit facility expired on October 15, 2007. Dividend Restrictions. We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to standards established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. In 2007 and 2006, based on the previous years’ statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amounts of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval were $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company’s regulated subsidiaries paid approximately $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion in dividends to their parent companies, including approximately $400 million and $300 million of special dividends approved by state insurance regulators, respectively. 34 Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commitments The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2007, under our various contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments: (in millions) 2008 2009 to 2010 2011 to 2012 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper (1) $ 1,946 $ 2,103 $ 1,197 $ 5,763 $ 11,009 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper (2) 484 804 655 4,147 6,090 Operating Leases 173 317 204 345 1,039 Purchase Obligations (3) 204 161 17 — 382 Future Policy Benefits (4) 167 335 327 1,187 2,016 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (5) 4 — — 210 214 Unfunded Investment Commitments (6) 131 221 6 3 361 Other Long-Term Obligations (7) 7 31 — 408 446 Total Contractual Obligations $ 3,116 $ 3,972 $ 2,406 $ 12,063 $ 21,557 (1) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote. (2) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2007 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. (3) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2007. (4) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48). Since the timing of future settlements are uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.” See Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (6) Includes remaining capital commitments for equity investment funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition discussed below. (7) Includes future payments to optionholders related to the application of Section 409A, as well as obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition discussed below, which have been classified as “Thereafter” due to uncertainty regarding payment timing. The table above includes a facility lease agreement that we signed in 2006. Lease payments are expected to commence under this agreement in March 2009, at the time we occupy the facility, and extend over a 20-year period with total estimated lease payments of $229 million. In conjunction with the PacifiCare acquisition we committed to make $50 million in charitable contributions for the benefit of California health care consumers, which has been accrued in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have committed to specific projects totaling approximately $18 million of the $50 million charitable commitment at December 31, 2007, of which $6 million was paid. Additionally, we agreed to invest $200 million in 35 California’s health care infrastructure to further health care services to the underserved populations of the California marketplace, of which $8 million was invested at December 31, 2007. The timing and amount of individual contributions and investments are at our discretion subject to the advice and oversight of the local regulatory authorities; however, our goal is to have the investment commitment fully funded by the end of 2010. The investment commitment remains in place for 20 years after funding. The unfunded charitable commitment and investment commitment have been included in the above table. At December 31, 2007, we had pending cash acquisitions. See Note 4 of Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. We do not have any other material contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. Medicare Part D Pharmacy Benefits Contract Beginning January 1, 2006, the Company began serving as a plan sponsor offering Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance coverage under contracts with CMS. The Company contracts with CMS on an annual basis. Under Medicare Part D, members have access to a standard drug benefit that features a monthly premium, typically with an initial annual deductible, coinsurance of 25% for the member and 75% for the Company up to an initial coverage limit of $2,400 of annual drug costs, no insurance coverage between $2,400 and $5,451 (except the member gets the benefit of the Company’s significant drug discounts), and catastrophic coverage for annual drug costs in excess of $5,451 covered approximately 80% by CMS, 15% by the Company and 5% by the member up to an annual out-of-pocket maximum of $3,850. The Company’s contract with CMS includes risk-sharing provisions, wherein CMS retains approximately 75% to 80% of the losses or profits outside a pre-defined risk corridor. The risk-sharing provisions take effect if actual pharmacy benefit costs are more than 2.5% above or below expected cost levels as submitted by the Company in its initial contract application. Contracts are generally non-cancelable by enrollees; however, enrollees may change plans during an annual enrollment period each year. As a result of the Medicare Part D product benefit design, the Company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs early in the contract year. While the Company is responsible for approximately 67% of a Medicare Part D beneficiary’s drug costs up to $2,400, the beneficiary is responsible for 100% of their drug costs from $2,400 up to $5,451 (at the Company’s discounted purchase price). Consequently, the Company incurs a disproportionate amount of pharmacy benefit costs in the first half of the contract year as compared with the last half of the contract year, when comparatively more members will be incurring claims above the $2,400 initial coverage limit. The uneven timing of Medicare Part D pharmacy benefit claims results in losses in the first half of the year that entitle the Company to risk-share adjustment payments from CMS. Accordingly, during the interim periods within the contract year we record a net risk-share receivable from CMS in Other Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a corresponding retrospective premium adjustment in Premium Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This represents the estimated amount payable by CMS to the Company under the risk-share contract provisions if the program were terminated based on estimated costs incurred through that interim period. Those losses are typically expected to reverse in the second half of the year. Total premium revenues from CMS related to the Medicare Part D program and all other Medicare-related programs were approximately 25% of our total consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007. As of January 1, 2008, certain changes were made to the Medicare Part D coverage by CMS, including: • The initial coverage limit increased to $2,510. • The catastrophic coverage begins at $5,726. 36 • The annual out-of-pocket maximum increased to $4,050. • The risk-share provisions take effect if actual costs are more than 5% above or below expected costs. • CMS retains 50% to 80% of the losses or profits outside this risk corridor. These changes result in an increase in the amount of losses or profits that we may realize from this contract in 2008 as the amount of risk retained by CMS has diminished. AARP We provide health insurance products and services to members of AARP. These products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional Medicare (AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance), hospital indemnity insurance, health insurance focused on persons between 50 to 64 years of age, and other products (Supplemental Health Insurance Program). Under the Supplemental Health Insurance Program, we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk. We are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings. Premium revenues from our portion of the AARP Supplemental Health Insurance Program were approximately $5.3 billion in 2007, $5.0 billion in 2006 and $4.9 billion in 2005. The underwriting gains or losses related to the AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund (RSF). The primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue, medical costs, investment income, administrative expenses, member service expenses, marketing expenses and premium taxes. Underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the RSF and accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders, unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the RSF. To the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the RSF, we would have to fund the deficit. Any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract. To date, we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits. As further described in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the RSF balance is reported in Other Policy Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the RSF balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting and other risks and liabilities associated with the contract. Under separate trademark license agreements with AARP, we sell AARP-branded Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plans and Medicare Advantage plans. We pay AARP a license fee for the use of the trademark and member data and assume all operational and underwriting risks. On October 3, 2007, we entered into new agreements with AARP which amended our existing arrangements. See Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe our critical accounting policies are those described below. For a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 37 not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us as of the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. We do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors. Accordingly, for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control, as well as through a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2007: Completion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (1) (in millions) (0.75)% $ 135 (0.50)% $ 90 (0.25)% $ 45 0.25% $ (45 ) 0.50% $ (90 ) 0.75% $ (135 ) 38 Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical costs payable for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2007: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factor Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (2) (in millions) 3% $ 258 2% $ 172 1% $ 86 (1)% $ (86 ) (2)% $ (172 ) (3)% $ (258 ) (1) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical cost payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. (2) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical costs and medical costs payable caused by changes in medical costs PMPM trend data used in developing medical cost payable estimates for the most recent three months. The analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience in estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations: FavorableDevelopment Increase (Decrease)to Medical Costs (a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations (in millions) As Reported As Adjusted (b) As Reported As Adjusted (b) 2005 $ 400 $ (30 ) $ 33,669 $ 33,639 $ 5,080 $ 5,110 2006 $ 430 $ 10 $ 53,308 $ 53,318 $ 6,984 $ 6,974 2007 $ 420 (c ) $ 55,435 (c ) $ 7,849 (c ) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year. (b) Represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development. (c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2008 will change as our December 31, 2007 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2008. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2007, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2007; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2007 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding the AARP business, 2007 earnings from operations would increase or decrease by $72 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.03 per share. 39 Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets As of December 31, 2007, we had long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and property, equipment and capitalized software, of $20.7 billion. We review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long-lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. Investments As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $13.4 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2007, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $182 million and gross unrealized losses of $27 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other than temporary. We analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular 40 quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. See “— Cautionary Statements” for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation. Legal Matters A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein. Concentrations of Credit Risk Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2007, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. As of December 31, 2007, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. Cautionary Statements The statements, estimates, projections, guidance or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “seeks,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider. Except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws, we do not undertake to address or update forward-looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results, and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in any other public filings or statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in this report or any of our prior communications. 41 Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Historical Stock Option Practices Matters relating to or arising out of our historical stock option practices, including regulatory inquiries, litigation matters, and potential additional cash and noncash charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In early 2006, our Board of Directors initiated an independent review of the Company’s historical stock option practices from 1994 to 2005. The independent review was conducted by an independent committee comprised of three independent directors of the Company (Independent Committee) with the assistance of independent counsel and independent accounting advisors. On October 15, 2006, we announced that the Independent Committee had completed their review of the Company’s historical stock option practices and reported the findings to the non-management directors of the Company. As a result of our historical stock option practices, we restated our previously filed financial statements, we are subject to various regulatory inquiries and litigation matters, and we may be subject to further cash and noncash charges, the outcome of any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Regulatory Inquiries As previously disclosed, the SEC and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York are conducting investigations into the Company’s historical stock option practices and the Company has received requests for documents from the Minnesota Attorney General and various Congressional committees in connection with these issues and the Company’s executive compensation practices. We have not resolved these matters. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will not be subject to adverse publicity, regulatory or criminal fines, penalties, or other sanctions or contingent liabilities or adverse customer reactions in connection with these matters. In addition, we may be subject to additional regulatory inquiries arising out of the review of the Independent Committee, the review of a special litigation committee, consisting of two former Minnesota Supreme Court Justices, appointed by our Board of Directors to review claims asserted in federal and state shareholder derivative claims relating to our historical stock option practices (Special Litigation Committee), and the related restatement of our historical financial statements. Regulatory inquiries may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any regulatory inquiry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation Matters We and certain of our current and former directors and officers are defendants in a consolidated federal securities class action, an Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) class action, and state and federal shareholder derivative actions relating to our historical stock option practices. We also have received shareholder demands relating to those practices. In addition, following our announcement that we would delay filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities. We cannot provide assurance that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings and shareholder demands. In addition, we may be subject to additional litigation, proceedings or actions arising out of the Independent Committee’s review, the Special Litigation Committee’s review and the related restatement of our historical financial statements. Litigation regulatory proceedings or actions may be time consuming, expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business. The adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit or any potential regulatory proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 42 Potential Additional Cash and Noncash Charges While we believe we have made appropriate judgments in our restated financial statements in determining the financial impacts of our historical stock option practices, we cannot provide assurance that the SEC will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported, or not reported, the financial impacts, including the adjustments that we made based on our determination of the measurement dates for our historical stock option grants. If the SEC disagrees with our financial adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements, we may have to further restate our prior financial statements, amend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated. In addition, other adjustments for non-operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option-related matters arising under litigation and the above-referenced regulatory reviews, the amount and timing of which are uncertain but which could be material. Cautionary Statements Relating to Our Business If we fail to effectively estimate and manage our health care costs, the profitability of our risk-based products could decline and could materially adversely affect our future financial results. Under our risk-based product arrangements, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise approximately 90% of our total consolidated revenues. We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers. The profitability of our risk-based products depends in large part on our ability to predict, price for, and effectively manage health care costs. Total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service. Our premium revenue on commercial policies is typically fixed for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June the year before the contract year. We base the premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed contract period; however, medical cost inflation, regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, catastrophes, epidemics, the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology, new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use. As a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results, relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if medical costs increased by 1% without a proportional change in related revenues for commercial insured products, our annual net earnings for 2007 would have been reduced by approximately $190 million. In addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding. If these estimates prove too low, they will have a negative impact on our future results. If we fail to comply with or fail to respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in federal and state regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our business is regulated at the federal, state, local and international levels. The laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. The broad latitude that is given to the agencies administering those regulations, as well as future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements, and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations, contract interpretation and other actions. We must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products, to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions, including integration of certain acquisitions. Delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs. 43 We participate in federal, state and local government health care coverage programs. These programs generally are subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs. Such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past, and may do so in the future. State legislatures and Congress continue to focus on health care issues. Legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business, including contracting with physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals; physician reimbursement methods and payment rates; coverage determinations; mandated benefits and minimum medical expenditures; claim payments and processing; drug utilization and patient safety efforts; use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information; medical malpractice litigation; consumer-driven health plans and health savings accounts and insurance market reforms; confidentiality of health information; and government-sponsored programs. For example, from time to time, Congress has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA. Additionally, there have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations. We cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be, but their enactment could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, the health care industry is subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by: adversely affecting our ability to market our products and services; requiring us to change our products and services; or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate. In August 2007, we entered into a multi-state national agreement with regulatory offices in 38 states relating to the legacy UnitedHealthcare fully insured commercial business. The agreement covers several key areas of review of our business operations, including claims payment accuracy and timeliness, appeals and grievances resolution timeliness, health care professional network/service, utilization review, explanation of benefits accuracy, and oversight and due diligence of contracted entities and vendor performance. The agreement addressed and resolved past regulatory matters related to the areas of review prior to August 2007 and establishes a transparent framework for evaluating and regulating performance through December 2010. On a prospective basis, the agreement is similar to a customer performance guarantee, whereby we will self report quarterly and annually our operational performance on a set of national performance standards agreed to by the participating states. We must perform to the standards set forth in the agreement, or be subject to fines and penalties. We are also involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These regulatory activities include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys, the SEC and other governmental authorities. Reviews and investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs. For example, in 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care and the California Department of Insurance examined our PacifiCare health plans in California. As a result of these examinations, the California Department of Managed Health Care has assessed a penalty of $3.5 million related to its findings. The California Department of Insurance, however, has not yet levied a financial penalty related to its findings. In addition, public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price, damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services. 44 Our business providing PBM services are subject to federal and state regulations associated with the PBM industry and if we fail to comply with these regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In connection with the PacifiCare merger, we acquired a PBM business, Prescription Solutions. We also provide PBM services through UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions. Prescription Solutions and UnitedHealth Pharmaceutical Solutions are subject to federal and state anti-kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies. In the event a court were to determine that our PBM business acts as a fiduciary under ERISA, we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies, preferred drug listings and drug management programs, contracting network practices, specialty drug distribution and other transactions. Our PBM business also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our PBM subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties. We also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy, including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. If we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share, including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our businesses compete throughout the United States and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate. For our Health Care Services segment, competitors include Aetna Inc., Cigna Corporation, Coventry Health Care, Inc., Health Net, Inc., Humana Inc., Kaiser Permanente, WellPoint, Inc., numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as Medicare specialty services. For our Prescription Solutions business, competitors include Medco Health Solutions, Inc., CVS/Caremark Corporation and Express Scripts, Inc. Our OptumHealth and Ingenix business segments also compete with a number of other businesses. The addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. In particular markets, competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage. Greater market share, established reputation, superior supplier or health care professional arrangements, existing business relationships, and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors. In addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate, both as to our competitors and suppliers (including hospitals, physician groups and other care professionals) in these industries. Consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers, to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers, or to maintain or advance profitability. If we do not complete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets, if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A reduction or less than expected increase in Medicare and Medicaid program funding and/or our failure to retain and acquire Medicare, Medicaid and State Medicaid Children’s Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP) enrollees could adversely affect our revenues and financial results. We participate as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and various Medicaid and SCHIP programs and receive revenues from the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP programs to provide benefits under these programs. Our participation in these programs is through bids that are submitted periodically. Revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these programs is dependent upon 45 many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities. A reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Our ability to retain and acquire Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP enrollees is impacted by bids and plan designs submitted by us and our competitors. Under the Medicaid Managed Care program, state Medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid Managed Care contracts, we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those Medicaid plans. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold, which is set by the government after our bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. For example, we lost approximately 650,000 of our auto-enrolled low-income subsidy members in 2008 because our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, and other factors. In the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect or our competitors’ bids and positioning are different than anticipated, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the Medicare program or otherwise, our financial results could be materially affected. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other health care providers for competitive prices and services. Our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services. In any particular market, these physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In addition, we have capitation arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Under the typical arrangement, the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member. Under some capitated arrangements, the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional. To the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. There can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. 46 If we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality, our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected. The use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA). HIPAA also requires that we impose privacy and security requirements on our business associates (as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations). Even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Compliance with any privacy proposals, requirements, and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, the development of new administrative processes, and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates. They also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases. Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. Our relationship with AARP is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under our agreements with AARP, we provide AARP-branded Medicare Supplement insurance, hospital indemnity insurance and other products to AARP members and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to AARP members and non-members. One of our agreements with AARP expands the relationship to include AARP-branded Medicare Advantage plans for AARP members and non-members. Our agreements with AARP contain commitments regarding corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers. The AARP agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances, including, depending on the agreement, a material breach by either party, insolvency of either party, a material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company, material changes in the Medicare programs, material harm to AARP caused by the Company, and by mutual agreement. The success of our AARP arrangements depends, in part, on our ability to service AARP and its members, develop additional products and services, price the products and services competitively, meet our corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, and diversity commitments, and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes. The loss of our AARP relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because of the nature of our business, we are routinely subject to various litigation actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. Periodically, we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, shareholder suits, and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings. These matters include, among others, claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment (including disputes with enrollees, customers, and contracted and non-contracted physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals), medical malpractice actions, contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices. We are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups. 47 We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks. Although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self-insurance, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages in some circumstances, are not covered by insurance. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters, however, it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, to provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of technology initiatives, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been taking steps to consolidate the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and changing customer patterns. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences. In addition, failure to consolidate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows. Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. If the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations, shareholders’ equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected. Due largely to our recent acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, representing approximately 37% of our total assets. If we make additional acquisitions, it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants. 48 Our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ Departments of Insurance. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. The levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated. A significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our operations or financial position may be adversely affected. Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers. Our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders. Downgrades in our ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects. As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially adversely affect our financial results. Fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could impair our profitability and capital position. Volatility in interest rates affects our returns on, and the market value of, fixed income and short term investments, which comprise the majority of the fair value of our investments at December 31, 2007. In addition, defaults by issuers, primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds, who fail to pay or perform on their obligations could reduce our investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses as we may be required to write down the value of our investments, which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders’ equity. We also invest a smaller proportion of our investments in equity investments, which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses. 49 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices. The Company’s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long-term debt. Approximately $13.0 billion of our investments at December 31, 2007 were debt securities. Assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed-income investment portfolio at December 31, 2007, the fair value of our fixed-income investments would decrease or increase by approximately $460 million. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. To mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely align the fixed interest rates of our long-term debt with the variable rates of our cash equivalents and short-term investments. Including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, approximately $8.2 billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and $2.8 billion had fixed rates as of December 31, 2007. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of our debt by approximately $330 million. At December 31, 2007, we had $383 million of equity investments, a portion of which were held in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio. 50",2023-12-30 16:29:01.213816

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto. Readers should be cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” BUSINESS OVERVIEW UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, serving more than 70 million Americans. Our focus is on enhancing the performance of the health system and improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. We provide individuals with access to quality, cost-effective health care services and resources. We provide employers and consumers with excellent value, service and support, and we deliver value to our shareholders by executing a business strategy founded upon a commitment to balanced growth, profitability and capital discipline. BUSINESS TRENDS Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 16% of gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. Management expects overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, based on inflation, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of growth may be impacted by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and proposed health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Adverse Economic Conditions The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for certain of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers and will pressure top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare business. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business has seen increased participation in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. In total, management believes that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability. Management also believes that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how a prolonged economic downturn could affect our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Proposed Federal Economic Stimulus Package In the short term, our businesses may benefit if proposed elements of the federal economic stimulus package responding to the current recession are signed into law. These include expansion of funding to state programs, 31 Table of Contents which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, expansion of coverage for recently unemployed workers through their former employers’ plans, which could enhance participation in UnitedHealthcare benefit programs, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix. Proposed Health Care Reforms There is regular dialogue about health care reforms at both state and national levels, due to the size of and national interest in the health economy. Examples of these health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, such as having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system or a fundamental restructuring of the Medicare or Medicaid programs. The new administration and various congressional leaders have signaled their interest in reducing payments to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Depending on the extent and phasing of these potential reductions, management believes that the number of seniors participating in Medicare Advantage and the industry-wide earnings derived from these plans may fall. However, if payment rates do come down, management believes that there are a number of adjustments we can make to our operations annually, which may partially offset any earnings impact. For example, we can adjust members’ benefits, we can decide on a county-by-county basis which geographies to participate in, and we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management. Any payment reductions may be phased in over a number of years. If industry-wide Medicare Advantage membership reduces, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is also a market leader. We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for various of our products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid- to long-term time horizon. For additional discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 2008 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY We generated net earnings of $3.0 billion, representing a decrease of 36% compared to 2007. Other financial performance measures include: • Diluted net earnings per common share of $2.40, a decrease of 30% compared to 2007. • Consolidated revenues of $81.2 billion, an increase of 8% over 2007. • Earnings from operations of $5.3 billion, down $2.6 billion over 2007. • The operating margin of 6.5%, down from 10.4% in 2007. • Cash flows from operations of $4.2 billion, representing 142% of 2008 net earnings. 32 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following summarizes the consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31: (in millions, except percentages and pershare data) Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 REVENUES Premiums $ 73,608 $ 68,781 $ 65,666 $ 4,827 7 % $ 3,115 5 % Services 5,152 4,608 4,268 544 12 % 340 8 % Products 1,655 898 737 757 84 % 161 22 % Investment and Other Income 771 1,144 871 (373 ) (33 ) % 273 31 % Total Revenues 81,186 75,431 71,542 5,755 8 % 3,889 5 % OPERATING COSTS Medical Costs 60,359 55,435 53,308 4,924 9 % 2,127 4 % Medical Cost Ratio 82.0 % 80.6 % 81.2 % 1.4 % (0.6 ) % Operating Costs 13,103 10,583 9,981 2,520 24 % 602 6 % Operating Cost Ratio 16.1 % 14.0 % 14.0 % 2.1 % — % Cost of Products Sold 1,480 768 599 712 93 % 169 28 % Depreciation and Amortization 981 796 670 185 23 % 126 19 % Total Operating Costs 75,923 67,582 64,558 8,341 12 % 3,024 5 % EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS 5,263 7,849 6,984 (2,586 ) (33 ) % 865 12 % Operating Margin 6.5 % 10.4 % 9.8 % (3.9 ) % 0.6 % Interest Expense (639 ) (544 ) (456 ) 95 17 % 88 19 % EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 4,624 7,305 6,528 (2,681 ) (37 ) % 777 12 % Provision for Income Taxes (1,647 ) (2,651 ) (2,369 ) (1,004 ) (38 ) % 282 12 % Tax Rate 35.6 % 36.3 % 36.3 % (0.7 ) % — % NET EARNINGS $ 2,977 $ 4,654 $ 4,159 $ (1,677 ) (36 ) % $ 495 12 % DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 2.40 $ 3.42 $ 2.97 $ (1.02 ) (30 ) % $ 0.45 15 % RETURN ON EQUITY 14.9 % 22.4 % 22.2 % (7.5 ) % 0.2 % TOTAL PEOPLE SERVED 73 71 71 2 3 % — — % ACQUISITIONS Unison Health Plans. On May 30, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Unison Health Plans (Unison) for approximately $930 million in cash. Unison provides government-sponsored health plan coverage to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee, Delaware, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. through a network of independent health care professionals. This acquisition strengthened our resources and capabilities in these areas. The results of operations and financial condition of Unison have been included in our consolidated results and the results of our Health Care Services reporting segment since the acquisition date. Sierra Health Services, Inc. On February 25, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra), a diversified health care services company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, for approximately $2.6 billion in cash, representing a price of $43.50 per share of Sierra common stock. This acquisition strengthened our position in the southwest region of the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition conditioned upon the divestiture of our individual SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada, which represented approximately 30,000 members. The divestiture was completed on April 30, 2008. We received proceeds of $185 million for this transaction which were recorded as a reduction to Operating Costs. Group SecureHorizons Medicare Advantage plans offered through commercial 33 Table of Contents contracts were excluded from the divestiture. Also, we retained Sierra’s Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Nevada. The results of operations and financial condition of Sierra have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Care Services, OptumHealth and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. Fiserv Health, Inc. On January 10, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fiserv Health, Inc. (Fiserv Health), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., for approximately $740 million in cash. Fiserv Health is a leading administrator of medical benefits and also provides care facilitation services, specialty health solutions and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. This transaction allows us to expand the capacity of our existing benefits administration businesses and enables existing and new customers to leverage our full range of assets, including ancillary services, our national network and technology tools. The results of operations and financial condition of Fiserv Health have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Care Services, OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. 2008 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Revenues consist of premium revenues from risk-based products; service revenues, which primarily include fees for management, administrative and consulting services; product revenues; and investment and other income. Premium revenues are primarily derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs. Service revenues consist primarily of fees derived from services performed for customers that self-insure the medical costs of their employees and their dependants. For both premium risk-based and fee-based customer arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. Through our Prescription Solutions PBM business, revenues are derived from both products sold and administrative services. Product revenues also include sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. Consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the Health Care Services reporting segment. The following is a discussion of consolidated revenues for each of our revenue components. Premium Revenues. The premium revenue growth generated by our Health Care Services reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase. This increase was due to the growth in individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk-based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Service Revenues. The increase in service revenues for 2008 was driven by an increased number of individuals served by fee-based product arrangements in the Health Care Services reporting segment, primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition. In addition, our Ingenix reporting segment generated service revenue growth from its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. Product Revenues. Product revenues for 2008 increased due to increased prescription volume at our Prescription Solutions reporting segment, primarily related to the Fiserv Health acquisition. 34 Table of Contents Investment and Other Income. The decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily as a result of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents, decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows, decreased deposits held for certain government-sponsored programs and increased other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation, acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in Ovations Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk-based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. The medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. Our consolidated medical care ratio increase was primarily driven by premium rates advancing more slowly than medical costs in 2008 for certain risk-based products in the commercial, senior and behavioral care markets. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. Medical costs for 2008 included approximately $230 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2007 included approximately $420 million of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as discussed below, acquisitions completed in 2008, costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee-based businesses. Operating costs for 2008 include $882 million for the proposed settlements of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, net of expected insurance proceeds, and $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in expenses for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership of our individual Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada relating to the Sierra acquisition. These amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment. For a discussion of the proposed settlements, see Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating costs for 2007 include $176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders’ tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. These amounts have been recorded in the corporate segment. For an expanded discussion of our Section 409A charges, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased due to increased prescription volume at our Prescription Solutions reporting segment, primarily related to the Fiserv Health acquisition. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements, as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to recent business acquisitions. Interest Expense Interest expense increased due to an increase in our debt outstanding, which was partially offset by lower market interest rates on our floating-rate debt. Income Taxes The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax-free investment income to total earnings. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: • Health Care Services, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice; • OptumHealth; • Ingenix; and • Prescription Solutions. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Care Services customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Care Services customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Care Services by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 36 Table of Contents The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments for the years ended December 31: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Revenues Health Care Services $ 75,857 $ 71,199 $ 67,817 $ 4,658 7 % $ 3,382 5 % OptumHealth 5,225 4,921 4,342 304 6 % 579 13 % Ingenix 1,552 1,304 956 248 19 % 348 36 % Prescription Solutions 12,573 13,249 4,084 (676 ) (5 )% 9,165 224 % Eliminations (14,021 ) (15,242 ) (5,657 ) 1,221 nm (9,585 ) nm Consolidated Revenues $ 81,186 $ 75,431 $ 71,542 $ 5,755 8 % $ 3,889 5 % Earnings from Operations Health Care Services $ 5,068 $ 6,595 $ 5,860 $ (1,527 ) (23 )% $ 735 13 % OptumHealth 718 895 809 (177 ) (20 )% 86 11 % Ingenix 229 266 176 (37 ) (14 )% 90 51 % Prescription Solutions 363 269 139 94 35 % 130 94 % Corporate (1,115 ) (176 ) — (939 ) nm (176 ) nm Consolidated Earnings from Operations $ 5,263 $ 7,849 $ 6,984 $ (2,586 ) (33 )% $ 865 12 % Operating Margin Health Care Services 6.7 % 9.3 % 8.6 % (2.6 )% 0.7 % OptumHealth 13.7 % 18.2 % 18.6 % (4.5 )% (0.4 )% Ingenix 14.8 % 20.4 % 18.4 % (5.6 )% 2.0 % Prescription Solutions 2.9 % 2.0 % 3.4 % 0.9 % (1.4 )% Consolidated Operating Margin 6.5 % 10.4 % 9.8 % (3.9 )% 0.6 % nm = not meaningful Health Care Services The revenue growth in Health Care Services for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of Sierra, Fiserv Health, and Unison, partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial risk-based products and Medicare Part D products and a decrease in investment income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $41.8 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 4%. The UnitedHealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for Health Care Services in 2008. Ovations revenues of $28.1 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products gained through both organic growth and the Sierra acquisition and premium rate increases, which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675,000 stand-alone Medicare Part D members primarily due to the reassignment by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of certain dual-eligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $6.0 billion in 2008, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans, premium rate increases and the acquisition of Unison in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in Health Care Services earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the UnitedHealthcare risk-based business and pressure on gross margins in Medicare Part D 37 Table of Contents prescription drug plans, partially offset by acquisitions. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 83.5% in 2008 from 82.6% in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases, net of customer benefit package changes, did not fully match the rise in medical costs, and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business, which typically carries a higher medical care ratio. Health Care Services’ operating margin was 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease from 9.3% in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above. The following summarizes the number of individuals served, by major market segment and funding arrangement, at December 31: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Commercial Risk-based 10,360 10,805 11,285 (445 ) (4 )% (480 ) (4 )% Commercial Fee-based 15,985 14,720 14,415 1,265 9 % 305 2 % Total Commercial 26,345 25,525 25,700 820 3 % (175 ) (1 )% Medicare Advantage 1,495 1,370 1,445 125 9 % (75 ) (5 )% Medicaid 2,515 1,710 1,465 805 47 % 245 17 % Standardized Medicare Supplement 2,540 2,400 2,275 140 6 % 125 5 % Total Public and Senior 6,550 5,480 5,185 1,070 20 % 295 6 % Total Health Care Services Medical Benefits 32,895 31,005 30,885 1,890 6 % 120 — % The number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions, which included the addition of 1,315,000 fee-based members from Fiserv Health and the addition of 310,000 risk-based individuals gained through the Sierra acquisition. These additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805,000, or 3%, from December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial risk-based products and the impact of a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products at December 31, 2008 increased through the addition of 60,000 seniors from our acquisition of Sierra and organic growth of 95,000 seniors, partially offset by the divestiture of 30,000 individuals in Nevada related to the Sierra acquisition. Medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320,000 and 60,000 individuals from our Unison and Sierra acquisitions, respectively, and strong organic growth of 425,000 individuals. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment. OptumHealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 1 million individuals year-over-year. Earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for risk-based behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business. Ingenix The improvement in Ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. The decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects which were cancelled, as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment. Prescription Solutions The decreased Prescription Solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dual-eligible beneficiaries described above through Medicare Part D 38 Table of Contents prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment, and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization, partially offset by revenues related to the Fiserv Health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $11.0 billion and $12.4 billion for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition, gains in mail service drug fulfillment, and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. 2007 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2006 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues increased in 2007 primarily due to rate increases on premium-based and fee-based services and growth in the total number of individuals served by Health Care Services. Premium Revenues. Consolidated premium revenues increased in 2007 primarily due to premium rate increases, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by our commercial risk-based products. Premium revenues for UnitedHealthcare in 2007 totaled $36.2 billion, an increase of $623 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was primarily due to average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products and due to premiums from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products in 2007 primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee-based products. Ovations premium revenues in 2007 totaled $26.0 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 7%, over 2006. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare Supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. AmeriChoice premium revenues increased by $732 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. The remaining premium revenue increase resulted primarily from membership growth and rate increases at OptumHealth, which contributed a premium revenue increase of 11% over 2006. Service Revenues. The 2007 increase in consolidated service revenues was driven primarily by a 38% increase in Ingenix service revenues due to new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses and from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. In addition, UnitedHealthcare service revenues increased due to a 3% increase in the number of individuals served under commercial fee-based arrangements during 2007, as well as annual rate increases. Product Revenues. The 2007 increase in consolidated product revenues was driven by pharmacy sales growth at Prescription Solutions primarily due to providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members. Investment and Other Income. Interest income increased by $239 million in 2007, driven by increased levels of cash and fixed-income investments, due in part to deposits held for certain government-sponsored programs during 2007 and the lack of share repurchase activity in the first two and one half months of 2007. Net realized gains on sales of investments were $38 million in 2007 and $4 million in 2006. Medical Costs The consolidated medical care ratio decreased primarily due to a decrease in the medical care ratio relating to Ovations which was partially offset by an increase in the commercial medical care ratio resulting from our 39 Table of Contents internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment, as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007. Medical costs for 2007 included approximately $420 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2006 included approximately $430 million of favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Medical costs for 2007 increased primarily due to an annual medical cost trend of 7% to 8% on commercial risk-based business due to medical cost inflation and increased utilization, as well as growth in Ovations Medicare programs, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio for 2007 was consistent with 2006. The operating cost ratio reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and other cost management initiatives, offset by the effect of business mix change as fee-based businesses such as Ingenix increase in size and impact, as well as increased investment in technology, service and product enhancements; incremental marketing and advertising costs for Medicare Advantage products; and expenses in the first quarter of 2007 associated with the application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A to our historical stock option practices, as described in “2008 Results Compared to 2007 Results” above. The increase in operating costs in 2007 was primarily due to general operating cost inflation and was also impacted by the items discussed above. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased in 2007 primarily due to costs associated with increased pharmacy sales at Prescription Solutions as a result of providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and Part D members in 2007. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2007 was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology enhancements, business growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006, as well as separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions since the beginning of 2006. Reporting Segments Health Care Services UnitedHealthcare revenues of $40.3 billion in 2007 increased by $821 million, or 2%, over 2006. This increase was driven mainly by average net premium rate increases of 7% to 8% on UnitedHealthcare’s renewing commercial risk-based products, an increase in the number of individuals served by commercial fee-based products and businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in the number of individuals served by commercial risk-based products in 2007 primarily due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment and the conversion of certain groups to commercial fee-based products. Ovations revenues of $26.5 billion in 2007 increased by approximately $1.8 billion, or 7%, over 2006. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement and Evercare products, and rate increases on Medicare Advantage products as well as continued growth in our Medicare Part D program. The remaining Health Care Services revenue increase 40 Table of Contents resulted from an increase in AmeriChoice revenues of $750 million, or 20%, over 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid products as well as rate increases. The increase in Health Care Services earnings from operations in 2007 was principally driven by a decrease in the medical care ratio for Ovations primarily due to favorable medical cost trends and an increase in the number of individuals served by certain Medicare products and related rate increases discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in individuals served by commercial risk-based products and an increase in the related medical care ratio. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 82.6% in 2007 from 80.5% in 2006. This increase was mainly due to our internal pricing decisions in a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment as well as a shift from favorable medical cost development for UnitedHealthcare during 2006 to unfavorable medical cost development during 2007, which was partially driven by costs from higher benefit utilization in December 2006 primarily relating to high-deductible risk-based products. The Health Care Services operating margin for 2007 was 9.3%, an increase from 8.6% in 2006, which reflected productivity gains from technology deployment and disciplined operating cost management as well as the factors discussed above. The increase in the number of individuals served with commercial fee-based products as of December 31, 2007 was driven by new customer relationships and customers converting from risk-based products to fee-based products, partially offset by employment attrition at continuing customers. The number of individuals served with commercial risk-based products decreased primarily due to a competitive pricing environment and the conversion of individuals to fee-based products. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products as of December 31, 2007 decreased primarily due to a decline in participation in private-fee-for-service offerings, while individuals served by standardized Medicare supplement products increased due to new customer relationships. Medicaid enrollment increased in 2007 primarily due to new customer gains, including 180,000 individuals served under the TennCare program in Tennessee. OptumHealth The OptumHealth revenues increase was principally driven by an increase in the number of individuals served by several of its specialty benefit businesses and rate increases related to these businesses. OptumHealth earnings from operations increased in 2007 primarily due to the membership growth and rate increases. The OptumHealth operating margin declined from 18.6% in 2006 to 18.2% in 2007 due to a continued business mix shift toward higher revenue, lower margin products, partially offset by effective operating cost management. Ingenix The Ingenix revenues increase in 2007 was primarily driven by new business growth in the health information and contract research businesses as well as from businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006. The increase in earnings from operations was primarily due to growth in the health information and contract research businesses, businesses acquired since the beginning of 2006 and effective operating cost management. The operating margin was 20.4% in 2007, up from 18.4% in 2006. This increase in operating margin was largely driven by business growth and operating cost management described above. Prescription Solutions The Prescription Solutions revenues increase in 2007 was primarily driven by providing prescription drug benefit services to an additional four million Ovations Medicare Advantage and stand-alone Part D members. 41 Table of Contents Intersegment revenues were eliminated in consolidation and amounted to $12.4 billion and $3.4 billion for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased largely due to the expansion of services to Medicare Part D members discussed above. The operating margin was 2.0% in 2007, a decrease from 3.4% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin reflected the comparatively lower margin earned in the high volume Ovations Medicare Part D prescription drug service contracts. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity and Financial Condition We manage our cash, investments and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. These investments are made pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances, which focuses on preservation of capital, diversification and duration. Cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities is paid to their non-regulated parent companies, typically in the form of dividends, for general corporate use, when and as permitted by applicable regulations. Our non-regulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses by making capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions and repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Cash flows generated from operating activities, our primary source of liquidity, are principally from net earnings, prior to depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The level of profitability of our risk-based business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases. This risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses, the geographic and customer diversity of our risk-based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes, which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs. 42 Table of Contents A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below. For the Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sources of Cash: Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 4,238 $ 5,877 $ 6,526 Maturities and Sales of Investments 8,598 3,365 4,096 Proceeds from Issuance of Long-Term Debt 2,981 3,582 3,000 Other 1,770 1,962 2,395 Total Sources of Cash 17,587 14,786 16,017 Uses of Cash: Purchases of Investments (9,251 ) (6,379 ) (4,851 ) Cash Paid for Acquisitions, net of cash assumed and dispositions (3,813 ) (262 ) (670 ) Common Stock Repurchases (2,684 ) (6,599 ) (2,345 ) Other (3,278 ) (3,001 ) (3,252 ) Total Uses of Cash (19,026 ) (16,241 ) (11,118 ) Net (Decrease) Increase in Cash $ (1,439 ) $ (1,455 ) $ 4,899 Net cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.6 billion in 2008, or 28%, primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of $1.7 billion which included payments of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices. For detail on these settlements, see Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2008, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $21.4 billion included $7.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $13.5 billion of debt securities and $477 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our investment portfolio has a relatively short average duration and a weighted average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2008. Included in the debt securities balance is $3.3 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of December 31, 2008 for the securities for which such information is available. Commercial Paper. Commercial paper consisted of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities up to 270 days. As of December 31, 2008, we had $101 million of outstanding commercial paper with interest rates ranging from 5.1% to 7.1%. This range in rates reflects increases in the market rates for Tier-2 credit-rated commercial paper. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices. During 2008, we repurchased 72 million shares at an average price of approximately $37 per share and an aggregate cost of approximately $2.7 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 103 million shares of our common stock. 43 Table of Contents Capital Resources As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had commercial paper and long-term debt outstanding of $12.8 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments. We maintained a highly liquid position, with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $21.6 billion as of December 31, 2008. As further described under “Dividend Restrictions,” many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $865 million of our $21.6 billion of cash and investments was held by non-regulated subsidiaries and was available for general corporate use, including acquisitions and share repurchases. Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registering an unlimited amount of debt securities. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2008 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior Unsecured Debt Baa1 Stable A- Negative A- Negative Commercial Paper P-2 n/a A-2 n/a F1 n/a See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of our risks related to downgrades in our credit ratings. Debt Covenants. Our debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants, the most restrictive of which require us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio (calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity) was 38.1% and 35.4% as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. We were in compliance with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2008. In August 2006, we received a purported notice of default from persons claiming to hold our 5.8% Senior Unsecured Notes due March 15, 2036 alleging a violation of the indenture governing those debt securities. This followed our announcement that we would delay filing our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the proceeding regarding the purported default. Bank Credit Facilities. In November 2008, we entered into a $750 million 364-day revolving bank credit facility which replaced our $1.5 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility entered into in November 2007. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate ranged from 2.9% to 4.3%. In May 2007, we amended and restated our $1.3 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility which included increasing the capacity. There is currently $2.5 billion available under this credit facility which matures in May 2012. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. At December 31, 2008, the interest rate ranged from 0.6% to 2.0%. 44 Table of Contents These credit facilities support our commercial paper program and are available for general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. Dividend Restrictions. We conduct a significant portion of our operations through subsidiaries that are subject to regulations and standards established by their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. An inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures, business acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. In addition, an inability to pay regulated dividends could impact our ability to repay our debt; however, our cash flows from operations of our unregulated businesses, as well as liquidity at the parent level in the form of cash and cash equivalent balances and commercial paper or bank funding, mitigate this risk. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our risks related to dividend restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries. In 2008, based on the 2007 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was $3.0 billion. As of December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries have paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators. In 2007, the maximum amount of dividends which could be paid without prior regulatory approval was $2.5 billion. In 2007, $2.9 billion was paid to their parent companies, including $400 million of extraordinary dividends approved by state insurance regulators. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2008, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2009 2010 to 2011 2012 to 2013 Thereafter Total Debt and Commercial Paper (a) $ 1,456 $ 1,819 $ 1,515 $ 8,004 $ 12,794 Interest on Debt and Commercial Paper (b) 425 793 724 5,792 7,734 Operating Leases 258 425 303 688 1,674 Purchase Obligations (c) 149 45 1 — 195 Future Policy Benefits (d) 154 335 326 1,196 2,011 Unrecognized Tax Benefits (e) 2 — — 205 207 Unfunded Investment Commitments (f) 134 82 10 10 236 Other Long-Term Obligations (g) 56 2 — 319 377 Total Contractual Obligations $ 2,634 $ 3,501 $ 2,879 $ 16,214 $ 25,228 (a) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of acceleration is remote. (b) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2008 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. (c) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes 45 Table of Contents agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2008. (d) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48). Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.” See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition. See Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (g) Includes future payments to optionholders related to the application of Section 409A, as well as obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition discussed below, which have been classified as “Thereafter” due to uncertainty regarding payment timing. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2008, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (FSP 142-3). FSP 142-3 amends the factors to be considered in developing renewal and extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset accounted for under FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” FSP 142-3 is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after January 1, 2009. Early adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (FAS 141R), which replaces FAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in our financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively to all new acquisitions closing on or after January 1, 2009. Early adoption of this standard is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 141R will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51” (FAS 160). FAS 160 requires that accounting and reporting for minority interests be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The 46 Table of Contents standard is effective for our fiscal year 2009 and must be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160 will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Historically, the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than 1% of annual medical costs, less than 5% of annual earnings from operations and less than 4% of medical costs payable. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. We do not believe that completion factors are a reliable basis for estimating claims incurred for the most recent three months as there is typically insufficient claim data available for those months to calculate credible completion factors. Accordingly, for the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease 47 Table of Contents Control, as well as through a review of near-term completion factors. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2008: Completion FactorsIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs (in millions) (0.75)% $ 148 (0.50)% $ 99 (0.25)% $ 49 0.25% $ (49 ) 0.50% $ (98 ) 0.75% $ (146 ) Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2008: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs (in millions) 3% $ 281 2% $ 187 1% $ 94 (1)% $ (94 ) (2)% $ (187 ) (3)% $ (281 ) The analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. In order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period, one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period. The accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations: (in millions) FavorableDevelopment Increase (Decrease)to Medical Costs (a) Medical Costs Earnings from Operations As Reported As Adjusted (b) As Reported As Adjusted (b) 2006 $ 430 $ 10 $ 53,308 $ 53,318 $ 6,984 $ 6,974 2007 $ 420 $ 190 $ 55,435 $ 55,625 $ 7,849 $ 7,659 2008 $ 230 $ (c) $ 60,359 $ (c) $ 5,263 $ (c) (a) The amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year.

(c) Not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2009 will change as our December 31, 2008 medical costs payable estimate develops throughout 2009. 48 Table of Contents Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2008, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2008, however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2008 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2008 net earnings would increase or decrease by $48 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.04 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs, coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate are expected to have higher medical costs. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. Necessary and available diagnosis data collected and captured by us and health care providers is submitted to CMS within prescribed deadlines. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets As of December 31, 2008, we had long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets and property, equipment and capitalized software, of $24.6 billion. We review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, and we review our remaining long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value. To determine the fair value of our long-lived assets and assess their recoverability, we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows, which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues, expenses and operating margins. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the 49 Table of Contents future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in the period in which the impairment occurs. There were no material impairments at December 31, 2008. Investments As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $14.1 billion of investments, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2008, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $312 million and gross unrealized losses of $349 million. If any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other-than-temporary, based on analysis of relevant factors, we record a realized loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment’s fair value is other-than-temporary. We analyze relevant factors individually and in combination including the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known or when we do not anticipate holding the investment until recovery and record any resulting impairment charges at that time. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities, asset-backed, and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. If securities are downgraded below policy minimums, subsequent to purchase, they will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a description of the risks related to our pending regulatory inquiries and litigation. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. Government and Agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2008, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A”. As of December 31, 2008, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $7.4 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, approximately $7.2 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2008 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts, which may materially impact our interest expense. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $13.7 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities, and approximately $5.6 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt with no related interest rate swap contracts. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. The differential between the fixed rates received and the variable rates paid is accrued and recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our swap agreements converted a majority of our interest expense from a fixed to variable rates to better offset the impact of market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. In January 2009, we terminated $4.9 billion notional of interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions to lock-in the benefit of current low market interest rates. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2008 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments Fair Value ofDebt 2% $ 149 $ 133 $ (1,009 ) $ (719 ) 1% 74 66 (504 ) (392 ) (1)% (74 ) (66 ) 497 436 (2)% (149 ) (133 ) 1,012 974 (a) Including the impact of the termination of the interest rate swap contracts in January 2009, a hypothetical 1% change in market interest rates would impact the interest expense per annum by $18 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had $477 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were held in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments. 51 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:28.400937

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto. Readers should be cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, serving more than 70 million Americans. Our focus is on improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost, support the physician/patient relationship, and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well-being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed, typically for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from Ingenix health intelligence and contract research businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities. Our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. 31 Table of Contents Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims, and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business, however, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs, will change the dynamics of our results. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims, purchases of investments, common stock repurchases and payments on long-term debt. For more information on our cash flows, see “Liquidity” below. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 17% of U.S. gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, based on inflation, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and proposed health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. recessionary economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our employer customers, putting pressure on top line growth for our UnitedHealthcare and OptumHealth businesses. This workplace attrition contributed more than half of the 7% decrease in UnitedHealthcare’s commercial membership during 2009, and this attrition trend is expected to continue at a generally elevated level until national employment stabilizes. In contrast, our AmeriChoice business is experiencing growth in its state Medicaid offerings as employment rates fall. If the recessionary economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to recessionary conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points. Changes in federal monetary policy have reduced the level of investment income received on our portfolio on a year-over-year basis. In total, we believe that economic recessions will slow our revenue growth rate and could impact our operating profitability. We also believe that government funding pressure, coupled with recessionary economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 32 Table of Contents American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Our businesses may benefit from elements of the federal economic stimulus package that was enacted in response to the current recession. These elements include expansion of funding to state programs, which could mitigate funding pressure for AmeriChoice Medicaid offerings at the state level, and funding for health care information technology, which could expand market opportunities for Ingenix. Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes. Both houses of Congress have recently passed bills relating to health care reform, which have not yet been reconciled with each other and signed into law. Examples of health care reform proposals include policy changes that would change the dynamics of the health care industry, including having the federal or one or more state governments assume a larger role in the health care system such as competing with private health insurers, imposing new and potentially significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, guaranteed coverage requirements, elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions or annual lifetime maximum limits, restrictions on our ability to price products based on our underwriting standards, or restructuring the Medicare or Medicaid programs, including reducing payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. We cannot predict if any of these proposals will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be. Any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years, but, if enacted, could reduce our revenues, increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our operating results, our financial position, including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes. The administration and various congressional leaders have advanced proposals to reduce payments over the intermediate term to private plans offering Medicare Advantage. Further, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of approximately 5% for 2010. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, terminated benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the Medicare Advantage program. Our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by these reductions. If industry-wide Medicare Advantage membership declines, there is likely to be increased demand for Medicare Supplemental insurance and Part D prescription drug coverage, and in both categories Ovations is a market leader. We operate a diversified set of health care focused businesses; this business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. Therefore, we could see simultaneous increases and decreases in demand for our various products and services, depending on the scope, shape and timing of health care reforms. It is difficult to predict the outcome of reform discussions with precision over the mid- to long-term time horizon. For discussions regarding our risks related to health care reforms, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 33 Table of Contents RESULTS SUMMARY The following summarizes the consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31: (in millions, except percentages and pershare data) Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 REVENUES: Premiums $ 79,315 $ 73,608 $ 68,781 $ 5,707 8 % $ 4,827 7 % Services 5,306 5,152 4,608 154 3 544 12 Products 1,925 1,655 898 270 16 757 84 Investment and other income 592 771 1,144 (179 ) (23 ) (373 ) (33 ) Total revenues 87,138 81,186 75,431 5,952 7 5,755 8 OPERATING COSTS: Medical costs 65,289 60,359 55,435 4,930 8 4,924 9 Medical care ratio 82.3 % 82.0 % 80.6 % 0.3 1.4 Operating costs 12,734 13,103 10,583 (369 ) (3 ) 2,520 24 Operating cost ratio 14.6 % 16.1 % 14.0 % (1.5 ) 2.1 Cost of products sold 1,765 1,480 768 285 19 712 93 Depreciation and amortization 991 981 796 10 1 185 23 Total operating costs 80,779 75,923 67,582 4,856 6 8,341 12 EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS 6,359 5,263 7,849 1,096 21 (2,586 ) (33 ) Operating margin 7.3 % 6.5 % 10.4 % 0.8 (3.9 ) Interest expense (551 ) (639 ) (544 ) (88 ) (14 ) 95 17 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES 5,808 4,624 7,305 1,184 26 (2,681 ) (37 ) Provision for income taxes (1,986 ) (1,647 ) (2,651 ) 339 21 (1,004 ) (38 ) Tax rate 34.2 % 35.6 % 36.3 % (1.4 ) (0.7 ) NET EARNINGS $ 3,822 $ 2,977 $ 4,654 $ 845 28 % $ (1,677 ) (36 ) % DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE $ 3.24 $ 2.40 $ 3.42 $ 0.84 35 % $ (1.02 ) (30 ) % RETURN ON EQUITY 17.3 % 14.9 % 22.4 % 2.4 % (7.5 ) % TOTAL PEOPLE SERVED 70 73 71 (3 ) (4 ) % 2 3 % ACQUISITIONS AIM Healthcare Services, Inc. On June 1, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of AIM Healthcare Services, Inc. (AIM) for approximately $440 million in cash. AIM is a leading provider of payment accuracy solutions for health care payer and hospital clients in all 50 states. This acquisition strengthened our capabilities to simplify and improve administration in the health care industry. The results of operations and financial condition of AIM have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Ingenix reporting segment since the acquisition date. Unison Health Plans. On May 30, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Unison Health Plans (Unison) for approximately $930 million in cash. Unison provides government-sponsored health plan coverage to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee, Delaware, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. through a network of independent health care professionals. This acquisition strengthened our resources and capabilities in these areas. The results of operations and financial condition of Unison have been included in our consolidated results and the results of our Health Benefits reporting segment since the acquisition date. 34 Table of Contents Sierra Health Services, Inc. On February 25, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sierra Health Services, Inc. (Sierra), a diversified health care services company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, for approximately $2.6 billion in cash, representing a price of $43.50 per share of Sierra common stock. This acquisition strengthened our position in the southwest region of the United States. The U.S. Department of Justice approved the acquisition conditioned upon the divestiture of our individual Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Clark and Nye Counties, Nevada, which represented approximately 30,000 members. The divestiture was completed on April 30, 2008. We received proceeds of $185 million for this transaction, which were recorded as a reduction to Operating Costs. Group Medicare Advantage plans offered through commercial contracts were excluded from the divestiture. Also, we retained Sierra’s Medicare Advantage HMO plans in Nevada. The results of operations and financial condition of Sierra have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. Fiserv Health, Inc. On January 10, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fiserv Health, Inc. (Fiserv Health), a subsidiary of Fiserv, Inc., for approximately $740 million in cash. Fiserv Health is a leading administrator of medical benefits and also provides care facilitation services, specialty health solutions and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. This transaction allows us to expand the capacity of our existing benefits administration businesses and enables existing and new customers to leverage our full range of assets, including ancillary services, our national network and technology tools. The results of operations and financial condition of Fiserv Health have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the Health Benefits, OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions reporting segments since the acquisition date. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, aggregate consideration paid, net of cash assumed for smaller acquisitions was $95 million, $94 million and $262 million, respectively. These acquisitions were not material to our results of operations. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market. The effect of 2008 Health Benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk-based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, unemployment-related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $310 million and $230 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management, which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate. 35 Table of Contents Operating costs for 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008. Income Tax Rate Our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: • Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare, Ovations and AmeriChoice; • OptumHealth; • Ingenix; and • Prescription Solutions. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and consulting and other services sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 36 Table of Contents The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Revenues Health Benefits $ 81,341 $ 75,857 $ 71,199 $ 5,484 7 % $ 4,658 7 % OptumHealth 5,528 5,225 4,921 303 6 304 6 Ingenix 1,823 1,552 1,304 271 17 248 19 Prescription Solutions 14,452 12,573 13,249 1,879 15 (676 ) (5 ) Eliminations (16,006 ) (14,021 ) (15,242 ) (1,985 ) nm 1,221 nm Consolidated revenues $ 87,138 $ 81,186 $ 75,431 $ 5,952 7 % $ 5,755 8 % Earnings from Operations Health Benefits $ 4,788 $ 5,068 $ 6,595 $ (280 ) (6 )% $ (1,527 ) (23 )% OptumHealth 636 718 895 (82 ) (11 ) (177 ) (20 ) Ingenix 246 229 266 17 7 (37 ) (14 ) Prescription Solutions 689 363 269 326 90 94 35 Corporate — (1,115 ) (176 ) 1,115 nm (939 ) nm Consolidated earnings from operations $ 6,359 $ 5,263 $ 7,849 $ 1,096 21 % $ (2,586 ) (33 )% Operating Margin Health Benefits 5.9 % 6.7 % 9.3 % (0.8 )% (2.6 )% OptumHealth 11.5 13.7 18.2 (2.2 ) (4.5 ) Ingenix 13.5 14.8 20.4 (1.3 ) (5.6 ) Prescription Solutions 4.8 2.9 2.0 1.9 0.9 Consolidated operating margin 7.3 % 6.5 % 10.4 % 0.8 % (3.9 )% nm = not meaningful The following summarizes the number of individuals served by our Health Benefits segment, by major market segment and funding arrangement, at December 31: Increase(Decrease) Increase(Decrease) (in thousands, except percentages) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Commercial risk-based 9,415 10,360 10,805 (945 ) (9 )% (445 ) (4 )% Commercial fee-based 15,210 15,985 14,720 (775 ) (5 ) 1,265 9 Total commercial 24,625 26,345 25,525 (1,720 ) (7 ) 820 3 Medicare Advantage 1,790 1,495 1,370 295 20 125 9 Medicaid 2,900 2,515 1,710 385 15 805 47 Standardized Medicare supplement 2,680 2,540 2,400 140 6 140 6 Total public and senior 7,370 6,550 5,480 820 13 1,070 20 Total people served by Health Benefits 31,995 32,895 31,005 (900 ) (3 )% 1,890 6 % 37 Table of Contents Health Benefits Revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower short-term investment yields. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $40.8 billion for 2009 decreased by $1.0 billion, or 2%, compared to 2008, as the reduction in individuals served was partially offset by premium rate increases. Ovations revenues of $32.1 billion for 2009 increased by $4.1 billion, or 15%, over 2008, primarily due to an increase in individuals served through Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage and standardized Medicare Supplement offerings, as well as premium rate increases. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $8.4 billion for 2009, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 40%, over the comparable 2008 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans and premium rate increases as well as the full year impact from the mid-2008 Unison acquisition. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a $166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business, partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. The 2009 UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 84.0% from 83.5% in 2008, largely due to elevated medical costs related to the H1N1 influenza virus and a higher proportion of participants receiving care under unemployment-related benefit continuation programs. Health Benefits’ operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations. OptumHealth Increased OptumHealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in large-scale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients, which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, OptumHealth provided services to approximately 58 million and 60 million consumers, respectively. Earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above, start-up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income, partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management. Ingenix Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings, including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion, hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, strong success under performance-based purchasing arrangements, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. 38 Table of Contents 2008 RESULTS COMPARED TO 2007 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to the increase in premium revenue in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The premium revenue growth generated by our Health Benefits reporting segment was the primary driver in the consolidated premium revenues increase. This increase was due to the growth in individuals served by public and senior markets businesses, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and acquisitions completed in 2008, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk-based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. Investment and Other Income. The decrease in investment and other income in 2008 was primarily due to lower investment yields primarily because of the decrease in interest rates on our cash equivalents, decreased average investment balances related to lower operating cash flows, decreased deposits held for certain government-sponsored programs and increased other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the disruption in the financial markets. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2008 increased primarily due to medical cost inflation, acquisitions completed in 2008 and growth in Ovations Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement products, partially offset by a decrease in the number of individuals served through both UnitedHealthcare risk-based products and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. For 2008 and 2007, medical costs included $230 million and $420 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs The operating cost ratio increased in 2008 primarily due to certain expenses as described in “2009 Results of Operations Compared to 2008 Results” above, acquisitions completed in 2008, costs for anticipated revenue growth that did not fully materialize and a change in business mix towards service revenues from fee-based businesses. Operating costs for 2007 include $176 million of expenses recorded in the first quarter of 2007 related to application of deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) to our historical stock option practices. The $176 million Section 409A charge includes $87 million of expenses for the payment of certain optionholders’ tax obligations for stock options exercised in 2006 and early 2007 and $89 million of expenses for the modification related to increasing the exercise price of unexercised stock options granted to nonexecutive officer employees and the related cash payments. For an expanded discussion of our Section 409A charges, see Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and Amortization The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily related to higher levels of computer equipment and capitalized software as a result of technology development and enhancements, as well as additional depreciation and amortization related to business acquisitions. Income Tax Rate The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings resulting in an increased proportion of tax-free investment income to total earnings. 39 Table of Contents Reporting Segments Health Benefits The revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2008 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our Public and Senior Markets Group, premium rate increases for medical cost inflation and the 2008 acquisitions of Sierra, Fiserv Health, and Unison, partially offset by an organic decline in individuals served through commercial risk-based products and Medicare Part D products and a decrease in investment income. UnitedHealthcare revenues of $41.8 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 4%. The UnitedHealthcare increase was primarily driven by the same factors as discussed for Health Benefits in 2008. Ovations revenues of $28.1 billion in 2008 increased over the comparable 2007 period by $1.6 billion, or 6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in individuals served with the standardized Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products gained through both organic growth and the Sierra acquisition and premium rate increases, which were partially offset by a net organic decrease of 675,000 stand-alone Medicare Part D members primarily due to the reassignment by CMS of certain dual-eligible low income beneficiaries based on annual price bids. AmeriChoice generated revenues of $6.0 billion in 2008, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 34%, over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to an increase in the number of individuals served by Medicaid plans, premium rate increases and the acquisition of Unison in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations was primarily due to pressure on enrollment and gross margins in the UnitedHealthcare risk-based business and pressure on gross margins in Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, partially offset by acquisitions. The UnitedHealthcare medical care ratio increased to 83.5% in 2008 from 82.6% in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by the effects of a competitive pricing environment where price increases, net of customer benefit package changes, did not fully match the rise in medical costs, and an increased mix of national account pharmaceutical benefit business, which typically carries a higher medical care ratio. Health Benefits’ operating margin was 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease from 9.3% in 2007 primarily driven by the factors discussed above. The number of individuals served with commercial products increased due to acquisitions, which included the addition of 1,315,000 fee-based members from Fiserv Health and the addition of 310,000 risk-based individuals gained through the Sierra acquisition. These additions were partially offset by a net decline in individuals served with commercial products of 805,000, or 3%, from December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decline in individuals served with commercial risk-based products and the impact of a competitive commercial risk-based pricing environment. The number of individuals served by Medicare Advantage products at December 31, 2008 increased through the addition of 60,000 seniors from our acquisition of Sierra and organic growth of 95,000 seniors, partially offset by the divestiture of 30,000 individuals in Nevada related to the Sierra acquisition. Medicaid enrollment grew due to the addition of 320,000 and 60,000 individuals from our Unison and Sierra acquisitions, respectively, and strong organic growth of 425,000 individuals. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth were driven by rate increases for medical cost inflation and an increased number of consumers served by this segment. OptumHealth provided services to approximately 60 million consumers at December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 1 million individuals year-over-year. Earnings from operations and operating margin decreased due to the increased costs for risk-based behavioral and specialty benefits businesses and the mix of continued growth in lower margin business. Ingenix The improvement in Ingenix revenues was due to continued growth in its health intelligence and contract research businesses as well as from business acquisitions. The decrease in earnings from operations and operating margin was primarily due to excess staffing costs during 2008 for certain research projects, which were cancelled, as well as lower demand for certain consulting services due to the current economic environment. 40 Table of Contents Prescription Solutions The decreased Prescription Solutions revenues were primarily due to the reduction in the number of individuals served related to the reassignment of dual-eligible beneficiaries described above through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our Ovations business, and a shift from name brand pharmaceuticals towards generic utilization, partially offset by revenues related to the Fiserv Health acquisition and growth in business with unaffiliated clients. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $11.0 billion and $12.4 billion for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations increased primarily due to the Fiserv Health acquisition, gains in mail service drug fulfillment, and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before depreciation, amortization and other non-cash expenses. As a result, any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity. The diversity of our businesses, our geographic and customer diversity and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses, which seek to match premium rate increases with future expected medical costs, partially mitigates the risk of rising medical and operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2009, based on the 2008 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends that could be paid was $3.1 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $1.2 billion of extraordinary dividends. The increase in the proportion of extraordinary dividends to total dividends in 2009 primarily reflects the acceleration of dividend timing, as well as the size of specific dividends beyond ordinary levels. Given expected statutory capital levels, we anticipate lower overall regulated subsidiary dividends in 2010. 41 Table of Contents Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, expanding our services through business acquisitions, repaying debt and/or repurchasing shares of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Results A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sources of Cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 5,625 $ 4,238 $ 5,877 Sales of investments 4,040 5,568 1,271 Maturities of investments 2,675 3,030 2,094 Issuance of long-term debt — 2,981 3,582 Interest rate swap termination 513 — — Other 546 1,770 1,962 Total sources of cash 13,399 17,587 14,786 Uses of Cash: Purchases of investments (6,466 ) (9,251 ) (6,379 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and disposition (486 ) (3,813 ) (262 ) Retirement of long-term debt (1,350 ) (500 ) (950 ) Common stock repurchases (1,801 ) (2,684 ) (6,599 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net (99 ) (1,346 ) — Other (823 ) (1,432 ) (2,051 ) Total uses of cash (11,025 ) (19,026 ) (16,241 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash $ 2,374 $ (1,439 ) $ (1,455 ) 2009 Cash Flows Compared To 2008 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.4 billion, or 33%, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk-based products in the public and senior markets businesses, and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with CMS related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts. We anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings, the timing of certain CMS payments and the impact of a legislated change to the timing of payments for Medicare Part D claims. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.1 billion, or 81%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments, which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $1.7 billion due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. See Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our policy on offsetting cash balances. These items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts. 42 Table of Contents 2008 Cash Flows Compared To 2007 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities decreased $1.6 billion, or 28%, primarily due to the decrease in net earnings, which included payments for the settlement of two class action lawsuits described above. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $925 million, or 22%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and increases in the usage of cash in 2008 for purchases of investments offset by the 2008 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $2.6 billion, or 81%, primarily due to decreases in common stock repurchases in 2008 offset by the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $24.2 billion included $9.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents (which included $2.3 billion held by non-regulated entities), $13.8 billion of debt securities and $577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows, reduce the need to sell investments in adverse markets. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of 2.1 years and a weighted average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2009. Included in the debt securities balance were $3.0 billion of state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by third parties. A number of different guarantors guarantee the securities, and we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of December 31, 2009. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and significant cash and cash equivalent balances at our regulated and unregulated entities, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt sold on a discount basis with maturities of up to 270 days through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We did not have any commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Bank Credit Facility. We have a five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2009. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. As of December 31, 2009, the interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.4% to 0.7%. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as the sum of commercial paper and debt divided by the sum of commercial paper, debt and shareholders’ equity, was 32.1% and 38.1% as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. We complied with the requirements of all debt covenants as of December 31, 2009. 43 Table of Contents Shelf Registration. In February 2008, we filed a universal S-3 shelf registration statement with the SEC registering an unspecified amount of debt securities. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt Baa1 Stable A- Negative A- Negative Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-2 n/a F1 n/a The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility to mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes. We believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost. We used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market. In 2009, we repurchased 74.3 million shares at an average price of approximately $24 per share and an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to an additional 28.7 million shares of our common stock. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of December 31, 2009, under our various contractual obligations and commitments: (in millions) 2010 2011 to 2012 2013 to 2014 Thereafter Total Debt (a) $ 2,164 $ 1,361 $ 1,559 $ 6,089 $ 11,173 Interest on debt (b) 545 659 406 3,549 5,159 Operating leases 255 420 272 644 1,591 Purchase obligations (c) 115 31 — — 146 Future policy benefits (d) 139 353 337 1,152 1,981 Unrecognized tax benefits (e) 19 — — 104 123 Unfunded investment commitments (f) 138 42 24 16 220 Other obligations (g) 210 80 — 252 542 Total contractual obligations $ 3,585 $ 2,946 $ 2,598 $ 11,806 $ 20,935 (a) See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (b) Calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term, including the effect of the debt tender described in Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2009 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. Includes unamortized discounts from par values. (c) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009. 44 Table of Contents (d) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts held by a divested entity. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.” See Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and the investment commitment related to the PacifiCare acquisition. (g) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration related to a business acquisition, certain employee benefit programs, and charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs and the charitable contributions have been classified as “Thereafter”. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we were not involved in any SPE transactions. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements” (ASU 2009-13). This update removes the criterion that entities must use objective and reliable evidence of fair value in separately accounting for deliverables and provides entities with a hierarchy of evidence that must be considered when allocating arrangement consideration. The new guidance also requires entities to allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on the deliverables’ relative selling price. The provisions will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year 2011 and must be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2009-13. We have determined that all other recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, or do not apply to our operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but 45 Table of Contents not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2009, 2008 and 2007, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $310 million, $230 million and $420 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2009: Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 171 (0.50) 114 (0.25) 57 0.25 (57 ) 0.50 (113 ) 0.75 (169 ) 46 Table of Contents Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2009: Medical Cost PMPM TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease) inMedical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 332 2 222 1 111 (1) (111 ) (2) (222 ) (3) (332 ) The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2009, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2009; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2009 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2009 net earnings would increase or decrease by $52 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.04 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. 47 Table of Contents CMS deploys a risk adjustment model, which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and other health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2010 and determined that no impairment existed as of December 31, 2009. Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by potential health care reforms as discussed in “Proposed Health Care Reforms and Reimbursement Changes” above, as any passed legislation may significantly change the forecasts and long-term growth rate assumptions for some or all of our reporting units. Intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., customer lists and trademarks). We do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. We calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. We consider many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year. 48 Table of Contents Investments As of December 31, 2009, we had investments with a carrying value of $14.6 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2009, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $493 million and gross unrealized losses of $50 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. 49 Table of Contents The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2009 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $58 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of December 31, 2009, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2009, $9.8 billion of our financial investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $750 million of our debt as of December 31, 2009 was at interest rates that vary with market rates. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, $14.0 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $10.4 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time in normal markets, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap 50 Table of Contents contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. In January 2009, we terminated interest rate swap contracts with $4.9 billion in notional value to lock-in the benefit of low market interest rates. This gain will be realized over the remaining life of the applicable hedged fixed-rate debt as a reduction to interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the impact of a hypothetical change in market interest rates by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2009 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments Fair Value ofDebt 2% $ 196 $ 15 $ (1,059 ) $ (1,187 ) 1 98 8 (540 ) (633 ) (1) (15 ) (6 ) 541 730 (2) nm nm 1,075 1,579 nm = not meaningful (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2009, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates has been floored at zero and does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense. As of December 31, 2009, we had $577 million of equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments. 51 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:27.591884

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto. Readers are cautioned that the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW General UnitedHealth Group is a diversified health and well-being company, whose focus is on improving the overall health and well-being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system. We work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care. We help people get the care they need at an affordable cost; support the physician/patient relationship; and empower people with the information, guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions. Through our diversified family of businesses, we leverage core competencies in advanced technology-based transactional capabilities; health care data, knowledge and information; and health care resource organization and care facilitation to help make health care work better. These core competencies are focused in two market areas, health benefits and health services. Health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses. Health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself, ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our OptumHealth, Ingenix and Prescription Solutions businesses. In aggregate, these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets. Each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well-being: access, affordability, quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market. Revenues Our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk-based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one-year period, and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers’ health care benefits and related administrative costs. We also generate revenues from fee-based services performed for customers that self-insure the health care costs of their employees and employees’ dependants. For both risk-based and fee-based health care benefit arrangements, we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; health care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. We also generate service revenues from Ingenix health intelligence and consulting businesses. Product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of Ingenix publishing and software products. We derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities. Our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold, or other-than-temporarily impaired. Operating Costs Medical Costs. Our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable care provider 37 Table of Contents contracts and care coordination programs. Controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients/consumers, health professionals, hospitals, pharmaceutical/technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders. Medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims, and our estimates for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. Our medical care ratio, calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, reflects the combination of pricing, benefit designs, consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts. We seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government-sponsored public sector programs and recently enacted Health Reform Legislation may impact our premiums, medical costs and medical care ratio. In 2011, we expect consumer usage of the health system to increase, resuming its upward growth pattern from the recent moderation in utilization growth. We will work to manage medical cost trends through affordable network relationships, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers, and targeted clinical initiatives around improving quality and affordability. However, an increase in utilization will likely result in increased medical costs and an increase in our medical care ratio. Operating Costs. Operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits, agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and assessments, professional fees, advertising and occupancy costs. We seek to improve our operating cost ratio, calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues, for an equivalent mix of business. However, changes in business mix, such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio. Cash Flows We generate cash primarily from premiums, service and product revenues and investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments. Our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs, payments on debt, purchases of investments, acquisitions, dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases. For more information on our cash flows, see “Liquidity” below. 2011 Business Realignment On January 1, 2011, we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves. For example, in 2011 OptumHealth’s results of operations will include our clinical services assets, including Southwest Medical multi-specialty clinics in Nevada and our Evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly, which had historically been reported in UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual and UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, respectively. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s results of operations will include OptumHealth Specialty Benefits, including dental, vision, life and disability. There were no changes to our reportable segments as a result of these changes. Our periodic filings beginning with our first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment. Business Trends Our businesses participate in the U.S. health economy, which comprises approximately 18% of U.S. gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years. We expect overall spending on health care in 38 Table of Contents the U.S. to continue to rise in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macro-economic conditions and enacted health care reforms, which could also impact our results of operations. Health Care Reforms. In the first quarter of 2010, the Health Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Health Reform Legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market, the Medicaid and Medicare programs, CHIP and other aspects of the health care system. HHS, the DOL and the Treasury Department have issued regulations (or proposed regulations) on a number of aspects of Health Reform Legislation, but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation, all of which have a variety of effective dates. We operate a diversified set of businesses that focus on health care, and our business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors. The Health Reform Legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth in certain products and market segments, restrict premium rate increases for certain products and market segments, increase our medical and administrative costs or expose us to an increased risk of liability, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We also anticipate that the Health Reform Legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality, as well as in prevention, wellness and disease management. We believe demand for many of our service offerings, such as consulting services, data management, information technology and related infrastructure construction, disease management, and population-based health and wellness programs will continue to grow. Beginning in 2011, health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products, as calculated under the definitions in the Health Reform Legislation and regulations, that fall below certain targets (85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals) will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually. Rebate payments, if any, for 2011 would be made in mid 2012. The potential for and size of the rebates will be measured at the market level, by state and by licensed subsidiary. This disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in estimates of rebates owed in total. In the aggregate, the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained. Depending on the results of the calculation, there is a broad range of potential rebate and other business impacts and there could be meaningful disruption in local health care markets if companies decide to adjust their offerings in response to these requirements. For example, companies could elect to change pricing, modify product features or benefits, adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market. Companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non-medical product features and services. Companies continue to face a significant amount of uncertainty given the breadth of possible changes, including changes in the competitive environment, state rate approval, fluctuations in medical costs, the statistical variation that results from assessing business by state, by license and by market and the potential for meaningful market disruption in 2011 and 2012. We have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to this legislation, including reducing broker commissions, and are evaluating changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment. These changes could impact future growth in these products. Other market participants could also implement changes to their business practices in response to this legislation, which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share. The Health Reform Legislation also requires HHS to maintain an annual review of “unreasonable” increases in premium rates for commercial health plans. HHS recently proposed a regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above 10%, and the proposed rule clarifies that the HHS review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes. The proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and HHS extensive information supporting any rate increase of 10% or more. The 39 Table of Contents Federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases and providing funding to assist in those state-level reviews. Ultimately, rate approval responsibility still lies with the states under the proposed regulation. Depending on the level of anticipated increased scrutiny by the states, there is a broad range of potential business impacts. For example, it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends, leading to the risk of operating margin compression. Effective in 2011, the Health Reform Legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50% on brand name prescription drugs and 7% on generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. This statutory reduction in drug prices for seniors in the coverage gap may cause people who may have had difficulty affording their medications to increase their pharmaceutical usage. The change in pricing could also have secondary effects, such as changing the mix of brand name and generic drug usage by seniors. We have incorporated the anticipated impact of these changes in our 2011 product pricing and pharmacy benefit management business plan. As part of the Health Reform Legislation, Medicare Advantage payment rates for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. Separately, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of 1.6% for 2011. We expect the 2011 rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends, placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plans will take effect (plans will ultimately receive 95% of Medicare fee-for-service rates in high cost areas to 115% in low cost areas), with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a county. All of these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels. There are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations, which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions. For example, we can adjust members’ benefits, decide on a county-by-county basis which geographies to participate in and seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management. Additionally, achieving high quality scores from CMS for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses. Quality bonus payments may further offset these anticipated rate reductions as CMS quality rating bonus payments are phased in over three years beginning in 2012. We also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the anticipated increase in the number of people eligible for Medicare in coming years. Longer term, market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of Medicare Advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our Medicare Part D and Medicare Supplement insurance offerings. The Health Reform Legislation presents additional opportunities and challenges over the longer term, including the assessment of an annual $8 billion insurance industry assessment beginning in 2014, the operation of state-based exchanges for individuals and small businesses beginning in 2014, and numerous other commercial and governmental plan requirements. Individual states may also accelerate their procurement of Medicaid managed care services for sizeable groups of Medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads when Medicaid market expansions take place in 2014. The law could increase near-term business growth opportunities for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Due to the complexity of the health care system and the numerous changes that are taking place, the longer term effect of the new legislation remains difficult to assess. Court proceedings related to the Health Reform Legislation, such as the ruling by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida (in a case brought on behalf of 26 state attorneys general and/or governors) that declared the entire legislation unconstitutional, and the potential for Congressional action to impede implementation, create additional uncertainties with respect to the law. For additional information regarding the Health Reform Legislation and the related risk factors, see Item 1, “Business — Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Adverse Economic Conditions. The current U.S. economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services. For example, decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our customers, and have put pressure on our overall growth and 40 Table of Contents operating profitability. If the current economic environment continues for a prolonged period, federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and/or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments. Government funding pressure, coupled with adverse economic conditions, will impact the financial positions of hospitals, physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses. Our revenues are also impacted by U.S. monetary and fiscal policy. In response to current economic conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to 25 basis points. For additional discussions regarding how the adverse economic conditions could affect our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Part I.

Growth in customers served by our health services businesses, particularly through pharmaceutical benefit management programs, increased revenues from public sector behavioral health programs and increased sales of health care technology software and services also contributed to our revenue growth. Medical Costs and Medical Care Ratio Medical costs for 2010 increased primarily due to growth in our public and senior markets risk-based businesses and medical cost inflation, which were partially offset by net favorable development of prior period medical costs. For 2010 and 2009, there was $800 million and $310 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. The favorable development in 2010 was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels; more efficient claims handling and processing, which results in higher completion factors; a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers; and favorable resolution of certain state-based assessments. The medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services, successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2010 increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses, which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses, goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at Ingenix, which is discussed in more detail below, an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the Medicare Advantage annual enrollment period, costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation, increased advertising costs, and the absorption of new business development and start-up costs. Income Tax Rate The increase in our effective income tax rate for 2010 as compared to 2009 resulted from a benefit in the 2009 tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the 2010 rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the Health Reform Legislation. Reporting Segments We have four reporting segments: • Health Benefits, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement, and UnitedHealthcare Community & State; • OptumHealth; • Ingenix; and • Prescription Solutions. 42 Table of Contents See Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the types and services from which each of these reporting segments derives its revenues. Transactions between reporting segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy benefit products and services to Health Benefits customers by Prescription Solutions, certain product offerings sold to Health Benefits customers by OptumHealth, and medical benefits cost, quality and utilization data and predictive modeling sold to Health Benefits by Ingenix. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The following summarizes the operating results of our reporting segments: Change Change (in millions, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Revenues Health Benefits $ 87,442 $ 81,341 $ 75,857 $ 6,101 8 % $ 5,484 7 % OptumHealth 5,849 5,528 5,225 321 6 303 6 Ingenix 2,341 1,823 1,552 518 28 271 17 Prescription Solutions 16,776 14,452 12,573 2,324 16 1,879 15 Eliminations (18,253 ) (16,006 ) (14,021 ) (2,247 ) nm (1,985 ) nm Consolidated revenues $ 94,155 $ 87,138 $ 81,186 $ 7,017 8 % $ 5,952 7 % Earnings from operations Health Benefits $ 6,636 $ 4,788 $ 5,068 $ 1,848 39 % $ (280 ) (6 )% OptumHealth 610 636 718 (26 ) (4 ) (82 ) (11 ) Ingenix 84 246 229 (162 ) (66 ) 17 7 Prescription Solutions 534 689 363 (155 ) (22 ) 326 90 Corporate 0 0 (1,115 ) 0 nm 1,115 nm Consolidated earnings from operations $ 7,864 $ 6,359 $ 5,263 $ 1,505 24 % $ 1,096 21 % Operating margin Health Benefits 7.6 % 5.9 % 6.7 % 1.7 % (0.8 )% OptumHealth 10.4 11.5 13.7 (1.1 ) (2.2 ) Ingenix 3.6 13.5 14.8 (9.9 ) (1.3 ) Prescription Solutions 3.2 4.8 2.9 (1.6 ) 1.9 Consolidated operating margin 8.4 % 7.3 % 6.5 % 1.1 % 0.8 % nm = not meaningful The following summarizes the number of individuals served by our Health Benefits businesses, by major market segment and funding arrangement, at December 31: Change Change (in thousands, except percentages) 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Commercial risk-based 9,405 9,415 10,360 (10 ) (0 )% (945 ) (9 )% Commercial fee-based 15,405 15,210 15,985 195 1 (775 ) (5 ) Total commercial 24,810 24,625 26,345 185 1 (1,720 ) (7 ) Medicare Advantage 2,070 1,790 1,495 280 16 295 20 Medicaid 3,320 2,900 2,515 420 14 385 15 Standardized Medicare supplement 2,770 2,680 2,540 90 3 140 6 Total public and senior 8,160 7,370 6,550 790 11 820 13 Total Health Benefits – medical 32,970 31,995 32,895 975 3 (900 ) (3 ) Medicare Part D stand-alone 4,530 4,300 4,060 230 5 240 6 Total Health Benefits 37,500 36,295 36,955 1,205 3 % (660 ) (2 )% 43 Table of Contents Health Benefits The revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2010 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and commercial premium rate increases reflecting underlying medical cost trends, partially offset by Medicare Advantage premium rate decreases. In 2010, revenues were $41.2 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $35.9 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $10.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. In 2009, revenues were $40.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $32.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $8.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. Health Benefits earnings from operations and operating margins for 2010 increased over the prior year due to factors that increased revenues described above, continued cost management disciplines on behalf of our commercial and governmental customers, a general moderation in year-over-year growth in demand for medical services and the effect of increased net favorable development in prior period medical costs. OptumHealth Increased revenues in OptumHealth for 2010 were driven by new business development in large scale public sector programs and increased sales of benefits and services to external employer markets, partially offset by a loss of some smaller specialty benefits customers. The operating margin for 2010 decreased due to growth in lower margin public sector business, new market development and startup costs and costs related to the implementation of the Mental Health Parity Act. Ingenix Increased revenues in Ingenix for 2010 were primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and growth in health information technology offerings and services focused on cost and data management and regulatory compliance. The decrease in operating margin for 2010 was primarily due to a goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition of certain i3-branded clinical trial service businesses. In addition, increases in the mix of lower margin business, continued margin pressure in the pharmaceutical services business and continued investments in new growth areas also contributed to the decrease in operating margin in 2010. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the goodwill impairment. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2010 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business and higher prescription volumes. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $14.5 billion and $12.6 billion for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Prescription Solutions operating margin for 2010 decreased due to changes in performance-based pricing contracts with Medicare Part D plan sponsors, which were partially offset by prescription volume growth, increased usage of mail service and generic drugs by consumers and effective operating cost management. 2009 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2008 RESULTS Consolidated Financial Results Revenues Consolidated revenues for 2009 increased primarily due to the increase in premium revenues in the Health Benefits reporting segment. The increase in premium revenues was primarily due to strong organic growth in 44 Table of Contents risk-based offerings in our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases in response to growth in underlying medical costs, partially offset by a decline in the number of people served in the commercial market. The effect of 2008 Health Benefits acquisitions also contributed to the increase in premium revenues during 2009. Medical Costs Medical costs for 2009 increased primarily due to growth in public and senior markets risk-based businesses, elevated medical costs due to the H1N1 influenza virus, unemployment-related benefit continuation programs due to an increased level of national unemployment, medical cost inflation and increased utilization of medical services. For each period, our operating results include the effects of revisions in medical cost estimates related to all prior periods. Changes in medical cost estimates related to prior periods, resulting from more complete claim information identified in the current period, are included in total medical costs reported for the current period. For 2009 and 2008, medical costs included $310 million and $230 million, respectively, of net favorable medical cost development related to prior fiscal years. Operating Costs Operating costs for 2009 decreased due to certain expenses incurred in 2008 as discussed below and disciplined operating cost management, which were partially offset by increased costs due to acquired and organic business growth and from an increase in state insurance assessments levied against premiums, a portion of which was in lieu of state income taxes in one of the states in which we operate. Operating costs for 2008 included $882 million for settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related legal costs, $350 million for the settlement of class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services, $50 million related to estimated costs to conclude a legal matter and $46 million for employee severance related to operating cost reduction initiatives and other items, partially offset by a $185 million reduction in operating costs for proceeds from the sale of certain assets and membership in the individual Medicare Advantage business in Nevada in May 2008. Income Tax Rate Our income tax rate for 2009 decreased primarily due to the favorable resolution of various historical state income tax matters and the change to a premium tax in lieu of an income tax in one of the states in which we operate, which increased operating costs and decreased income taxes. Reporting Segments Health Benefits Revenue growth in Health Benefits for 2009 was primarily due to growth in the number of individuals served by our public and senior markets businesses and premium rate increases, partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products and a decrease in investment and other income driven by lower short-term investment yields. 2009 revenues were $40.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $32.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $8.4 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. 2008 revenues were $41.8 billion for UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual; $28.1 billion for UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; and $6.0 billion for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. The decrease in Health Benefits earnings from operations for 2009 was primarily due to a $166 million reduction in investment and other income and a decrease in commercial business, partially offset by the growth in lower margin public and senior markets businesses. Health Benefits’ operating margins decreased due to the factors that decreased earnings from operations. 45 Table of Contents OptumHealth Increased OptumHealth revenues for 2009 were primarily driven by new business development in large-scale public sector care and behavioral health programs for state clients, which were partially offset by a decline in individuals served through commercial products. Earnings from operations and operating margins for 2009 decreased due to the decrease in commercial membership described above, start-up costs for new large contracts and lower investment income, partially offset by earnings growth from expanding services in the public sector and disciplined operating cost management. Ingenix Improvements in Ingenix revenues and earnings from operations for 2009 were primarily due to the impact of improved performance in the payer business, new internal service offerings and the effect of 2009 acquisitions. The decreases in operating margins for 2009 were primarily due to investments in services offerings, including outsourcing services for pharmaceutical customers and costs for international expansion, hospital revenue cycle management and data privacy and security. Prescription Solutions The increased Prescription Solutions revenues for 2009 were primarily due to growth in customers served through Medicare Part D prescription drug plans by our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement business, which is the largest customer of this reporting segment. Intersegment revenues eliminated in consolidation were $12.6 billion and $11.0 billion for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prescription Solutions earnings from operations for 2009 increased primarily due to prescription volume growth, strong success under performance-based purchasing arrangements, gains in mail service drug fulfillment and a continuing favorable mix shift to generic pharmaceuticals. LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Introduction We manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy. We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our businesses while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non-cash expenses. The risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses, geographies and customers; our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk-based businesses; and continued productivity improvements in our operating costs. Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations. A majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, liquid, investment-grade, debt securities to improve our overall investment return. We make these investments pursuant to our Board of Directors’ approved investment policy, which focuses on preservation of capital, credit quality, diversification, income and duration. The policy also generally governs return objectives, regulatory limitations, tax implications and risk tolerances. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile. Most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the NAIC. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies. Except in 46 Table of Contents the case of extraordinary dividends, these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, the entire dividend is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval. In 2010, based on the 2009 statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels, the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was $3.2 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $3.2 billion, including $686 million of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2009, our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $4.2 billion, including $2.5 billion of extraordinary dividends. The total dividends received in both 2010 and 2009 included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. In some cases, ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and/or accelerated timing. Our non-regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt, as well as the availability of our committed credit facility, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We generally use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt, or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and/or repurchases of our common stock, depending on market conditions. Results A summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Sources of cash: Cash provided by operating activities $ 6,273 $ 5,625 $ 4,238 Sales of investments 2,593 4,040 5,568 Maturities of investments 3,105 2,675 3,030 Proceeds from customer funds administered 974 204 0 Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, net 930 0 0 Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt 747 0 2,981 Interest rate swap termination 0 513 0 Other 299 342 1,770 Total sources of cash 14,921 13,399 17,587 Uses of cash: Purchases of investments (7,855 ) (6,466 ) (9,251 ) Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed and disposition (2,304 ) (486 ) (3,813 ) Retirement of long-term debt (1,583 ) (1,350 ) (500 ) Common stock repurchases (2,517 ) (1,801 ) (2,684 ) Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (878 ) (739 ) (791 ) Dividends paid (449 ) (36 ) (37 ) Repayments of commercial paper, net 0 (99 ) (1,346 ) Other (12 ) (48 ) (604 ) Total uses of cash (15,598 ) (11,025 ) (19,026 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash $ (677 ) $ 2,374 $ (1,439 ) 47 Table of Contents 2010 Cash Flows Compared to 2009 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $648 million, or 12%, for 2010. Factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings, an acceleration of certain 2011 premium payments, and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the Medicare Part D program and payment for the settlement of the American Medical Association class action litigation related to reimbursement for out-of-network medical services. We anticipate lower cash flows from operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings and the early receipt of certain 2011 premium payments in late 2010. Cash flows used for investing activities increased $4.4 billion, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2010, decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and uses of operating cash to purchase investments. Cash flows used for financing activities decreased $664 million, or 29%, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long-term debt partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock. 2009 Cash Flows Compared To 2008 Cash Flows Cash flows from operating activities increased $1.4 billion, or 33%, primarily due to the payment in 2008 of $573 million, net of taxes, for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices, the 2009 increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk-based products in the public and senior markets businesses, and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with CMS related to Medicare Part D. Additionally, we paid less taxes in 2009 due to tax law changes that took effect in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2008 included payment of 2007 taxes due under the prior tax law, while the 2009 payment did not include prior year amounts. Cash flows used for investing activities decreased $4.1 billion, or 81%, primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2008 and decreases in the usage of cash in 2009 for purchases of investments, which more than offset the 2009 decreases in sales and maturities of investments. Cash flows used for financing activities increased $1.7 billion due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2008 and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in 2008. These items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in 2009 and the 2009 proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalent and available-for-sale investment balances of $25.7 billion included $9.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $974 million was held by non-regulated entities), $16.1 billion of debt securities and $516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity. The use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies, primarily used in valuing our Level 3 equity securities, may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments. Due to the subjective nature of these assumptions, the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.5 billion bank credit facility, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of our fair value measurements. Our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 2.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2010. Included in the debt securities balance are $2.7 billion of 48 Table of Contents state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties. We do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor (neither indirect through the guarantees, nor direct through investment in the guarantor). Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is “AA” as of December 31, 2010. Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity In addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows: Commercial Paper. We maintain a commercial paper program, which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt through third-party broker-dealers. The commercial paper program is supported by the $2.5 billion bank credit facility described below. We had $930 million of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Our issuance of commercial paper in 2010 was to maintain ample liquidity at the holding company level. Bank Credit Facility. We have a $2.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility with 23 banks, which matures in May 2012. This facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2010. The interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on LIBOR plus a spread. As of December 31, 2010, the annual interest rate on this facility, had it been drawn, would have ranged from 0.5% to 0.7%. Our bank credit facility contains various covenants, including requiring us to maintain a debt-to-total-capital ratio below 50%. Our debt-to-total-capital ratio, calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders’ equity, was 30.1% and 32.1% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2010. Debt Issuance. In October 2010, we issued $750 million in senior unsecured notes under our February 2008 S-3 shelf registration statement. The issuance included $450 million of 3.875% fixed-rate notes due October 2020 and $300 million of 5.700% fixed-rate notes due October 2040. We intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. Credit Ratings. Our credit ratings at December 31, 2010 were as follows: Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch (a) A.M. Best Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Ratings Outlook Senior unsecured debt Baa1 Stable A- Stable A- Negative bbb+ Stable Commercial paper P-2 n/a A-2 n/a F1 n/a AMB-2 n/a (a) On January 12, 2011, Fitch updated their ratings outlook on our senior unsecured debt to “stable”. The availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, credit ratings, debt covenants and other contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions. For example, a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital. We have therefore adopted strategies and actions to maintain financial flexibility and mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital. Share Repurchases. Under our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, subject to certain preset parameters. In February 2010, the Board renewed and increased our share repurchase program, and authorized us to repurchase up to 120 million shares of our common stock. In 2010, we repurchased 76 million shares at an average price of approximately $33 per share and an aggregate cost of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2010, we had Board authorization to purchase up to an additional 48 million shares of our common stock. 49 Table of Contents Debt Tender. In February 2010, we completed cash tender offers for $775 million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes. We believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost. We used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes. Dividends. In May 2010, our Board of Directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends are at the discretion of the Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. Prior to May 2010, our policy had been to pay an annual dividend.

For variable-rate obligations, we used the rates in place as of December 31, 2010 to estimate all remaining contractual payments. See Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail. (b) Includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services, including agreements that are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty. Excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and excludes liabilities to the extent recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010. (c) Estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts and health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay benefits to be incurred in future years. Under our reinsurance arrangement with OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (OneAmerica) these amounts are payable by OneAmerica, but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay. We have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from OneAmerica in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (d) Since the timing of future settlements is uncertain, the long-term portion has been classified as “Thereafter.” 50 Table of Contents (e) Includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions, certain employee benefit programs, charitable contributions related to the PacifiCare acquisition, interest rate swaps and various other long-term liabilities. Due to uncertainty regarding payment timing, obligations for employee benefit programs, charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as “Thereafter”. (f) Includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments. We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources; however, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations. This includes internal development of new products, programs and technology applications, and may include acquisitions. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of December 31, 2010, we were not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements (as that phrase is defined by SEC rules applicable to this report) which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS We have determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to our operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Medical Costs Each reporting period, we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes. We develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt, claim backlogs, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, medical care utilization and other medical cost trends, membership volume and demographics, benefit plan changes, and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service. We estimate liabilities for physician, hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions. Each period, we re-examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs 51 Table of Contents is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2010, 2009 and 2008, included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of $800 million, $310 million and $230 million, respectively. In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent 36-month period. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. For months prior to the most recent three months, we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months. For the most recent three months, we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including, but not limited to, pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. This approach is consistently applied from period to period. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods, generally periods prior to the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2010: Completion Factors Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs Payable (in millions) (0.75)% $ 186 (0.50) 124 (0.25) 62 0.25 (61 ) 0.50 (122 ) 0.75 (183 ) Medical cost PMPM trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of December 31, 2010: Medical Cost PMPM Trend Increase (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)in Medical Costs Payable (in millions) 3% $ 366 2 244 1 122 (1) (122 ) (2) (244 ) (3) (366 ) The analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims. Our estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2010, developed using consistently applied actuarial methods. Management believes 52 Table of Contents the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2010; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2010 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance, 2010 net earnings would increase or decrease by $51 million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by $0.05 per share. The current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate. We use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation. These include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals. Through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals, we emphasize preventive health care, appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards, education and closing gaps in care. We believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful. However, other factors including competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers, major epidemics, and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation. Because of the narrow operating margins of our risk-based products, changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results. Revenues Revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums. We recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services. Customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services, as recorded in our records. Employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears. Each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing. We estimate and adjust the current period’s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly. Our estimates are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information. Beginning in 2011, premium revenue subject to the medical loss ratio rebates of the Health Reform Legislation will be recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract, if that amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated premium will be revised each period to reflect current experience. We revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model, which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. We and other health care providers collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators. See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these audits. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill. Goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. To determine whether 53 Table of Contents goodwill is impaired, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step of the test, the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would proceed to step two of the test. In step two of the test, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is the excess, if any, of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date, goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance. We calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital requirements and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value, and discount rates. Where available and appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test. We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of January 1, 2011, which considered our business realignment, and determined that other than the $172 million impairment related to certain of Ingenix’s businesses, no goodwill impairment existed as of December 31, 2010. Although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units, there is uncertainty inherent in those projections. That uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in Item 1, “Business — Government Regulation”. For additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could affect our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Part I. Intangible assets. Finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (e.g., membership lists, customer contracts and trademarks). We do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment would be recorded. We calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets. We consider many factors, including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows. There were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year. Investments As of December 31, 2010, we had investments with a carrying value of $16.8 billion, primarily held in marketable debt securities. Our investments are principally classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses, net of income tax effects, as a separate component in shareholders’ equity. We continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments. As of December 31, 2010, our investments had gross unrealized gains of $527 million and gross unrealized losses of $81 million. We evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the 54 Table of Contents security before recovery of the entire amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other causes, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. For equity securities, we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security’s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period. If we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term, we recognize the impairment in net earnings. New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. We manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limit our investments to U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; mortgage-backed securities; and corporate debt obligations, substantially all of investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. After application of the valuation allowances, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. According to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We have established an estimated liability for federal, state and non-U.S. income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under U.S. GAAP. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. The significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year. A hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on our 2010 earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by $74 million. Contingent Liabilities Because of the nature of our businesses, we are routinely involved in various disputes, legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations. We record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters. Our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel, if appropriate, and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage, if any, for such matters. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions. 55 Table of Contents LEGAL MATTERS A description of our legal proceedings is included in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference in this report. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base. As of December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our Golden Rule Financial Corporation life and annuity business in 2005. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery. Currently, the reinsurer is rated by A.M. Best as “A.” As of December 31, 2010, there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market risks are exposures to (a) changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt and (b) changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments. As of December 31, 2010, $9.1 billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may materially impact our investment income. Also, $7.1 billion of our debt as of December 31, 2010 was at interest rates that vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts. The fair value of certain of our fixed-rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, $16.3 billion of our investments was fixed-rate debt securities and $4.0 billion of our debt was fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices, as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense. Our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments. Additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 56 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% or 2% as of December 31, 2010 on our investment income and interest expense per annum, and the fair value of our financial investments and debt (in millions): Increase (Decrease) in Market Interest Rate InvestmentIncome PerAnnum (a) InterestExpense PerAnnum (a) Fair Value ofFinancialInvestments Fair Value ofDebt 2% $ 182 $ 163 $ (1,177 ) $ (860 ) 1 91 82 (602 ) (471 ) (1) (10 ) (21 ) 613 560 (2) nm nm 1,227 1,240 nm = not meaningful (a) Given the low absolute level of short-term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2010, the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full 1% point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero. As of December 31, 2010, we had $516 million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds, a portion of which were invested in various public and non-public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies. Market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments. 57 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:29:24.259600
