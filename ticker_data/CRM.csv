1108524,CRM,"Salesforce, Inc.",2015,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.OverviewWe are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have since expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions, enhanced features, platform capabilities and a new analytics solution through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis.Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into “customer companies” by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. With our six core cloud service offerings—Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Communities Cloud, Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform—customers have the tools they need to build a next generation customer success platform. Key elements of our strategy include:•strengthening our market-leading solutions;•extending distribution into new and high-growth categories;•expanding strategic relationships with our existing customers;•pursuing new customers;•reducing attrition;•building our business in top software markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help add customers; and•encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms.We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates.To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the announcement of our Analytics Cloud and Community Cloud, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.30Table of ContentsWe also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2015 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2016. Our operating loss for fiscal 2015 was $145.6 million compared to $286.1 million during the same period a year ago. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between nine and ten percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, which is consistent with the attrition rate as of January 31, 2014. We expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 51 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015 and 53 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2015, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2015.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2015. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.31Table of ContentsProfessional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below.Revenue by Cloud Service OfferingWe are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015Sales Cloud $2,443.0Service Cloud 1,320.2Salesforce1 Platform and Other 745.3Marketing Cloud 505.3Total $5,013.8Subscription and support revenues from Analytics Cloud and Communities Cloud were not significant for fiscal 2015. Analytics Cloud revenue is included with Salesforce1 Platform and Other in the table above. Communities Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce1 Platform and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased.In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2015, based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our core service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce1 Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering, and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful.Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. We estimate that for fiscal 2016, subscription and support revenues from the Sales Cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenue, and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on Sales Cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings.32Table of ContentsSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2015 in comparison to nearly 74 percent during fiscal 2014. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is historically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): April 30, 2014 July 31, 2014 October 31, 2014 January 31, 2015Fiscal 2015 Accounts receivable, net$684,155 $834,323 $794,590 $1,905,506Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent2,324,615 2,352,904 2,223,977 3,321,449Operating cash flow (1)473,087 245,893 122,511 332,223Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure4.8 bn 5.0 bn 5.4 bn 5.7 bn April 30,2013 July 31,2013 October 31,2013 January 31,2014Fiscal 2014 Accounts receivable, net$502,609 $599,543 $604,045 $1,360,837Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent1,733,160 1,789,648 1,734,619 2,522,115Operating cash flow (1)283,189 183,183 137,859 271,238Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure3.6 bn 3.8 bn 4.2 bn 4.5 bn April 30,2012 July 31,2012 October 31,2012 January 31,2013Fiscal 2013 Accounts receivable, net$371,395 $446,917 $418,590 $872,634Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent1,334,716 1,337,184 1,291,703 1,862,995Operating cash flow (1)213,212 136,197 105,915 281,573Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure2.7 bn 2.8 bn 3.0 bn 3.5 bn(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. 33Table of ContentsUnbilled Deferred Revenue, a Non-GAAP MeasureThe deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $5.7 billion as of January 31, 2015 and approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer.Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data center capacity in the future. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies.Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.34Table of ContentsWe plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters.Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.During fiscal 2015, we recognized stock-based expense of $564.8 million. As of January 31, 2015, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years was $1.4 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $556.6 million during fiscal 2016; $411.6 million during fiscal 2017; $288.9 million during fiscal 2018; $127.4 million during fiscal 2019 and $0.5 million during fiscal 2020. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2015 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:•there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•the service has been or is being provided to the customer;•the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.35Table of ContentsSubscription and Support RevenuesSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services and Other RevenuesThe majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price.We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter.Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.36Table of ContentsDuring the fiscal 2015, we deferred $320.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $257.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $265.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $194.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $388.2 million at January 31, 2015 and $324.9 million at January 31, 2014.Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs. We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (“ASC 350”), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard.Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition.We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings;•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and•discount rates.37Table of ContentsUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Stock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The fair value of each option or ESPP share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based expense in the period of change. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include:•The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period;•The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights;•The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights; and•The probability of performance conditions, if any, that affect the vesting of certain awards being achieved. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest.Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Strategic Investments. We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately-held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately-held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available data. 38Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Revenues: Subscription and support $5,013,764 $3,824,542 $2,868,808Professional services and other 359,822 246,461 181,387Total revenues 5,373,586 4,071,003 3,050,195Cost of revenues (1)(2): Subscription and support 924,638 711,880 494,187Professional services and other 364,632 256,548 189,392Total cost of revenues 1,289,270 968,428 683,579Gross profit 4,084,316 3,102,575 2,366,616Operating expenses (1)(2): Research and development 792,917 623,798 429,479Marketing and sales 2,757,096 2,168,132 1,614,026General and administrative 679,936 596,719 433,821Total operating expenses 4,229,949 3,388,649 2,477,326Loss from operations (145,633) (286,074) (110,710)Investment income 10,038 10,218 19,562Interest expense (73,237) (77,211) (30,948)Gain on sales of land and building improvements 15,625 0 0Other expense (19,878) (4,868) (5,698)Loss before benefit from (provision for) income taxes (213,085) (357,935) (127,794)Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (49,603) 125,760 (142,651)Net loss $(262,688) $(232,175) $(270,445)(1) Cost of revenues and marketing and sales expenses include the following amounts related to amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Cost of revenues $90,300 $109,356 $77,249Marketing and sales 64,673 37,179 10,922(2) Cost of revenues and operating expenses include the following amounts related to stock-based expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Cost of revenues $53,812 $45,608 $33,757Research and development 121,193 107,420 76,333Marketing and sales 286,410 258,571 199,284General and administrative 103,350 91,681 69,97639Table of ContentsRevenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Americas $3,868,329 $2,899,837 $2,123,736Europe 984,919 741,220 525,304Asia Pacific 520,338 429,946 401,155 $5,373,586 $4,071,003 $3,050,195Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 94 percent, 96 percent and 94 percent for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

On a constant currency basis, total revenues grew 33 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $5.0 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $3.8 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 31 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015, including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014, which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013. Additionally, volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers contributed to the increase in subscription and support revenues. Our attrition rate, which is consistent with the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped maintain our attrition rate. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. Changes in the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $113.4 million, or 46 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015, including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014, which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013.Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,505.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $1,171.2 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $334.1 million, or 29 percent. The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2015 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $31.5 million compared to the same period a year ago. We expect revenues outside of the Americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2016 by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar and British pound.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $122.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $100.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $29.9 million in professional and outside services, an increase of $18.8 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $44.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment, offset by a decrease of $19.1 million in amortization of purchased intangibles. We have increased our headcount by 30 percent since January 31, 2014 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2015 by $4.8 million as compared to $10.1 million during the same period a year ago, primarily due to the impact of including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal 2015, as described above, offset by an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.Research and Development.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $132.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of of $13.8 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $14.8 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 25 percent since January 31, 2014 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to add employees and invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.Marketing and Sales.

Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $73.2 million for fiscal 2015 and was $77.2 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 0.75% convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015. These notes fully matured on January 15, 2015. Gain on sales of land and building improvementsDuring fiscal 2015, we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate, including a portion of our perpetual parking rights, in San Francisco, California. We recognized a gain of $15.6 million during fiscal 2015, net of closing costs, as a result of this activity. Other expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2015 2014 Other expense $(19,878) $(4,868) $(15,010)Other expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, costs associated with real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt. The increase in other expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to losses totaling $10.3 million related to the extinguishment of the 0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders. 44Table of ContentsBenefit from (provision for) income taxes.

We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the U.S., which was partially offset by tax benefits from current year losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions.We recorded a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014.We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2014 and 2013Revenues.

The increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to fiscal 2013. We have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped reduce our attrition rates.

Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2014 2013 Interest expense $(77,211) $(30,948) $(46,263)Percent of total revenues (2)% (1)% Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, term loan and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $77.2 million for fiscal 2014 and was $30.9 million for fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the March 2013 issuance of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes, the $300.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in June 2013.Benefit from (provision for) Income Taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2014 2013 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $125,760 $(142,651) $268,411Effective tax rate 35% (112)% 47Table of ContentsWe reported a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014.We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets.We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion, which excludes restricted cash of $115.0 million, and accounts receivable of $1.9 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion during fiscal 2015 and $875.5 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts.Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings.As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter has become our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2015 increased $298.2 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, loss on conversions of convertible senior notes, stock-based expenses and the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was $698.4 million during fiscal 2015 and $2.4 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 primarily related to capital expenditures, including new office build-outs, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2015 decreased by $1.7 billion over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisitions of ExactTarget, Inc. and EdgeSpring, Inc. during fiscal 2014, offset by cash proceeds from sales of land and building improvements totaling $223.2 million and cash acquired of $38.1 million from business combinations during fiscal 2015. Additionally, we made deposits totaling $126.4 million for the purchase of building and land during fiscal 2015. 48Table of ContentsNet cash used in financing activities was $310.5 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1.6 billion during the same period a year ago. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of $568.9 million in principal payments on our 0.75% convertible senior notes, $70.7 million of principal payments on capital leases and $285.0 million of payments on our term loan, offset by $309.0 million from proceeds from equity plans and $297.3 million from our revolving credit facility. Net cash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 changed $1.9 billion from the same period a year ago primarily due to $1.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and related hedge transactions during fiscal 2014, and an increase of $562.9 million in principal payments on our 0.75% convertible senior notes during fiscal 2015.In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “0.75% Senior Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “0.75% Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “0.75% Warrants”). On January 15, 2015, the 0.75% Senior Notes matured. Upon maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes, we delivered cash up to the remaining principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes. As of January 31, 2015, there is no remaining principal balance of the 0.75% Senior Notes outstanding. As a result of the conversions and maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its rights on the 0.75% Note Hedges, and the 0.75% Note Hedges expired. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.75% Warrant counterparties to amend and settle the 0.75% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in April 2015. As a result, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 13.3 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.75% Warrants.In March 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018 (the “0.25% Senior Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “0.25% Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “0.25% Warrants”). The 0.25% Senior Notes will mature on April 1, 2018, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.25% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders’ option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2015. Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2015. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2015, and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet.In July 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provided for a $300.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan bore interest at our option under either a LIBOR-based formula or a base rate formula, each as set forth in the Prior Credit Agreement. On October 6, 2014, we repaid the Term Loan in full and terminated the Prior Credit Agreement. In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in October 2019. Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our Term Loan. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. We may also prepay the borrowings under the Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed.Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option at either a base rate formula or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears quarterly.The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2015.49Table of ContentsThe weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.7% for the period beginning October 6, 2014 and ended January 31, 2015. As of January 31, 2015, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $300.0 million. In August 2014, we sold approximately 3.7 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in San Francisco for a total of $72.5 million. Separately, in September 2014, we sold approximately 1.5 net acres of our undeveloped real estate for a total of $125.0 million. We have 8.8 net acres remaining for sale as of January 31, 2015. In February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (“50 Fremont”). We acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in San Francisco. As of January 31, 2015, we were leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. See Note 14, “Subsequent Event” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $629.3 million. To pay for 50 Fremont, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.As of January 31, 2015, we have a total of $63.8 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2015, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): Contractual ObligationsPayments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 YearsCapital lease obligations, including interest$651,344 $104,825 $232,241 $314,278 $0Operating lease obligations: Facilities space2,027,140 178,552 351,882 372,336 1,124,370 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures251,834 110,995 139,854 985 00.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest1,160,422 2,875 6,109 1,151,438 0Revolving Credit Facility300,000 0 0 300,000 0Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility335,824 1,777 37,984 43,546 252,517Contractual commitments18,823 1,316 2,598 14,909 0 $4,745,387 $400,340 $770,668 $2,197,492 $1,376,887The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2015, $125.3 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progress - leased facility, which is included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 714,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $560.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases.50Table of ContentsSubsequent to January 31, 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont. As of January 31, 2015, we had been leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of 50 Fremont (see Note 14 “Subsequent Event” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The lease, which was signed in January 2012, is reflected above under Operating lease obligations, and the commitment totals $238.5 million. The operating lease commitment is as follows: $16.1 million during fiscal 2016; $16.6 million during fiscal 2017; $17.1 million during fiscal 2018; $17.6 million during fiscal 2019; $18.1 million during fiscal 2020; and $153.0 thereafter. Beginning in the quarter ending April 30, 2015, this commitment will be removed from operating lease obligations.During fiscal 2015 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.New Accounting PronouncementIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”) which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commissions balances. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net incomeWe use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period.We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. 51Table of Contents•Stock-Based Expense. The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.•Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.•Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company’s $575.0 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010 and the Company’s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rates were approximately 5.86% for the notes issued in January 2010 and approximately 2.53% for the notes issued in March 2013, while the coupon interest rates were 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance.•Non-Cash Gains/Losses on Conversions of Debt. Upon settlement of the Company’s convertible senior notes, we attribute the fair value of the consideration transferred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes. The difference between the fair value of consideration attributed to the liability component and the carrying value of the liability as of settlement date is recorded as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash gain/loss provides investors an enhanced view of the company’s operational performance.•Gain on sales of land and building improvements. The Company views the non-operating gains associated with the sales of the land and building improvements to be a discrete item. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance. •Income Tax Effects and Adjustments. During fiscal 2014, the Company’s non-GAAP tax provision excluded the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal year’s ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items included, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Company’s operational performance. During fiscal 2015, the Company began to compute and utilize a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these items can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the impact of the following items: Stock-Based Expenses, Amortization of Purchased Intangibles, Amortization of Debt Discount, Gains/Losses on Conversions of Debt, and Gains/Losses on sales of land and building improvements. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and takes into account other factors including the Company’s current tax structure, its existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. The non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2015 is 36.5%. The Company intends to re-evaluate this long-term rate on an annual basis or if any significant events that may materially affect this long-term rate occur. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, for example, significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the Company operates.We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues.52Table of ContentsWe define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses.Non-GAAP earnings per shareManagement uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation.We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding.Limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position.We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, “gross profit,” “loss from operations,” “net income (loss)” and “net income (loss) per share” for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Non-GAAP gross profit GAAP gross profit $4,084,316 $3,102,575 $2,366,616Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 90,300 109,356 77,249Stock-based expenses 53,812 45,608 33,757Non-GAAP gross profit $4,228,428 $3,257,539 $2,477,622 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Non-GAAP operating profit GAAP loss from operations $(145,633) $(286,074) $(110,710)Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 154,973 146,535 88,171Stock-based expenses 564,765 503,280 379,350Non-GAAP operating profit $574,105 $363,741 $356,81153Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Non-GAAP net income GAAP net loss $(262,688) $(232,175) $(270,445)Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 154,973 146,535 88,171Stock-based expenses 564,765 503,280 379,350Amortization of debt discount, net 36,575 46,728 23,837Loss on conversion of debt 10,326 214 0Less: Gain on sales of land and building improvements (15,625) 0 0Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (146,741) (242,729) 21,629Non-GAAP net income $341,585 $221,853 $242,542 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 2014 2013Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share GAAP diluted loss per share $(0.42) $(0.39) $(0.48)Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.24 0.23 0.15Stock-based expenses 0.87 0.79 0.64Amortization of debt discount, net 0.06 0.07 0.04Loss on conversion of debt 0.02 0.00 0.00Less: Gain on sales of land and building improvements (0.02) 0.00 0.00Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (0.23) (0.35) 0.06Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.52 $0.35 $0.41Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 651,534 635,688 596,280Non-GAAP operating profit for the year ended January 31, 2015 was $574.1 million and $363.7 million for the same period a year ago, an improvement of $210.4 million or 58 percent. During fiscal 2015 we remained focused on improving non-GAAP operating profit and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2016. The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the GAAP earnings/loss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Supplemental Diluted Sharecount Information (in thousands): 2015 2014 2013Weighted-average shares outstanding for GAAP basic earnings per share 624,148 597,613 564,896Effect of dilutive securities: Convertible senior notes 5,381 14,550 11,360Warrants associated with the convertible senior note hedges 9,536 9,658 5,132Employee stock awards 12,469 13,867 14,892Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 651,534 635,688 596,28054Table of Contents Supplemental Tax Expense (Benefit) Information: As described above, beginning in February 2014, which was the start of our fiscal 2015, we changed the methodology used to calculate our non-GAAP tax expense. We have computed and are utilizing a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5 percent for fiscal 2015. We moved to this long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items. As a result, we believe that starting in fiscal 2015, providing a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of tax expense (benefit) to the comparable GAAP measure is not appropriate given our new methodology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded for GAAP purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a partial valuation allowance release, primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. The increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the GAAP valuation allowance and the Company’s increasing acquisition activities. The following table for fiscal 2014 and 2013 reflects the calculation of our non-GAAP tax expense: Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Non-GAAP tax expense (in thousands): 2014 2013GAAP Tax Expense (Benefit) (125,760) 142,651GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjustments - tax effects of: Stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount, net (1) 229,277 169,501Deferred tax asset partial valuation (reserve) release (2) 25,048 (186,806)State income tax credits not benefited (3) 5,325 0Acquisitions-related costs (4) (19,708) 0Other, net (5) 2,787 (4,324)Total Adjustments 242,729 (21,629)Non-GAAP Tax Expense 116,969 121,022(1) The Company excluded stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and amortization of debt discount, net, in reporting its non-GAAP net income. Accordingly, the Company excluded the related tax effects of these items. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction.(2) During fiscal 2013, the Company evaluated both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets and determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence due to the cumulative GAAP loss in recent years and forecasted future GAAP losses. As a result, a valuation allowance was established against a significant portion of the deferred tax assets in Q3 fiscal 2013. However, a valuation allowance would not be necessary on a non-GAAP basis given the Company’s non-GAAP operating income. As a result, the Company excluded its GAAP valuation allowance recorded during the period when computing its non-GAAP tax expense.(3) During fiscal 2014, California mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state, which significantly reduced the Company’s California income tax expense. Accordingly, for computing non-GAAP tax expense, the Company did notrecognize tax benefits related to certain California research and development tax credits as the Company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered California income tax expense.(4) During fiscal 2014, the Company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its non-GAAP tax expense. The majority of this adjustment was attributable to non-cash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles. This non-cash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these non-cash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period, but were made for the Company’s long term benefit over multiple periods. The remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions, which amount was not material. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction.(5) Other, net included multiple items that were immaterial either on an individual basis or an aggregate basis.55Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion at January 31, 2015. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2015 could result in a $13.5 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.As of January 31, 2015, we had restricted cash totaling $115.0 million that was held in a money market account, which is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates.At January 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $8.8 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the “0.25% Senior Notes”) (collectively the “Notes”). Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. For the 0.25% Senior Notes, the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes.The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January 31, 2015. The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2015 was $1.3 billion. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which was $110.87.In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in October 2019 (the “Credit Facility”). Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility.56Table of ContentsBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate formula, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. By entering into the Credit Agreement, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 1.7% for the period beginning October 6, 2014 and ended January 31, 2015. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, therefore our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. Our portfolio consists of investments in approximately 100 companies, with our investments in these companies ranging from $0.2 million to $40.0 million. As of January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2014 the carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies was $158.0 million and $77.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $280.0 million as of January 31, 2015. 57Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:33:00.166777
1108524,CRM,"Salesforce, Inc.",2016,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.OverviewWe are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, solutions, features and platform capabilities.Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things integration and our professional cloud services, provide the next-generation platform of enterprise applications and services to enable customer success. Key elements of our strategy include:•strengthening our market-leading solutions;•expanding strategic relationships with customers; •extending distribution into new and high-growth product categories;•expanding our world-class sales organization;•reducing customer attrition;•building our business in top software markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help add customers; and•encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms.We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates.To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the announcement of our Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, and Internet of Things, or IoT, Cloud, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and App Cloud core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.32Table of ContentsWe also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis in some future quarters. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2016 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017. Our operating margin for fiscal 2016 was $114.9 million compared to a $145.6 million loss during the same period a year ago. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, which is favorable compared to the nine to ten percent attrition rate as of January 31, 2015. We expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 49 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 and 51 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2016, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed several acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, our business operates in one operating segment because all of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2016. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.33Table of ContentsProfessional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below.Revenue by Cloud Service OfferingWe are providing the information below on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following by core service offering (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2015 Variance- PercentSales Cloud$2,699.0 $2,443.0 10%Service Cloud1,817.8 1,320.2 38%App Cloud and Other1,034.7 745.3 39%Marketing Cloud654.1 505.3 29%Total$6,205.6 $5,013.8 Subscription and support revenues from the Analytics Cloud and Communities Cloud were not significant for fiscal 2016. Since the launch of IoT Cloud in September 2015, we have been piloting this offering with several enterprises. Analytics Cloud revenue is included with App Cloud and Other in the table above. Communities Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or App Cloud and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2016 and 2015, based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our App Cloud to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful.Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement. We estimate that for fiscal 2017, subscription and support revenues from the Sales Cloud service offering will continue to be the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues, and foreign currency will continue to have a more pronounced impact on Sales Cloud subscription and support revenues than revenues from our other cloud service offerings.34Table of ContentsSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2016, which is consistent with fiscal 2015. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): April 30,2015 July 31,2015 October 31,2015 January 31,2016Fiscal 2016 Accounts receivable, net$926,381 $1,067,799 $1,060,726 $2,496,165Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent3,056,820 3,034,991 2,846,510 4,291,553Operating cash flow (1)730,857 304,411 117,907 459,410Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure6.0 bn 6.2 bn 6.7 bn 7.1 bn April 30, 2014 July 31, 2014 October 31, 2014 January 31, 2015Fiscal 2015 Accounts receivable, net$684,155 $834,323 $794,590 $1,905,506Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent2,324,615 2,352,904 2,223,977 3,321,449Operating cash flow (1)473,087 245,893 122,511 332,223Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure4.8 bn 5.0 bn 5.4 bn 5.7 bn April 30, 2013 July 31, 2013 October 31, 2013 January 31, 2014Fiscal 2014 Accounts receivable, net$502,609 $599,543 $604,045 $1,360,837Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent1,733,160 1,789,648 1,734,619 2,522,115Operating cash flow (1)283,189 183,183 137,859 271,238Unbilled deferred revenue, a non-GAAP measure3.6 bn 3.8 bn 4.2 bn 4.5 bn(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. 35Table of ContentsUnbilled Deferred Revenue, a Non-GAAP MeasureThe GAAP deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is a non-GAAP operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $7.1 billion as of January 31, 2016 and approximately $5.7 billion as of January 31, 2015. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer.Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies.Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.36Table of ContentsWe plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters.Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.During fiscal 2016, we recognized stock-based expense of $593.6 million. As of January 31, 2016, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $1.6 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $626.1 million during fiscal 2017; $481.0 million during fiscal 2018; $340.6 million during fiscal 2019 and $157.1 million during fiscal 2020. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2016 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:•there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•the service has been or is being provided to the customer;•the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.37Table of ContentsSubscription and Support RevenuesSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services and Other RevenuesThe majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price.We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter.Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.During fiscal 2016, we deferred $380.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $319.1 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $320.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $257.6 38Table of Contentsmillion to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $449.1 million at January 31, 2016 and $388.2 million at January 31, 2015.Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs. We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (“ASC 350”), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard.Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings;•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and•discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill and Intangibles. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.39Table of ContentsValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Strategic Investments. We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (“ASC 323”), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost and presented in the consolidated balance sheet. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the requirements of ASC 323 to account for such investments.We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee’s financial metrics, the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investee’s liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment. 40Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Revenues: Subscription and support $6,205,599 $5,013,764 $3,824,542Professional services and other 461,617 359,822 246,461Total revenues 6,667,216 5,373,586 4,071,003Cost of revenues (1)(2): Subscription and support 1,188,967 924,638 711,880Professional services and other 465,581 364,632 256,548Total cost of revenues 1,654,548 1,289,270 968,428Gross profit 5,012,668 4,084,316 3,102,575Operating expenses (1)(2): Research and development 946,300 792,917 623,798Marketing and sales 3,239,824 2,757,096 2,168,132General and administrative 748,238 679,936 596,719Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont (36,617) 0 0Total operating expenses 4,897,745 4,229,949 3,388,649Income (loss) from operations 114,923 (145,633) (286,074)Investment income 15,341 10,038 10,218Interest expense (72,485) (73,237) (77,211)Other expense (1) (15,292) (19,878) (4,868)Gain on sales of land and building improvements 21,792 15,625 0Income (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes 64,279 (213,085) (357,935)Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (111,705) (49,603) 125,760Net loss $(47,426) $(262,688) $(232,175)(1) Cost of revenues and marketing and sales expenses include the following amounts related to amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Cost of revenues $80,918 $90,300 $109,356Marketing and sales 77,152 64,673 37,179Other non-operating expense 3,636 0 0(2) Cost of revenues and operating expenses include the following amounts related to stock-based expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Cost of revenues $69,443 $53,812 $45,608Research and development 129,434 121,193 107,420Marketing and sales 289,152 286,410 258,571General and administrative 105,599 103,350 91,68141Table of ContentsRevenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Americas $4,910,745 $3,868,329 $2,899,837Europe 1,162,808 984,919 741,220Asia Pacific 593,663 520,338 429,946 $6,667,216 $5,373,586 $4,071,003Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 95 percent, 94 percent and 96 percent for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

On a constant currency basis, total revenues grew 27 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $6.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, compared to $5.0 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 24 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our attrition rate, which is favorable compared to the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our attrition rate. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $461.6 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, compared to $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $101.8 million, or 28 percent.Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1.8 billion, or 26 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, compared to $1.5 billion, or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $251.2 million, or 17 percent. The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2016 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $170.5 million compared to fiscal 2015. We expect revenues outside of the Americas to continue to be negatively impacted in fiscal 2017 by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen and Australian dollar. 44Table of ContentsCost of Revenues.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $127.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $15.6 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $137.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $40.6 million in professional and outside services, an increase in depreciation of equipment and an increase in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $9.4 million in amortization of purchased intangibles. We have increased our headcount by 34 percent since January 31, 2015 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2016 by $4.0 million as compared to $4.8 million during the same period a year ago. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.Research and Development.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $114.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $18.2 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 16 percent since January 31, 2015 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.

Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2016 2015 Other expense $(15,292) $(19,878) $4,586Other expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as strategic investments fair market adjustments, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt. The decrease in other expense for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to losses totaling $10.3 million related to the extinguishment of the 0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders in fiscal 2015.Gain on sales of land and building improvements. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2016 2015 Gain on sales of land and building improvements $21,792 $15,625 $6,167Gain on sales of land and building improvements consists of the gain the company recognized from sales of undeveloped real estate and a portion of associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California. Gain on sales of land and building improvements, net of closing costs, was $21.8 million for fiscal 2016 and was $15.6 million during the same period a year ago. Provision for income taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2016 2015 Provision for income taxes $(111,705) $(49,603) $(62,102)Effective tax rate 174% (23)% We reported a tax provision of $111.7 million on a pretax income of $64.3 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for the fiscal 2016. We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current tax expense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock.We recorded a tax provision of $49.6 million with a pretax loss of $213.1 million, which resulted in an negative effective tax rate of 23 percent for fiscal 2015. We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome. We will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years. Due to our valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods.47Table of ContentsFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2015 and 2014Revenues.

On a constant currency basis, total revenues grew 33 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $5.0 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $3.8 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2014, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 31 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015, including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014, which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013. Additionally, volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers contributed to the increase in subscription and support revenues. Our attrition rate, which was consistent with the prior year, also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. We invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped maintain our attrition rate. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. Changes in the net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $359.8 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, an increase of $113.4 million, or 46 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was primarily attributable to the impact of, in fiscal 2015, including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2014, which only included ExactTarget revenue as of its acquisition date in July 2013.Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1.5 billion, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015, compared to $1.2 billion, or 29 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2014, an increase of $334.1 million, or 29 percent. The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2015 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $31.5 million compared to fiscal 2014. 48Table of ContentsCost of Revenues.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $122.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $100.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $29.9 million in professional and outside services, an increase of $18.8 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $44.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment, offset by a decrease of $19.1 million in amortization of purchased intangibles. We increased our headcount by 30 percent in fiscal 2015 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2015 by $4.8 million as compared to $10.1 million during fiscal 2014, primarily due to the impact of including ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal 2015, as described above, offset by an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. This investment in professional services facilitated the adoption of our service offerings.Research and Development.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $132.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $13.8 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $14.8 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 25 percent in fiscal 2015 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $439.0 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $56.4 million in advertising expenses and event costs, $27.8 million stock-based expense, $5.2 million in professional and outside services and $28.0 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent in fiscal 2015. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. 49Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative.

The increase was primarily due to an increase of $53.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $18.9 million in equipment costs and an increase of $11.7 million in stock-based expense, offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 9 percent in fiscal 2015 as we added personnel to support our growth.Loss from operations.

Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2015 2014 Interest expense $(73,237) $(77,211) $3,974Percent of total revenues (1)% (2)% Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, term loan and revolving credit facility. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $73.2 million for fiscal 2015 and was $77.2 million during fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 0.75% convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015. These notes fully matured on January 15, 2015. Gain on sales of land and building improvements.During fiscal 2015, we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate, including a portion of our perpetual parking rights, in San Francisco, California. We recognized a gain of $15.6 million during fiscal 2015, net of closing costs, as a result of this activity. 50Table of ContentsOther expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2015 2014 Other expense $(19,878) $(4,868) $(15,010)Other expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and losses, costs associated with real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt. The increase in other expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to losses totaling $10.3 million related to the extinguishment of the 0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders. Benefit from (provision for) Income Taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2015 2014 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $(49,603) $125,760 $(175,363)Effective tax rate (23)% 35% We reported a tax provision of $49.6 million on a pretax loss of $213.1 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 23 percent for the fiscal 2015. We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions.We recorded a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets. As a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014.We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion and accounts receivable of $2.5 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion during fiscal 2016 and $1.2 billion during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities were affected by the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on the conversions of convertible senior notes, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, the expense associated with stock-based awards, and specifically for fiscal 2016 gains related to the termination of 50 Fremont lease and the additional sales of our land in Mission Bay; and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts.Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings.As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash 51Table of Contentsflow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016 and $698.4 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 primarily related to capital expenditures, including strategic investments, business combinations, purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of Mission Bay land, the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building. Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 increased by approximately $789.5 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of 50 Fremont land and building and strategic investments. Net cash provided by financing activities was $132.6 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $310.5 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $455.5 million from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash flows used in financing activities during fiscal 2015 changed $443.1 million from the same period a year ago primarily due to $568.9 million payment on convertible senior notes, $285.0 million payment on term loan, offset by $297.3 million proceeds from revolving credit facility and $309.0 million of proceeds from our equity plans. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “0.75% Senior Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “0.75% Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “0.75% Warrants”). On January 15, 2015, the 0.75% Senior Notes matured. Upon maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes, we delivered cash up to the remaining principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes. As a result of the conversions and maturity of the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015, the Company exercised its rights on the 0.75% Note Hedges, and the 0.75% Note Hedges expired. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company entered into agreements with each of the 0.75% Warrant counterparties to amend and settle the 0.75% Warrants prior to their scheduled expiration beginning in April 2015. As a result, the Company issued, in the aggregate, approximately 13.3 million shares to the counterparties to settle, via a net share settlement, the entirety of the 0.75% Warrants.The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders’ option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2016. Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending January 31, 2016.In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in October 2019. Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our Term Loan. In March 2015, we paid down the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings held under the Credit Facility and related interest in full. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement. We may also prepay the borrowings under the Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or prepaid may be reborrowed. As of January 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $0. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option at either a base rate formula or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears quarterly.The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2016.In August 2014, we sold approximately 3.7 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in San Francisco for a total of $72.5 million. Separately, in September 2014, we sold approximately 1.5 net acres of our undeveloped real estate for a total of $125.0 million. In October 2015, we sold approximately 8.8 net acres of undeveloped real estate and the associated perpetual parking 52Table of Contentsrights in San Francisco, California, which were classified as held for sale. The total proceeds from the sale were $157.1 million, of which the Company received $127.1 million during fiscal 2016 and previously received a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of $30.0 million during the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2014.In February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (“50 Fremont”). We acquired 50 Fremont for the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in San Francisco. See Note 4, “Business Combinations” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $637.6 million. To pay for 50 Fremont, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, asset backed securities, mortgage backed securities obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.As of January 31, 2016, we have a total of $81.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2016, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): Contractual ObligationsPayments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 YearsCapital lease obligations, including interest$558,411 $118,820 $238,048 $201,543 $0Operating lease obligations: Facilities space1,986,694 191,879 404,022 391,944 998,849 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures332,153 164,648 167,505 0 00.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest1,157,188 2,875 1,154,313 0 0Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility334,047 16,877 42,658 44,435 230,077Contractual commitments25,177 11,702 7,263 5,964 248 $4,393,670 $506,801 $2,013,809 $643,886 $1,229,174The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2016, $196.7 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation, building in progress - leased facility, which is included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.In April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases.In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $311.0 million over the approximately 12 year term of the agreement, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.During fiscal 2016 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and 53Table of Contentsremain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”), which amended the existing FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts. The FASB deferred the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP for one year. In accordance with the deferral, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material to either our revenue results or our deferred commission balances. In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805)” (“ASU 2015-16”) which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-16 on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize the expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current practice. ASU 2016-02 states that a lessee would recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact to our consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures for Statement of Operations and Sharecount InformationRegulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP free cash flow, and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. We use the below non-GAAP financial measures to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding expenses and benefits that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period.Non-GAAP net incomeWe define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the components described below, which we believe are not reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as we do, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and in better understanding the impact of these items on our gross margin and operating performance. 54Table of Contents•Stock-Based Expense. The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.•Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Acquired Leases. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists, customer relationships and acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.•Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company’s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes due 2018 that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rate was approximately 2.53% for the convertible notes due 2018, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes was 0.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of its core, ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance.•Non-Cash Gains/Losses on Conversion of Debt. Upon settlement of the Company’s convertible senior notes, we attribute the fair value of the consideration transferred to the liability and equity components of the convertible senior notes. The difference between the fair value of consideration attributed to the liability component and the carrying value of the liability as of settlement date is recorded as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash gain/loss provides investors an enhanced view of the company’s operational performance.•Gain on Sales of Land and Building Improvements. The Company views the non-operating gains associated with the sales of the land and building improvements at Mission Bay to be a discrete item. The difference between the cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the land and the building improvements as of the settlement date is recorded as a one-time gain on the statement of operations. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance.•Lease Termination Resulting from Purchase of Office Building. The Company views the non-cash, one-time gain associated with the termination of its lease at 50 Fremont to be a discrete item. Management believes that the exclusion of the gains provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance.•Income Tax Effects and Adjustments. Since fiscal 2015, the Company has utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisitions-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, amortization of debt discount, gains/losses on the sales of land and building improvements, gains/losses on conversions of debt, and termination of office leases. The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the Company’s tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates. This long-term rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix including acquisition activity, or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where the company operates. The Company re-evaluates this long-term rate on an annual basis and, as appropriate, if a significant event materially affects it. Our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP tax provision was 35.5 percent which reflected the related tax impact from the recent Tax Court decision in Altera Corporation’s litigation with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). 55Table of ContentsAdditionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, or as other events occur that are not related to the Company’s core, ongoing operating results, we may exclude the financial results of these events from non-GAAP net income in the period in which such events occur. For example, we could in the future recognize a significant gain or loss in connection with one or more of our strategic investments, which may not be viewed by management as reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. Similarly, the financial effects of significant facilities-related transactions may in the future be excluded from non-GAAP net income in the period in which such events may occur, if they are not viewed by management as reflective of our core, ongoing operating results. Non-GAAP gross profitWe define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues.Non-GAAP operating profitWe define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and gain resulting from termination of our office lease that are included in operating expenses.Non-GAAP earnings per shareManagement uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation.We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding.Non-GAAP free cash flowWe define the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building in progress - leased facilities.Limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measuresA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash flow is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Non-GAAP gross profit GAAP gross profit $5,012,668 $4,084,316 $3,102,575Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 80,918 90,300 109,356Stock-based expenses 69,443 53,812 45,608Non-GAAP gross profit $5,163,029 $4,228,428 $3,257,53956Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Non-GAAP income from operations GAAP income (loss) from operations $114,923 $(145,633) $(286,074)Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 158,070 154,973 146,535Stock-based expenses 593,628 564,765 503,280Less: Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont (36,617) 0 0Non-GAAP operating profit $830,004 $574,105 $363,741 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Non-GAAP net income GAAP net loss $(47,426) $(262,688) $(232,175)Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 158,070 154,973 146,535Amortization of acquired lease intangible 3,636 0 0Stock-based expenses 593,628 564,765 503,280Amortization of debt discount, net 24,504 36,575 46,728Loss on conversion of debt 0 10,326 214Less: Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont (36,617) 0 0Gain on sales of land and building improvements (21,792) (15,625) 0Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (167,221) (146,741) (242,729)Non-GAAP net income $506,782 $341,585 $221,853 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 2015 2014Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share GAAP diluted loss per share (a) $(0.07) $(0.42) $(0.39)Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.23 0.24 0.23Amortization of acquired lease intangible 0.01 0.00 0.00Stock-based expenses 0.88 0.87 0.79Amortization of debt discount, net 0.04 0.06 0.07Loss on conversion of debt 0.00 0.02 0.00Less: Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont (0.05) 0.00 0.00Gain on sales of land and building improvements (0.03) (0.02) 0.00Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (0.26) (0.23) (0.35)Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.75 $0.52 $0.35Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 676,830 651,534 635,688a) Reported GAAP loss per share was calculated using the basic share count. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was calculated using the diluted share count.57Table of ContentsNon-GAAP operating profit for the year ended January 31, 2016 was $830.0 million and $574.1 million for the same period a year ago, an improvement of $255.9 million or 45 percent. During fiscal 2016 we remained focused on improving non-GAAP operating profit and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2017. The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The following table reflects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic share count used in the GAAP earnings/loss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Supplemental Diluted Sharecount Information (in thousands): 2016 2015 2014Weighted-average shares outstanding for GAAP basic earnings per share 661,647 624,148 597,613Effect of dilutive securities (1): Convertible senior notes (2) 1,302 5,381 14,550Warrants associated with the convertible senior note hedges (2) 0 9,536 9,658Employee stock awards 13,881 12,469 13,867Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 676,830 651,534 635,688(1)The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.(2)Upon maturity in fiscal 2015, the convertible 0.75% senior notes and associated warrants were settled. The 0.25% senior notes were not convertible, however, there is a dilutive effect for shares outstanding for the fiscal 2016. Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Free cash flow analysis:2016 2015 2014Operating cash flow GAAP net cash provided by operating activities$1,612,585 $1,173,714 $875,469Less: Capital expenditures(284,476) (290,454) (299,110)Free cash flow$1,328,109 $883,260 $576,359 Supplemental Tax Expense (Benefit) Information: As described above, beginning in February 2014, which was the start of our fiscal 2015, we changed the methodology used to calculate our non-GAAP tax expense. We computed and utilized a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5 percent for fiscal 2015. We moved to this long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items. As a result, we believe that starting in fiscal 2015, providing a tabular reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of tax expense (benefit) to the comparable GAAP measure is not appropriate given our new methodology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we recorded for GAAP purposes a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2014, we recorded a partial valuation allowance release, primarily in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget. The increasing number of tax adjustments reflected below was the result of the GAAP valuation allowance and the Company’s increasing acquisition activities. The following table for fiscal 2014 reflects the calculation of our non-GAAP tax expense:58Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Non-GAAP tax expense (in thousands): 2014GAAP tax benefit $(125,760)GAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments - tax effects of: Stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of debt discount, net (1) 229,277Deferred tax asset partial valuation release 25,048State income tax credits not benefited (2) 5,325Acquisitions-related costs (3) (19,708)Other, net 2,787Total adjustments 242,729Non-GAAP tax expense $116,969(1) The Company excluded stock-based expenses, amortization of purchased intangibles, and amortization of debt discount, net, in reporting its non-GAAP net income. Accordingly, the Company excluded the related tax effects of these items. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction.(2) During fiscal 2014, California mandated a change to the way it apportioned income to the state, which significantly reduced the Company’s California income tax expense. Accordingly, for computing non-GAAP tax expense, the Company did notrecognize tax benefits related to certain California research and development tax credits as the Company believed these credits may not be realized given the lowered California income tax expense.(3) During fiscal 2014, the Company excluded certain tax effects related to acquisitions in computing its non-GAAP tax expense. The majority of this adjustment was attributable to non-cash tax costs associated with the transfer of purchased intangibles. This non-cash tax item was excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these non-cash tax costs were neither made to increase revenue nor directly related to performance in any particular period, but were made for the Company’s long term benefit over multiple periods. The remainder of this adjustment included the tax effects of legal and accounting fees incurred to facilitate transactions, which amount was not material. The related tax effects were computed by applying the relevant statutory tax rate to these items for each respective jurisdiction.59Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion at January 31, 2016. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2016 could result in a $20.9 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.5 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskIn March 2013, we issued the 0.25% Senior Notes. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% Senior Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% Senior Notes.The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% Senior Notes. However, the value of the 0.25% Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January 31, 2016. The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2016 was $1.4 billion. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which was $119.24. In October 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for the $650.0 million Credit Facility that matures in October 2019. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either a base rate formula, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or a LIBOR based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fees are payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2016 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Agreement.60Table of ContentsBy entering into the Credit Agreement, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.We deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, therefore our deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.Our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 150 privately held companies, primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. We invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million, with 14 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. As of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $504.5 million and $158.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $714.1 million and $280.0 million as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015, respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 61Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:59.090421
1108524,CRM,"Salesforce, Inc.",2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.OverviewWe are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities.Our core mission is to help our customers transform by empowering them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, analytics, application development, Internet of Things (“IoT”) integration and collaborative productivity tools - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include:•extend existing service offerings;•cross sell and upsell; •expand into new horizontal markets;•target vertical markets and industries;•extend go-to-market capabilities;•reduce customer attrition; and•encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms.In addition to the key elements of our business strategy described above, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. This evaluation resulted in a significant increase in our acquisition activity during fiscal 2017. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services such as the introduction of our Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, and IoT Cloud, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce Quip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform (formerly App Cloud) core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.32Table of ContentsWe also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, Inc. (“Demandware”), a digital commerce leader. We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remained focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2017 and expect to remain similarly focused in fiscal 2018. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate calculation does not include the Marketing and Commerce Cloud service offerings. Our attrition rate was between eight and nine percent during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017, which is comparable to the eight and nine percent attrition rate during the same period a year ago. While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain in this range as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 47 percent of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 and 49 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and build greater brand awareness.In July 2016 we acquired Demandware, an industry-leading provider of enterprise cloud commerce solutions in the digital commerce market. We acquired Demandware to expand our position in customer relationship management and to pursue the digital commerce market segment with the new Salesforce Commerce Cloud. The financial results of Demandware are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Demandware was approximately $2.9 billion.In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) which provides for a $500.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) that matures on July 11, 2019. All amounts borrowed under the Term Loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for Demandware. Additionally, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and certain other institutional lenders that increased our existing revolving credit facility dated October 2014 to $1.0 billion. As of January 31, 2017, there was $200.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In August 2016, we acquired the outstanding stock of Quip, Inc. (“Quip”). Quip combines content and communication to create living documents to allow work-teams to write, edit and discuss documents, spreadsheets and checklists in a single experience. The total purchase price for Quip was approximately $412.0 million.In November 2016, we acquired the outstanding stock of Krux Digital, Inc. (“Krux”). Krux is a leading data management platform that unifies, segments and activates audiences to increase engagement with users, prospects and customers. The total purchase price for Krux was approximately $741.8 million.Prior to these and other acquisitions during fiscal 2017, our most significant acquisition was ExactTarget, Inc in fiscal 2014. Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2017, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, including fiscal 2017, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because 33Table of Contentsthe majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 92 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2017. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below.Revenue by Cloud Service OfferingThe information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major core cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015 Variance- Percent FY'17 and FY'16 Variance- Percent FY'16 and FY'15Sales Cloud $3,060.6 $2,699.0 $2,443.0 13% 10%Service Cloud 2,320.7 1,817.8 1,320.2 28% 38%Salesforce Platform and Other 1,441.6 1,034.7 745.3 39% 39%Marketing Cloud 933.3 654.1 505.3 43% 29%Total $7,756.2 $6,205.6 $5,013.8 Subscription and support revenues from the Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud, IoT Cloud, Commerce Cloud and Salesforce Quip were not significant. Analytics Cloud, IoT Cloud and Salesforce Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Community Cloud revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other revenue depending on the primary service offering purchased. Commerce Cloud revenue, 34Table of Contentsresulting from our Demandware acquisition in July 2016, is included in Marketing Cloud. As required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from Demandware at fair value. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that Demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $933.3 million subscription and support revenue for Marketing Cloud for the fiscal year 2017, approximately 11 percent was attributed to our Demandware acquisition. To the extent Demandware contracts are renewed following the acquisition, we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the respective contractual periods.In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2017 and 10 percent for fiscal 2016, based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above. Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, and not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by core service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful.Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure, relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas, with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement.The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2017, which is consistent with fiscal 2016. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. 35Table of ContentsThe sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable, related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): January 31,2017 October 31,2016 July 31,2016 April 30, 2016Fiscal 2017 Accounts receivable, net$3,196,643 $1,281,425 $1,323,114 $1,192,965Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent5,542,802 3,495,133 3,823,561 4,006,914Operating cash flow (1)706,146 154,312 250,678 1,051,062Unbilled deferred revenue (2)9.0 bn 8.6 bn 8.0 bn 7.6 bn January 31,2016 October 31,2015 July 31,2015 April 30, 2015Fiscal 2016 Accounts receivable, net$2,496,165 $1,060,726 $1,067,799 $926,381Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent4,291,553 2,846,510 3,034,991 3,056,820Operating cash flow (1)470,208 162,514 304,278 735,081Unbilled deferred revenue (2)7.1 bn 6.7 bn 6.2 bn 6.0 bn January 31,2015 October 31,2014 July 31,2014 April 30, 2014Fiscal 2015 Accounts receivable, net$1,905,506 $794,590 $834,323 $684,155Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent3,321,449 2,223,977 2,352,904 2,324,615Operating cash flow (1)336,506 123,732 239,078 482,128Unbilled deferred revenue (2)5.7 bn 5.4 bn 5.0 bn 4.8 bn(1) Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, “Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”), which addresses among other items, updates to the presentation and treatment of excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation on the Statements of Cash Flows. We have adopted changes to the statement of cash flows on a retrospective basis and have accordingly updated the operating cash flow amounts presented above.(2) Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. 36Table of ContentsUnbilled Deferred Revenue, an Operational MeasureThe U.S. GAAP deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table above. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customer's minimum commitment. Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies.Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.37Table of ContentsWe plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses.Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.During fiscal 2017, we recognized stock-based expense of $820.4 million. As of January 31, 2017, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $2.6 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $980.5 million during fiscal 2018; $762.9 million during fiscal 2019; $540.5 million during fiscal 2020; $249.7 million during fiscal 2021; $17.4 million during fiscal 2022; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023; $8.0 million during fiscal 2024. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2017 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more companies.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:•there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•the service has been or is being provided to the customer;•the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.38Table of ContentsSubscription and Support RevenuesSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services and Other RevenuesOur professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed-fee or subscription basis. As discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price.We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent.Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.39Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2017, we deferred $462.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $371.5 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2016, we deferred $380.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $319.1 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $539.6 million at January 31, 2017 and $449.1 million at January 31, 2016.Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs. We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (“ASC 350”), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard.Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.Stock-Based Expense. We recognize stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years. We, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, and as a result, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. We recognize stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings;•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and•discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.In the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations.Goodwill and Intangibles. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected 40Table of Contentsattrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Strategic Investments. We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (“ASC 323”), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities are measured using quoted prices in their respective active markets and non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at cost. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments.We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee’s financial metrics, the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investee’s liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment. 41Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 As a % of Total Revenues 2016 As a % of Total Revenues 2015 As a % of Total RevenuesRevenues: Subscription and support $7,756,205 92% $6,205,599 93% $5,013,764 93%Professional services and other 635,779 8 461,617 7 359,822 7Total revenues 8,391,984 100 6,667,216 100 5,373,586 100Cost of revenues (1)(2): Subscription and support 1,556,353 19 1,188,967 18 924,638 17Professional services and other 677,686 8 465,581 7 364,632 7Total cost of revenues 2,234,039 27 1,654,548 25 1,289,270 24Gross profit 6,157,945 73 5,012,668 75 4,084,316 76Operating expenses (1)(2): Research and development 1,208,127 14 946,300 14 792,917 15Marketing and sales 3,918,027 47 3,239,824 49 2,757,096 51General and administrative 967,563 11 748,238 11 679,936 13Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont 0 0 (36,617) (1) 0 0Total operating expenses 6,093,717 72 4,897,745 73 4,229,949 79Income (loss) from operations 64,228 1 114,923 2 (145,633) (3)Investment income 27,374 0 15,341 0 10,038 0Interest expense (88,988) (1) (72,485) (1) (73,237) (1)Other income (expense) (1) 9,072 0 (15,292) 0 (19,878) 0Gain on sales of land and building improvements 0 0 21,792 0 15,625 0Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments 13,697 0 0 0 0 0Income (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes 25,383 0 64,279 1 (213,085) (4)Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (3) 154,249 2 (111,705) (2) (49,603) (1)Net income (loss) $179,632 2% $(47,426) (1)% $(262,688) (5)%(1) Cost of revenues and marketing and sales expenses include the following amounts related to amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 As a % of Total Revenues 2016 As a % of Total Revenues 2015 As a % of Total RevenuesCost of revenues $127,676 2% $80,918 1% $90,300 2%Marketing and sales 97,601 1 77,152 1 64,673 1Other non-operating expense 2,491 0 3,636 0 0 042Table of Contents(2) Cost of revenues and operating expenses include the following amounts related to stock-based expenses (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 As a % of Total Revenues 2016 As a % of Total Revenues 2015 As a % of Total RevenuesCost of revenues $107,457 1% $69,443 1% $53,812 1%Research and development 187,487 2 129,434 2 121,193 2Marketing and sales 388,937 5 289,152 4 286,410 5General and administrative 136,486 2 105,599 2 103,350 2(3) Amounts include a $210.3 million tax benefit recorded during fiscal 2017 as a result of the partial release of the valuation allowance related to the Demandware, Inc. acquisition.

The increase in subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2017 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Revenue resulting from our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware contributed $120.4 million to total revenues for fiscal 2017. Revenues from other acquired businesses in fiscal 2017 were not material. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Our attrition rate also played a role in the increase in subscription and support revenues. Changes in our pricing have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $635.8 million, or eight percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $461.6 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $174.2 million, or 38 percent. The increase is primarily due to the growth in our subscription professional services.43Table of ContentsRevenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015Americas $6,224,971 $4,910,745 $3,868,329Europe 1,373,547 1,162,808 984,919Asia Pacific 793,466 593,663 520,338 $8,391,984 $6,667,216 $5,373,586 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2017 2016 2015Revenues by geography: Americas 74% 74% 72%Europe 16 17 18Asia Pacific 10 9 10 100% 100% 100%Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $2.2 billion, or 26 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $1.8 billion, or 26 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $410.5 million, or 23 percent. The increase in revenues on a total dollar basis outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally, additional resources and consistent attrition rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis in fiscal 2017 despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $103.8 million compared to fiscal 2016. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent, 95 percent and 94 percent for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $240.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $38.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $162.4 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $23.5 million in professional and outside services, an increase of amortization of purchased intangibles of $46.8 million, an increase in depreciation of equipment of $16.2 million and an increase in allocated overhead of $35.9 million. We have increased our headcount by 34 percent since January 31, 2016 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets may increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 by $41.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the growth in our headcount as well as the increase in employee costs for our subscription professional services employees. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services in future fiscal years. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. 44Table of ContentsOperating Expenses.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $173.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $58.1 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $28.1 million in development and test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 35 percent since January 31, 2016 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.Marketing and sales expenses were $3.9 billion, or 47 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $3.2 billion, or 49 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $678.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $484.3 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $34.7 million in advertising expense, $20.4 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $99.8 million stock-based expense and $36.5 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 24 percent since January 31, 2016. The increase in headcount was also attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and administrative expenses were $967.6 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2017, compared to $748.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $219.3 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $175.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.9 million in stock-based expense and an increase in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 22 percent since January 31, 2016 as we added personnel to support our growth.In connection with the purchase of 50 Fremont, we recognized a net non-cash gain in fiscal 2016 totaling approximately $36.6 million on the termination of the lease signed in January 2012.Other income and expense.

Investment income was $27.4 million for fiscal 2017 and was $15.3 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was due to both realized gains resulting from the sales of marketable securities as well as higher interest income across our portfolio.Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Interest expense was $89.0 million for fiscal 2017 and was $72.5 million 45Table of Contentsduring the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the term loan in fiscal 2017 associated with the Demandware purchase and our outstanding balance in our revolving facility in in fiscal 2017. Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as strategic investments fair market value adjustments, gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions. Gain on sales of land and building improvements consists of the gain the company recognized from sales of undeveloped real estate and a portion of associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California. Gain on sales of land and building improvements, net of closing costs, was $21.8 million during fiscal 2016.Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments represents gains on sales of strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. The difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations.Benefit from (provision for) income taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars(in thousands) 2017 2016 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $154,249 $(111,705) $265,954Effective tax rate (608)% 174% We reported a tax benefit of $154.2 million on a pretax income of $25.4 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 608 percent for fiscal 2017. The most significant component of this tax amount was the tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of our tax valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. Additionally, as a result of early adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, “Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”) and our valuation allowance position, we did not record significant U.S. current income tax expense.We recorded a tax provision of $111.7 million with a pretax income of $64.3 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for fiscal 2016. We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current taxexpense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excesstax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock.We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate and weigh all available positive and negative evidence such as historic results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, as well as prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. Generally, more weight is given to objectively verifiable evidence, such as the cumulative loss in recent years. We will adjust our valuation allowance in the event sufficient positive evidence overcomes the negative evidence of losses in recent years, for example, if the trend in increasing taxable income continues. Our valuation allowance could contribute to the volatility of our effective tax rate and is difficult to forecast in future periods. 46Table of ContentsFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and 2015Revenues.

We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion and accounts receivable of $3.2 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.7 billion during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion during fiscal 2016 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; amortization of debt discount; discrete items such as the non-cash gain from the termination of the 50 Fremont lease; the expense associated with stock-based awards; gains on sales of strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2017 for the transaction fees related to the acquisitions we completed during the year. Our working capital accounts consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, deferred commissions, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters, may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters.As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. 49Table of ContentsNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.5 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016, purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1.1 billion, new office build-outs and strategic and capital investments, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.0 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016 and $698.4 million during fiscal 2015. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2016 primarily related to capital expenditures, strategic investments, business combinations, purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from sales of Mission Bay land and the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building.Net cash provided by financing activities was $997.7 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $73.2 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $748.8 million proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $495.6 million of proceeds from the Term Loan, net of loan fees, $401.5 million from proceeds from equity plans and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from operating activities due to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 offset by $98.2 million of principal payments on capital leases and $550.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities was $73.2 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $318.2 million during fiscal 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $455.5 million from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2015, we repaid the convertible senior notes that matured. In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the “0.25% Senior Notes”), due April 1, 2018, unless earlier purchased by us or converted. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2017. Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders’ option.In July 2016, in order to partially finance the acquisition of Demandware, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict us and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions and repurchase stock. We are also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The Term Loan Credit Agreement includes customary events of default. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate will apply on all obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement at a per annum rate equal to 2.00% above the applicable interest rate for any overdue principal and 2.00% above the rate applicable for base rate loans for any other overdue amounts. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Term Loan Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2017.In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in July 2021. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2017, we had $200.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Subsequent to January 31, 2017, we paid the remaining outstanding balance of the Credit Facility. The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2017.50Table of ContentsIn February 2015, we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately 820,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (“50 Fremont”). At the time of the acquisition, we were leasing approximately 500,000 square feet of the available space in 50 Fremont. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $637.6 million. In financing the purchase price, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash on hand and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the property with the remainder paid in cash.In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years. The agreement provides that we will pay $96.0 million in fiscal 2018, $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2017, we paid $70.0 million. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.As of January 31, 2017, we have a total of $83.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities, and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2017, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): Contractual ObligationsPayments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 YearsCapital lease obligations, including interest$436,747 $119,342 $317,369 $36 $0Operating lease obligations: Facilities space2,536,933 257,387 569,210 507,519 1,202,817 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures382,215 205,863 176,352 0 00.25% Convertible Senior Notes, including interest1,154,313 2,875 1,151,438 0 0Loan assumed on 50 Fremont200,000 0 0 0 200,000Term loan500,000 0 500,000 0 0Revolving Credit Facility200,000 0 0 200,000 0Financing obligation - leased facility322,340 21,437 44,206 45,984 210,713Contractual commitments365,200 122,660 239,558 2,982 0 $6,097,748 $729,564 $2,998,133 $756,521 $1,613,530The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The financing obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2017, $220.3 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities” and the non-current portion is included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.51Table of ContentsIn April 2014, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 732,000 rentable square feet of an office building located in San Francisco, California that is under construction. The lease payments associated with the lease will be approximately $590.0 million over the 15.5 year term of the lease, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018, which is reflected above under Operating Leases.In February 2016, we entered into an agreement to sublease additional office space in New York, New York. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $288.0 million over the approximately 12 year term of the agreement, beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2018. In May 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease additional office space in Indianapolis, Indiana. The amounts associated with the agreement will be approximately $77.0 million over the approximately 13 year term of the agreement, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2018.During fiscal 2017 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock.We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia, South America and Australia. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, revenues in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our Statement of Operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies, deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies.Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer trade accounts, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative.52Table of ContentsWe pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (“ASC 815”), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors.Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expense and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. As the U.S. Dollar strengthened against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in U.S. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were lower relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate. Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion at January 31, 2017. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2017 could result in a $13.0 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $20.9 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions.In March 2013, we issued the 0.25% Senior Notes due April 1, 2018. Holders of the 0.25% Senior Notes may convert the 0.25% Senior Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the 0.25% Senior Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the 0.25% Senior Notes.The 0.25% Senior Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, and therefore we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the 0.25% Senior Notes. However, the value of the 0.25% Senior Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate 0.25% Senior Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.15 billion as of January 31, 2017. The total estimated fair value of our 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2017 53Table of Contentswas $1.5 billion. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which was $126.52. In July 2016, we amended our credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”) to provide for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in July 2021.The borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25%, with such rate being based on the our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2017, there was a $200.0 million outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Agreement. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was 1.9% for fiscal 2017. Subsequent to January 31, 2017, we paid the remaining balance of the Credit Facility. In February 2015, we assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (the “Loan”). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. The Loan requires interest only payments with the remaining principal due at maturity. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of January 31, 2017.In July 2016, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate. The Term Loan is payable in July 2019, with the outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity.By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 1.8% as of January 31, 2017. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.Our strategic investments portfolio consists of investments in over 180 privately held companies, primarily comprised of ISVs and system integrators. We invest in early-to-late stage technology and professional cloud service companies across the globe to support our key business initiatives, which include, among other things, extending the capabilities of our platform and CRM offerings, increasing the ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies and partners, accelerating the adoption of cloud technologies and creating the next-generation of mobile applications and connected products. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $70.0 million, with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of $10 million. As of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016 the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $526.0 million and $504.5 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $758.3 million and $714.1 million as of January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016, respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other than temporary, which could be material. We have in the past written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 54Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:59.567558

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.OverviewWe are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers to connect with their customers in entirely new ways through cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and artificial intelligence technologies. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, our AppExchange, which is our enterprise cloud marketplace, and our professional cloud services - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include:•cross sell and upsell; •extend existing service offerings;•reduce customer attrition; •expand and strengthen the partner ecosystem;•expand internationally;•target vertical industries;•expand into new horizontal markets;•extend go-to-market capabilities;•ensure strong customer adoption; and•encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform.We are also committed to a sustainable, low-carbon future, advancing equality and diversity, and fostering employee success. We try to integrate social good into everything we do. All of these goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities.We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations, acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms, realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, whether internally or through the use of third parties, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, specifically in our top markets, the continued development of our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the continued development of services including Community Cloud, Industry Clouds and Success Cloud, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce 33Table of ContentsQuip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform core service offerings, and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, IoT and collaborative productivity tools. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our July 2016 acquisition of Demandware, Inc. (“Demandware”), a digital commerce leader. We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remain focused on improving operating margins in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our current attrition rate, which does not include the Marketing and Commerce Cloud service offerings, was between eight and nine percent as of January 31, 2018. Our attrition rate, including the Marketing Cloud service offering, was less than ten percent as of January 31, 2018. While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent and 47 percent for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and continue to build greater brand awareness.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2018, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who in our case is the chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed a number of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of our acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because the majority of our offerings operate on a single platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision maker evaluates our financial information and resources and assesses the performance of these resources on a consolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2018. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2018 and 2017.Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are 34Table of Contentsrecorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies.” Revenue by Cloud Service OfferingThe information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 2017 2016 Variance - PercentFiscal 2017 and 2018 Variance - PercentFiscal 2016 and 2017Sales Cloud$3,554.3 $3,060.6 $2,699.0 16% 13%Service Cloud2,877.1 2,320.7 1,817.8 24% 28%Salesforce Platform and Other1,929.2 1,441.6 1,034.7 34% 39%Marketing and Commerce Cloud1,349.9 933.3 654.1 45% 43%Total$9,710.5 $7,756.2 $6,205.6 Subscription and support revenues from the Community Cloud, Quip and our Industry Offerings were not significant in fiscal 2018. Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Our Industry Offerings and Community Cloud revenue are included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased.As required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP""), we recorded deferred revenue related to acquired contracts from Demandware at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that Demandware would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $1,349.9 million subscription and support revenue for Marketing and Commerce Cloud for fiscal 2018, approximately $253.4 million was attributed to Commerce Cloud.In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan and the service that was provided at the inception of the contract. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 14 percent, 13 percent and 10 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above.Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or our Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful.Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing and Commerce Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement.The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter.35Table of ContentsSeasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. Approximately 80 percent of the value of all subscription and support related invoices, excluding Demandware related invoices, were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.Unbilled Deferred Revenue, an Operational MeasureThe deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue is an operational measure that represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue amounts by quarter are reflected in the table below. Our typical contract length is between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing, duration and size of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. Unbilled deferred revenue also does not include any estimates for overage billings above a customer's minimum commitment.The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in thousands, except unbilled deferred revenue): January 31, 2018 October 31,2017 July 31,2017 April 30,2017Fiscal 2018 Accounts receivable, net$3,917,401 $1,519,916 $1,569,322 $1,439,875Deferred revenue7,094,705 4,392,082 4,818,634 5,042,652Operating cash flow (1)1,051,320 125,792 331,269 1,229,584Unbilled deferred revenue13.3 bn 11.5 bn 10.4 bn 9.6 bn January 31, 2017 October 31,2016 July 31,2016 April 30,2016Fiscal 2017 Accounts receivable, net$3,196,643 $1,281,425 $1,323,114 $1,192,965Deferred revenue5,542,802 3,495,133 3,823,561 4,006,914Operating cash flow (1)706,146 154,312 250,678 1,051,062Unbilled deferred revenue9.0 bn 8.6 bn 8.0 bn 7.6 bn36Table of Contents January 31, 2016 October 31,2015 July 31,2015 April 30,2015Fiscal 2016 Accounts receivable, net$2,496,165 $1,060,726 $1,067,799 $926,381Deferred revenue4,291,553 2,846,510 3,034,991 3,056,820Operating cash flow (1)470,208 162,514 304,278 735,081Unbilled deferred revenue 7.1 bn 6.7 bn 6.2 bn 6.0 bn(1)Operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended in the periods stated above.Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of RevenuesCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as IT infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third-party infrastructure providers. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the majority of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. Finally, we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses, technologies and all of our service offerings.Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute 37Table of Contentsdollars and continue to be our largest cost. We expect marketing and sales expenses, excluding sales personnel expenses, to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses. Stock-Based Expenses Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.During fiscal 2018, we recognized stock-based expense related to our equity plans for employees and non-employee directors of $997.0 million. As of January 31, 2018, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was approximately $1.8 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $855.4 million during fiscal 2019; $582.7 million during fiscal 2020; $318.1 million during fiscal 2021; $59.5 million during fiscal 2022; $17.2 million during fiscal 2023 and $8.0 million thereafter. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2018 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods.In prior years, we had our annual equity grant cycle for employees in the month of November. During fiscal 2018, we changed our annual equity grant to occur in the month of March, starting in fiscal 2019. Therefore, the stock-based expense timing for fiscal 2018 is not consistent with prior years. We granted 14.9 million shares under the annual equity grant in fiscal 2017 whereas we did not grant any shares under the annual equity grant cycle in fiscal 2018.Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations and the Purchase of 50 Fremont Our cost of revenues, operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, acquired leases and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied:•there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•the service has been or is being provided to the customer;38Table of Contents•the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and•the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.Subscription and Support RevenuesSubscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.Professional Services and Other RevenuesOur professional services contracts are either on a time and materials, fixed-fee or subscription basis. As discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services. The milestone method for revenue recognition is used when there is substantive uncertainty at the date the contract is entered into whether the milestone will be achieved. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed.Multiple Deliverable ArrangementsWe enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value at contract inception, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value.Multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any.For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price.We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP.Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual installments. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, dollar size and new business linearity within the quarter.Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized.39Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2018, we deferred $799.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $464.7 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2017, we deferred $462.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $371.5 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $874.3 million at January 31, 2018 and $539.6 million at January 31, 2017.Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs. We are required to follow the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification 350 (“ASC 350”), Intangibles- Goodwill and Other in accounting for the cost of computer software developed for internal-use and the accounting for web-based product development costs. ASC 350 requires companies to capitalize qualifying computer software costs, which are incurred during the application development stage, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. We deliver our enterprise cloud computing solutions as a service via all the major Internet browsers and on leading major mobile device operating systems. As a result of this software as a service delivery model, we believe we have larger capitalized costs as compared to traditional enterprise software companies as they are required to use a different accounting standard.Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.Stock-Based Expense. We recognize stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months.Stock-based expenses related to performance share grants are measured based on grant date fair value and expensed on a straight-line basis over the service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of three years. We, at times, grant unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies in lieu of cash consideration. These awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, and as a result, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition stock-based expense. We recognize stock-based expenses equal to the grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings;•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and•discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.In the event that we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment, the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss and disclosed separately within the statements of operations.Goodwill and Intangibles. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected attrition rates, discount rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense.40Table of ContentsIncome Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in our ability to realize deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act"") was enacted into law, significantly changing income tax law that affects U.S corporations. Key changes included a corporate tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018, expensing of certain qualified property, significant changes to the U.S international tax system such as a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. We are required to recognize the effects of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, including the determination of the transition tax and the re-measurement of deferred taxes as well as to re-assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allows companies to record provisional amounts related to the effects of the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the Tax Act and additional guidance and interpretations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, IRS and other standard-setting bodies in the future, we have not completed our analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act. Our provisional estimates will be adjusted during the measurement period defined under SAB 118, based upon our ongoing analysis of our data and tax positions along with the new guidance from regulators and interpretations of the law.Strategic Investments. We hold strategic investments in marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 323 (“ASC 323”), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt securities, which consist of debt investments in privately held companies, are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting. If, based on the terms of our ownership of these marketable and non-marketable securities, we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these marketable and non-marketable securities relate, we apply the equity method of accounting for such investments.We determine the fair value of our marketable equity securities and non-marketable debt and equity securities quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the non-marketable debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events and circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Our assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis includes the investee’s financial metrics, the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, investee’s liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash, and investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. Valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.If the fair value of an investment is below our cost, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our qualitative and quantitative analysis, which includes the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the income statement and establishing a new cost basis for the investment.41Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 As a % of Total revenues 2017 As a % of Total revenues 2016 As a % of Total revenuesRevenues: Subscription and support$9,710,538 93 % $7,756,205 92 % $6,205,599 93 %Professional services and other769,474 7 635,779 8 461,617 7Total revenues10,480,012 100 8,391,984 100 6,667,216 100Cost of revenues (1)(2): Subscription and support 2,033,457 19 1,617,315 19 1,241,692 19Professional services and other 740,065 7 616,724 8 412,856 6Total cost of revenues2,773,522 26 2,234,039 27 1,654,548 25Gross profit7,706,490 74 6,157,945 73 5,012,668 75Operating expenses (1)(2): Research and development1,553,073 15 1,208,127 14 946,300 14Marketing and sales4,829,291 46 3,918,027 47 3,239,824 49General and administrative1,088,358 10 967,563 11 748,238 11Operating lease termination resulting from purchase of 50 Fremont0 0 0 0 (36,617) (1)Total operating expenses7,470,722 71 6,093,717 72 4,897,745 73Income from operations235,768 3 64,228 1 114,923 2Investment income35,848 0 27,374 0 15,341 0Interest expense(86,943) (1) (88,988) (1) (72,485) (1)Other income (expense) (1)17,435 0 9,072 0 (15,292) 0Gain on sales of land and building improvements0 0 0 0 21,792 0Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments0 0 13,697 0 0 0Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes202,108 2 25,383 0 64,279 1Benefit from (provision for) income taxes(74,630) (1) 154,249 2 (111,705) (2)Net income (loss)$127,478 1 % $179,632 2 % $(47,426) (1)%(1) Amounts related to amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 As a % of Total revenues 2017 As a % of Total revenues 2016 As a % of Total revenuesCost of revenues$165,545 2% $127,676 2% $80,918 1%Marketing and sales121,340 1 97,601 1 77,152 1Other income (expense)1,433 0 2,491 0 3,636 042Table of Contents(2) Amounts related to stock-based expenses, as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 As a % of Total revenues 2017 As a % of Total revenues 2016 As a % of Total revenuesCost of revenues$129,954 1% $107,457 1% $69,443 1%Research and development259,838 2 187,487 2 129,434 2Marketing and sales468,553 4 388,937 5 289,152 4General and administrative138,668 1 136,486 2 105,599 2 As of January 31, 2018 2017Selected Balance Sheet Data (in thousands): Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$4,521,705 $2,208,887Deferred revenue7,094,705 5,542,802Unbilled deferred revenue (an operational measure) 13,300,000 9,000,000Principal due on our outstanding debt obligations1,726,821 2,050,000Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue.Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017Revenues.

The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. Our acquisition of Demandware in July 2016 contributed $287.7 million to total revenues in fiscal 2018 as compared to $120.4 million from the date of acquisition to January 31, 2017. This was offset by a reduction in subscription revenues of approximately $20.0 million as a result of one less day in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $769.5 million, or seven percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018, compared to $635.8 million, or eight percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.7 million, or 21 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.Revenues by geography were as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 As a % of Total Revenues 2017 As a % of Total RevenuesAmericas$7,579,116 72% $6,224,971 74%Europe1,903,524 18 1,373,547 16Asia Pacific997,372 10 793,466 10 $10,480,012 100% $8,391,984 100%43Table of ContentsRevenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $191.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $22.5 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $196.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $37.9 million and an increase of $23.2 million in allocated overhead. We have increased our headcount by 11 percent since January 31, 2017 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.The cost of professional services and other revenues was $740.1 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margin of $29.4 million. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $616.7 million during fiscal 2017 resulting in positive gross margins of $19.1 million. We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.Operating Expenses.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of approximately $211.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $72.4 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 11 percent since January 31, 2017 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate previously acquired companies, including our fiscal 2017 acquisitions. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. 44Table of ContentsMarketing and sales expenses were $4.8 billion, or 46 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018, compared to $3.9 billion, or 47 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $911.3 million. The change was primarily due to an increase of $719.8 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $79.6 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $23.7 million, and allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent since January 31, 2017. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and administrative expenses were $1.1 billion, or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2018, compared to $1.0 billion, or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $120.8 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs.

The increase was due to higher interest income across our portfolio.Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 Mission, the loan assumed on 50 Fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of Demandware. Interest expense was $86.9 million for fiscal 2018 and was $89.0 million during the same period a year ago.Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as strategic investment realized gains and losses and other-than-temporary impairments, gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions. The Company sold a portion of its publicly-held investments in fiscal 2018, which resulted in a reclassification of previously unrealized gains from the accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet to other income (expense) in the amount of $58.6 million. This amount was offset by other-than-temporary impairments on strategic investments. Gains from acquisitions of strategic investments represents gains recognized related to strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment.

The tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $154.2 million on a pretax income of $25.4 million for fiscal 2017. The most significant component of this tax amount was the discrete tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of our valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States.45Table of ContentsFiscal Years Ended January 31, 2017 and 2016 Revenues.

The most significant component of this tax amount was the tax benefit of $210.3 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our preexisting deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of our tax valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States. Additionally, as a result of early adopting Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, “Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”) and our valuation allowance position, we did not record significant U.S. current income tax expense.We recorded a tax provision of $111.7 million with a pretax income of $64.3 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 174 percent for fiscal 2016. We had a tax provision in profitable jurisdictions outside the United States and current taxexpense in the United States. We had U.S. current tax expense as a result of taxable income before considering certain excesstax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion and accounts receivable of $3.9 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2018 and $2.2 billion during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.7 billion during fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; amortization of debt discount; the expense associated with stock-based awards; gains on sales of strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable, deferred commissions, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, deferred revenue, and other current 48Table of Contentsliabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across quarters. As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and, correspondingly, the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheets, and as the contract renewal approaches, the corresponding deferred revenue decreases to zero. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.Net cash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion during fiscal 2018 and $2.7 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion and new office build outs and capital investments of $534.0 million, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from the sales of marketable securities of $558.6 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion during fiscal 2017 and $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016, purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1.1 billion, new office build-outs and strategic and capital investments, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.0 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion during fiscal 2016, which primarily related to capital expenditures, strategic investments, business combinations, the purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, new office build-outs, investment of cash balances offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of Mission Bay land and the use of restricted cash to purchase 50 Fremont land and building.Net cash provided by financing activities was $221.2 million during fiscal 2018 as compared to $997.7 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of $650.3 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $200.0 million repayment of the revolving credit facility, $123.2 million of principal payments on conversions of the 0.25% Senior Notes and $105.9 million of principal payments on capital lease obligations. Net cash provided by financing activities was $997.7 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $73.2 million during fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of $748.8 million proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $495.6 million of proceeds from the Term Loan, net of loan fees, $401.5 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $98.2 million of principal payments on capital leases and $550.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $455.5 million from proceeds from equity plan offset by $82.3 million of principal payments on capital leases and $300.0 million payment of our revolving credit facility.In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (“0.25% Senior Notes”), due April 2018, unless earlier purchased by us or converted. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2018 as they are due within one year. As of January 31, 2018 the remaining principal balance of the 0.25% Senior Notes outstanding is $1.03 billion.In July 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (“Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) that matures in July 2021. We may use any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement. As of January 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We were in compliance with the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2018.In July 2016, to partially finance the acquisition of Demandware, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (“Term Loan”) which matures in July 2019. As of January 31, 2018, the noncurrent outstanding principal portion of the Term Loan was $500.0 million.All outstanding amounts under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be due and payable in July 2019. The Company may prepay the Term Loan, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and 49Table of Contentsamounts repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The Company’s obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting certain thresholds set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with the Term Loan Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2018.As of January 31, 2018, we have a total of $99.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2018, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands):Contractual ObligationsPayments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 YearsCapital lease obligations, including interest$317,645 $115,909 $201,695 $41 $0Operating lease obligations: Facilities space2,727,369 335,289 660,807 575,673 1,155,600 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures555,958 275,636 280,322 0 00.25% Convertible Senior Notes1,026,821 1,026,821 0 0 0Loan assumed on 50 Fremont200,000 2,128 7,661 8,257 181,954Term loan500,000 0 500,000 0 0Financing obligation - leased facility300,903 21,881 45,095 46,872 187,055Contractual commitments513,831 185,449 229,132 53,500 45,750 $6,142,527 $1,963,113 $1,924,712 $684,343 $1,570,359The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.The financing obligation - leased facility above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 Mission St. (""350 Mission"") in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2018, $218.2 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities” and the noncurrent portion is included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a third-party provider for certain infrastructure services for a period of four years. We paid $96.0 million in connection with this agreement during fiscal 2018. The agreement further provides that we will pay an additional $108.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $126.0 million in fiscal 2020. This agreement is included in the table above under contractual commitments.In July 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third-party to obtain the exclusive naming rights for the Salesforce Transit Center project in San Francisco for a period of 25 years. We paid a non-refundable fee of $1.0 million upon execution of the agreement and we are obligated to pay approximately $4.4 million each year over the life of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated by us without cause upon satisfaction of certain conditions and is therefore excluded from the table above.During fiscal 2018 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.50Table of ContentsIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock.We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. We expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months, primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the U.S, to be consistent with those paid in prior years. Additionally, the one-time transition tax under the Tax Act will not have an impact on our cash taxes based on our provisional assessment.New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending. Other InformationEnvironmental, Social and GovernanceWe believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, community, environment and society. We are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by delivering a carbon neutral cloud, operating as a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company and by working to achieve our goal of 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations. In addition, we have spearheaded initiatives to drive equality in four key areas: equal rights, equal pay, equal education and equal opportunity. We also pioneered and have inspired other companies to adopt our 1-1-1 integrated philanthropy model, which leverages 1 percent of a company’s equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. Together with the Salesforce Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and Salesforce.org, a nonprofit social enterprise, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, we have given approximately $200 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 2.6 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 34,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount.Below are some of the key highlights of our environmental, social and governance efforts:•In fiscal 2018 we achieved net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and began delivering a carbon neutral cloud for all customers. In addition, we are committed to working toward 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations. To support this goal, in fiscal 2016, we signed two virtual power purchase agreements in West Virginia and Texas and, in fiscal 2018, we began sourcing 100 percent renewable energy for approximately 90 percent of our urban campus in San Francisco.•As part of our ongoing work to promote equality in employee pay, opportunity and advancement, in fiscal 2017, we initiated our equal pay assessment and subsequently adjusted our pay practices to eliminate statistically significant gender-associated differences in pay, committing approximately $6 million to this end to date.•In fiscal 2018, we announced that Salesforce Tower will feature the largest on-site water recycling system in a commercial high-rise building in the United States. The system is expected to reduce the building's water consumption and provide water recycling capabilities for all building tenants.•We strive to integrate sustainability into our corporate events. For example, at Dreamforce 2017, we offset 100 percent of onsite event greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions from employee travel, through carbon credits purchased by us.•We are active in and support organizations that move the United States and the world toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future. For example, we were a founding member of the Business Renewables Center, signed the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Principles, helped to launch the Corporate Colocation and Cloud Buyers’ Principles, disclose our annual carbon emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project, and signed on to initiatives such as We Mean Business and the American Business Act on Climate. •We have significantly increased the diversity of our Board over the past five years, including with respect to gender and race. We leverage a number of communications channels and strategic content to better serve and engage our many stakeholders. Our sustainability website, www.salesforce.com/company/sustainability, provides information regarding our environmental and other sustainability efforts, including our annual impact reports and our environmental policy.

The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, costs incurred in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and deferred revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies.Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer account receivables, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (“ASC 815”), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. As the USD fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and deferred revenue that we reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were higher relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion at January 31, 2018. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2018 could result in a $33.5 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market 53Table of Contentsvalue changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $2.2 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.0 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (“Notes”) due in April 2018. Holders of the Notes may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. The amounts in excess of the principal amounts, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes.The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The principal balance of our Notes was $1.03 billion as of January 31, 2018. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2018 was $1.8 billion. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which was $170.95.In July 2016, we amended our credit agreement (“Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”) to provide for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) that matures in July 2021. The Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.125% to 0.25%, with such rate being based on our consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2018 there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility. In February 2015, we assumed a $200.0 million loan with the acquisition of 50 Fremont (“Loan”). The Loan bears an interest rate of 3.75% per annum and is due in June 2023. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, the Loan requires interest only payments. Beginning in fiscal 2019, principal and interest payments are required, with the remaining principal due at maturity. The Loan can be prepaid at any time subject to a yield maintenance fee. The agreement governing the Loan contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that we were in compliance with as of January 31, 2018.In July 2016, we entered into a $500.0 million term loan (“Term Loan”) which matures in July 2019 and bears interest at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.75% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.00% to 1.75%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. We entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of Demandware. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at a rate based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate.By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.2% as of January 31, 2018. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations.The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. As of January 31, 2018, our portfolio consists of investments in over 200 privately held companies and two public companies, primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. Our investments in these companies range from $0.2 million to over $90.0 million, with 16 investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10.0 million as of January 31, 2018.54Table of ContentsWe invest in early-to-late stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. We plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractiveThe primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies, accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of mobile applications and connected products. Therefore, we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. Currently, one of our publicly held investments is subject to such a contractual obligation, which expires in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.Our strategic investments in privately held companies are primarily in preferred stock of the respective investees and therefore provide us with liquidation preferences in the event there are certain liquidation events. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable debt at their estimated fair value and equity securities of the privately held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017, the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $652.8 million and $526.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies was $912.0 million and $758.3 million as of January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017, respectively. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in fair value, we may be required to record an impairment that is other-than-temporary, which could be material. We have in the past recorded other than temporary impairments or written off the full value of specific investments. Similar situations could occur in the future and negatively impact our financial results. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital. 55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:33:00.044859

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.OverviewWe are a global leader in customer relationship management (""CRM"") technology that enables companies to improve their relationships and interactions with customers. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to empower our customers of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (""IoT"") and artificial intelligence (""AI"") technologies. Our Customer Success Platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, integration solutions, application development, IoT integration, collaborative productivity tools, our AppExchange, which is our enterprise cloud marketplace, and our professional cloud services - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. Key elements of our strategy include:•cross sell and upsell; •extend existing service offerings;•reduce customer attrition; •expand and strengthen the partner ecosystem;•expand internationally;•target vertical industries;•expand into new horizontal markets;•extend go-to-market capabilities;•ensure strong customer adoption; and•encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform.We are also committed to a sustainable, low-carbon future, advancing equality and diversity, and fostering employee success. We try to integrate social good into everything we do. All of these goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities.We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations, acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms, realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, whether internally or through the use of third parties, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, 35Table of Contentsspecifically in our top markets, the continued development of our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the continued development of services including Community Cloud and Industry Clouds, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as Commerce Cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and Salesforce Quip, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud, Salesforce Platform core service offerings, Integration Cloud through our May 2018 MuleSoft, Inc. (""MuleSoft"") acquisition and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, IoT and collaborative productivity tools. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our acquisition of MuleSoft and in August 2018 our acquisition of Datorama, Inc. (""Datorama""). We have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remain focused on improving operating margins. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our attrition rate, including the Marketing Cloud service offering but excluding our Commerce Cloud service offering and integration service offering, was less than ten percent as of January 31, 2019. While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent, 44 percent and 45 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and continue to build greater brand awareness.During the year, we acquired MuleSoft, an industry-leading integration platform, to provide our customers the ability to integrate data across platforms. The financial results of MuleSoft are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for MuleSoft was approximately $6.4 billion.Also in fiscal 2019, we acquired Datorama, which provides a platform for enterprises, agencies and publishers to integrate data across marketing channels and data sources. The financial results of Datorama are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Datorama was approximately $766 million.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2019, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019.Adoption of New Accounting StandardsWe have adjusted our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""Topic 606"")"", which relates to revenue recognition and the capitalization of costs to acquire a revenue contract. The information presented reflects the adjusted amounts as compared to those previously reported. In addition, we have prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, ""Financial Instrument-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)"" (""ASU 2016-01"") and Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory"" (""ASU 2016-16""). See Note 1, “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision makers, Marc Benioff, who is the co-chief executive officer and the chairman of the board, and Keith Block, who is the co-chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, we have completed a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of MuleSoft and Datorama in fiscal 2019. These acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of our acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because most of our offerings operate on a single customer success platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision makers evaluate our financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a 36Table of Contentsconsolidated basis. Since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.In August 2018, we moved to a co-chief executive officer model with the promotion of our vice chairman and chief operating officer, Keith Block. We determined that both co-chief executive officers also serve as chief operating decision makers for the purposes of segment reporting. Despite the change in the chief operating decision maker, we determined no change to segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated. Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, ""Cloud Services""), software licenses, and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2019. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, and the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services.Subscription and support revenues for Cloud Services are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Subscription revenues for software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue, or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Note 1 ""Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.Revenue by Cloud Service OfferingThe information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 2018 2017 Variance - PercentFiscal 2018 and 2019 Variance - PercentFiscal 2017 and 2018Sales Cloud$4,040 $3,588 $3,076 13% 17%Service Cloud3,621 2,883 2,343 26% 23%Salesforce Platform and Other2,854 1,913 1,433 49% 33%Marketing and Commerce Cloud1,898 1,382 947 37% 46%Total$12,413 $9,766 $7,799 Subscription and support revenues from the Community Cloud, Quip and our Industry Offerings were not significant in fiscal 2019. Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above. Our Industry Offerings and Community Cloud revenue are included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased. Revenue from our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018 is included in Salesforce Platform and Other.37Table of ContentsAs required under U.S. GAAP, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from MuleSoft at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that MuleSoft would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $2.9 billion subscription and support revenue for Salesforce Platform and Other for fiscal 2019, approximately $360 million was attributed to MuleSoft.In situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an Enterprise License Agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer’s estimated product demand plan, the service that was provided at the inception of the contract, and standalone selling price (""SSP"") of those products. We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 17 percent, 15 percent, 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above.Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or the Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful.Our Sales Cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. As a result, Sales Cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings. Conversely, revenue for Marketing and Commerce Cloud is primarily derived from the Americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement.The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. While we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. Accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter.Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in unearned revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions): January 31, 2019 October 31, 2018 July 31, 2018 April 30, 2018Fiscal 2019 Accounts receivable, net$4,924 $2,037 $1,980 $1,763Unearned revenue8,564 5,376 5,883 6,201Operating cash flow1,331 143 458 1,466 January 31, 2018 October 31, 2017 July 31, 2017 April 30, 2017Fiscal 2018 Accounts receivable, net$3,921 $1,522 $1,572 $1,442Unearned revenue6,995 4,312 4,749 4,969Operating cash flow1,052 125 331 1,23038Table of ContentsThe unearned revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations (""Remaining Performance Obligation"") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligations attributable to a particular subscription agreement are often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Remaining performance obligation, formerly referred to as remaining transaction price, consisted of the following (in billions): Current Noncurrent TotalAs of January 31, 2019$11.9 $13.8 $25.7*As of October 31, 2018$10.0 $11.2 $21.2As of July 31, 2018$9.8 $11.2 $21.0As of April 30, 2018$9.6 $10.8 $20.4As of January 31, 2018$9.6 $11.0 $20.6*Includes $500 million of remaining performance obligation related to fiscal 2019 acquisitions, including contracts executed subsequent to acquisition. Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of RevenuesCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. We allocate overhead such as IT infrastructure, rent, and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third-party infrastructure providers. In addition, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in enhancing our cyber security measures. As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with the purchase of acquired developed technology will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. Finally, we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.39Table of ContentsWe expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses, technologies and all of our service offerings.Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers, and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. In addition, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. We expect marketing and sales expenses, excluding sales personnel expenses, to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses. These may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, security costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses such as transaction costs for acquisitions and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. However, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses. Stock-Based Expenses Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Acquired Through Business CombinationsOur cost of revenues, operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s developed technology, trade names and trademarks, and customer relationships. We expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.40Table of ContentsCloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (""SSP"") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts. Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. Significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. Therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•the acquired company’s trade name and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and•discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gain, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Privately held 41Table of Contentsequity securities without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer and impairments.Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee.We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.42Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 As a % of Total Revenues 2018 (as adjusted)* As a % of Total Revenues 2017 (as adjusted)* As a % of Total RevenuesRevenues: Subscription and support$12,413 93 % $9,766 93 % $7,799 92 %Professional services and other869 7 774 7 638 8Total revenues13,282 100 10,540 100 8,437 100Cost of revenues (1)(2): Subscription and support 2,604 20 2,033 19 1,617 19Professional services and other 847 6 740 7 617 7Total cost of revenues3,451 26 2,773 26 2,234 26Gross profit9,831 74 7,767 74 6,203 74Operating expenses (1)(2): Research and development1,886 14 1,553 15 1,208 14Marketing and sales6,064 46 4,671 44 3,811 45General and administrative1,346 10 1,089 10 966 12Total operating expenses9,296 70 7,313 69 5,985 71Income from operations535 4 454 5 218 3Investment income57 0 36 0 27 0Interest expense(154) (1) (87) (1) (89) (1)Gains on strategic investments, net542 4 19 0 31 0Other income (expense)3 0 (2) 0 (8) 0Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes983 7 420 4 179 2Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (3)127 1 (60) (1) 144 2Net income$1,110 8 % $360 3 % $323 4 %(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 As a % of Total Revenues 2018 As a % of Total Revenues 2017 As a % of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$215 2% $166 2% $128 2%Marketing and sales232 2 121 1 98 1(2) Amounts related to stock-based expenses, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 As a % of Total Revenues 2018 As a % of Total Revenues 2017 As a % of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$161 1% $130 1% $107 1%Research and development307 2 260 2 188 2Marketing and sales643 5 469 5 389 5General and administrative172 1 138 1 136 2(3) Amount includes a benefit related to the partial release of the valuation allowance of $612 million, $2 million and $226 million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018 contributed $431 million to total revenues in fiscal 2019. The increase was also driven by approximately $227 million of revenue recognized at a point in time, which includes the portion of software subscriptions allocated to the on-premise software element.We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.Revenues by geography were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended January 31,(in millions)2019 As a % of Total Revenues 2018 As a % of Total Revenues Growth rateAmericas$9,445 71% $7,621 72% 24%Europe2,553 19 1,916 18 33Asia Pacific1,284 10 1,003 10 28 $13,282 100% $10,540 100% 26Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. Americas revenue attributed to the United States was approximately 96 percent during fiscal year 2019 and 2018.Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $3.8 billion, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2019, compared to $2.9 billion, or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 31 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. Revenues outside of the Americas increased on a total dollar basis by $39 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling.44Table of ContentsCost of Revenues.

We have increased our headcount by 16 percent since January 31, 2018 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which a component was also due to the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods.The cost of professional services and other revenues was $847 million during fiscal 2019 resulting in positive gross margin of $22 million. The cost of professional services and other revenues was $740 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margins of $34 million. We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters.

We increased our research and development headcount by 19 percent since January 31, 2018 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies, and integrate acquired companies, including our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. Additionally, a component of our increased headcount was also due to the acquisition of MuleSoft. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. The increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $797 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $174 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $111 million, and allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2018, of which a component was due to the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 27 percent since January 31, 2018 as we added personnel to support our growth as well as an increase due to the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018.45Table of ContentsOther income and expense.

The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense on the 2023 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes of approximately $71 million. We expect interest expense to increase in future years as the 2023 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes will be outstanding for a full year as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2019. Gains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. The prospective adoption of ASU 2016-01 resulted in unrealized gains in our equity securities of approximately $446 million during fiscal 2019, excluding gains on sales of equity securities. These gains were primarily driven by mark-to-market adjustments to our publicly traded securities of $345 million during fiscal 2019.Other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions.

Additionally, fiscal 2018 benefited from a full year of revenue from Demandware, which we acquired in July 2016. This was offset by a reduction in subscription revenues of approximately $20 million as a result of one less day in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.46Table of ContentsRevenues by geography were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018 As a % of Total Revenues 2017 As a % of Total Revenues Growth rateAmericas$7,621 72% $6,259 74% 22%Europe1,916 18 1,383 16% 39Asia Pacific1,003 10 795 10% 26 $10,540 100% $8,437 100% 25Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer.

The tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $144 million on a pretax income of $179 million for fiscal 2017. The most significant component of this tax amount was the discrete tax benefit of $210 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of Demandware. The net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of Demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of our valuation allowance. The tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion and accounts receivable of $4.9 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2019, our remaining performance obligation was $25.7 billion. Our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. 48Table of ContentsIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.Cash FlowsFor fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$3,398 $2,738 $2,162Net cash used in investing activities(5,308) (2,011) (2,684)Net cash provided by financing activities2,010 221 998Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; the expense associated with stock-based awards; net gains on strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of our semi-annual interest payments related to our senior notes; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2019 for the transaction fees related to the acquisition of MuleSoft.Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable, costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, unearned revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services, and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. Our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries. Our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across the quarters.As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and, correspondingly, the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and unearned revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheets, and as the next billing cycle approaches, the corresponding unearned revenue decreases to zero. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. As such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 primarily related to the acquisitions of MuleSoft, Datorama and CloudCraze, net of cash acquired for a total of $5.1 billion. Net cash used in investing activities also included purchases of marketable securities of $1.1 billion, purchases of strategic investments of $362 million and new office build outs and capital investments of $595 million, offset by sales of marketable securities of $1.4 billion. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion, new office build-outs and capital investments of $534 million, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $636 million. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of Demandware in July 2016 and purchases of marketable securities, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities.Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $3.0 billion from proceeds from issuance of debt which were used in the acquisition of MuleSoft, and $704 million from proceeds from equity plans, offset by $1.5 billion of repayments of debt including principal payments on the maturity of the 0.25% Senior Notes and the early repayment and termination of the 2019 Term Loan.

In addition, we have senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on 50 Fremont due in 2023 with a total carrying value of $196 million. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2019.We maintain a revolving loan credit agreement that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured financing (""Credit Facility"") that matures in April 2023. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2019, we have a total of $92 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures, excluding all secured and unsecured debt.

As of January 31, 2019, $215 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” and the noncurrent portion is included in “Other noncurrent liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.The lease obligation - buildings to be constructed above represents the total obligation for two separate agreements for office facilities we entered into during fiscal 2019. The first agreement is for approximately 324,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed as part of our urban campus in San Francisco, California. We expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2024 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $480 million over 16 years. Construction has not commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approvals from the City and County of San Francisco. The second agreement is for approximately 603,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed in Chicago, Illinois. We expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2022 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $475 million over 17 years. As of January 31, 2019 construction has not commenced on either of these buildings and the timing of completion of construction is unknown. Due to this uncertainty, the entire commitment for these two obligations is reflected as payments due in more than five years in the table above. We have entered into various contractual commitments with infrastructure service providers for a total commitment of $2.0 billion, which are reflected in the table above under ""contractual commitments."" As of January 31, 2019, the total remaining commitment is approximately $1.8 billion and $264 million is due in the next fiscal year. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.During fiscal 2019 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.Utilization of tax carryforwards and creditsAs we continue our trend in profitability, we expect to utilize our net operating loss carryforward and various tax credits to reduce our cash tax payments. For example, our Federal net operating loss carryforwards are $2.1 billion as of January 31, 51Table of Contents2019 as compared to $2.7 billion as of January 31, 2018. We expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months, primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the U.S, to be consistent with those paid in prior years. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and those pending. Environmental, Social and GovernanceWe believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, partners, employees, community, environment and society. We are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by delivering a carbon neutral cloud, operating as a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company and by working to achieve our goal of 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations by fiscal 2022. We also believe consistent, comparable and reliable disclosures around climate-related risks and opportunities are important. To this end, we are working to align with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's (""FSB"") Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (""TCFD"") and of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (""SASB""). In addition, we have spearheaded human capital management initiatives to drive equality in four key areas: equal rights, equal pay, equal education and equal opportunity. We also pioneered and have inspired other companies to adopt our 1-1-1 integrated philanthropy model, which leverages one percent of a company’s equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. We publish an annual stakeholder impact report on our website detailing our overall strategy relating to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) programs as well as our efforts in these areas.Below are some of the key highlights of our ongoing ESG efforts:•In fiscal 2019, we remained a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company, continued delivering a carbon neutral cloud for all customers and procured electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 55 percent of what we used globally. To support our commitment to renewable energy, we have signed four virtual power purchase agreements (“VPPAs”). This includes two agreements which were signed in fiscal 2019: our largest VPPA to date with a new wind energy project in Illinois that is expected to be operational in fiscal year 2020, and our first-ever renewable energy aggregation deal with a new solar energy project in North Carolina which is expected to be operational in fiscal 2021. In addition, the three buildings at our corporate headquarters in San Francisco sourced 100 percent renewable energy in fiscal 2019.•We are active in and support organizations that move the United States and the world toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future. In fiscal 2019, we partnered with Mission 2020 to establish the Step Up Declaration, a new alliance committed to harnessing the power of emerging technologies to help reduce emissions across all economic sectors. As part of the declaration we committed to expand our carbon offset program to include business travel and employee commuting, and to continue to expand our sustainable real estate commitments. We also committed to setting our own science-based targets, including working with our suppliers to set their own climate targets. In addition, we were a founding member of the Business Renewables Center, signed the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers’ Principles, helped to launch the Corporate Colocation and Cloud Buyers’ Principles, disclosed our annual carbon emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project and signed on to initiatives such as We Mean Business and the American Business Act on Climate.•As part of our ongoing work to promote equality, we review the salaries and bonuses of our global workforce on an annual basis to ensure everyone is paid equally for equal work and close any unexplained gaps. To date, we have spent $8.7 million to ensure equal pay for equal work. We also review differences in pay for not only gender, but also race and ethnicity in the United States.•Our employees are engaged in and actively support our commitment to equality and enhancing our Ohana culture. We support ten employee-led and founded “Ohana Groups,” which provide a community for underrepresented groups and their allies, offer professional development and mentoring opportunities, and empower employees to be responsive equality leaders in their community. This has resulted in nearly half of our employees engaging in Ohana Groups in fiscal 2019.•Together with the Salesforce Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and Salesforce.org, a nonprofit social enterprise, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, to date we have given approximately $260 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 3.8 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 40,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount.•We have significantly increased the diversity of our Board over the past five years, including with respect to gender and race.52Table of ContentsWe leverage a number of communications channels and strategic content to better serve and engage our many stakeholders.

The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom (""UK"") subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound are first converted into the British Pound and then British Pounds are translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, costs incurred in France are translated from the Euro to the British Pound and then into the USD. Our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2020, we will begin transitioning away from this UK-centralized European structure and enable some of our local subsidiaries within Europe to invoice customers directly and thereby recognize revenues, operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies. With the change to local invoicing in some markets, we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency thereby reducing our foreign currency exposure.The U.K. held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (""EU"") (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the UK government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the UK's relationship with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect UK, regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have evaluated and started to implement initiatives, such as the commitment to invest resources in Dublin, Ireland, that could partially mitigate the impact Brexit could have on our operations. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, total revenues generated in Europe were approximately 19 percent, 18 percent and 16 percent of total revenues, respectively, of which substantially all were recorded in our UK subsidiary. Revenues in Europe increased on a total dollar basis by $35 million and $104 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, respectively, as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling. We recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of Brexit negotiations, and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business.Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (“ASC 815”), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate 53Table of Contentsrealized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Although the USD fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and unearned revenue that we reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the three months using a constant currency rate.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion at January 31, 2019. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2019 could result in a $21 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.5 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $34 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In addition, we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): Instrument Maturity date Principal Outstanding as of January 31, 2019 Interest Terms Effective interest rate for fiscal 20192021 Term Loan May 2021 $500 Floating 3.05%2023 Senior Notes April 2023 1,000 Fixed 3.26%2028 Senior Notes April 2028 1,500 Fixed 3.70%Loan assumed on 50 Fremont June 2023 198 Fixed 3.75%Revolving credit facility April 2023 0 Floating N/AThe 2021 Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at either a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.625% to 1.25%, in each case, with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. By entering into the 2021 Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. The 2021 Term Loan was signed in April 2018 and funds were received in May 2018. The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.375% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.375%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the revolving credit facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.05% to 0.175%, with such rate being based on our public 54Table of Contentsdebt rating, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2019, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility. The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. As of January 31, 2019, our portfolio, which consists of investments in over 235 privately held companies and six public companies, is primarily comprised of independent software vendors and system integrators. Our investments in these companies range from $0.1 million to approximately $105 million, with 21 investments individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10 million as of January 31, 2019.We invest in early-to-late stage enterprise cloud companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives to grow our ecosystem of partners and accelerate the adoption of cloud technologies. We invest in both domestic and international companies and currently hold investments in all of our regions: the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. We plan to continue to invest in these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive.The primary purpose of our investments is to create an ecosystem of enterprise cloud companies, accelerate the growth of technology startups and system integrators and create the next generation of AI, mobile applications and connected products. Therefore, we continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. Currently, three of our six publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation, which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.Upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the statement of operations. As such we anticipate additional volatility to our statements of operations in future periods, due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes and impairments of our investments in privately held securities. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our strategic investments portfolio.In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:59.611612

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.The following section generally discusses Fiscal Year 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between Fiscal Year 2020 and 2019, as well as certain Fiscal Year 2018 items. Discussions of Fiscal Year 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal year 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019.OverviewWe are a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that brings companies and customers together. We introduced our first CRM solution in 2000, and we have since expanded our service offerings with new editions, features and platform capabilities. Our core mission is to enable our customers of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, blockchain, voice and artificial intelligence (“AI”), to transform their businesses. Our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce, analytics and more to give our customers a single source of information about their customers.Website references throughout this document are provided for convenience only, and the content on the referenced websites is not incorporated by reference into this report.Highlights from the Fiscal Year 2020.•Acquisitions: During fiscal 2020 we completed the acquisition of Tableau Software, Inc. (""Tableau"") for $14.8 billion in common stock issued, cash and fair value of equity assumed, ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (""ClickSoftware"") for $1.4 billion in cash, common stock issued and fair value of equity assumed, and Salesforce.org for $300 million in cash.•Revenue: Total fiscal 2020 revenue was $17.1 billion, an increase of 29 percent year-over-year. Total fiscal 2020 revenues included approximately $228 million and $689 million of revenues from Salesforce.org and Tableau, respectively.31Table of Contents•Earnings per Share: Fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share was $0.15, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.43 from a year ago.•Cash: Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the fiscal year at $7.9 billion. Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2020 was $4.3 billion, an increase of 27 percent year-over-year. •Remaining Performance Obligation: Remaining performance obligation ended the fiscal year at approximately $30.8 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligation includes approximately $450 million and $650 million related to the Salesforce.org business combination in June 2019 and the Tableau acquisition in August 2019, respectively. Current remaining performance obligation ended the fiscal year at approximately $15.0 billion, an increase of 26 percent year-over-year. We continue to invest for future growth through focusing on multi-cloud adoption by our existing customers, growing our relationships with our enterprise customers, expanding internationally and expanding and strengthening our ecosystem of partners and independent software vendors (“ISVs”). As a result, we continue to win customers from competitors in the markets in which we compete. In addition, we continue to expand in the growing addressable markets across all of our service offerings providing additional opportunities for growth in our business and results.We regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings through a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As part of our business and growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our recent business combination with Salesforce.org in June 2019 and acquisitions of Tableau in August 2019 and ClickSoftware in October 2019. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income.We periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for long-term growth, which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity. In addition, we have experienced, and may at times in the future experience, more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business, which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions. While we do not expect any of these changes to have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our near-term or long-term revenue targets, slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.In December 2019, a novel strain of Coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak to constitute a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern."" The extent of the impact of the Coronavirus on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. For example, in response to the Coronavirus epidemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. At this point, the extent to which the Coronavirus may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Due to our subscription based business model, the effect of the Coronavirus may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. The expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue results for fiscal 2020 and had a minimal impact on our remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2020. We expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2020, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments. 32Table of ContentsAdoption of New Accounting StandardsWe adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)"" (""ASU 2016-02""), also referred to as Topic 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020, and as a result, the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2020 is not comparable with that of January 31, 2019. In addition, in fiscal 2019 we prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, ""Financial Instrument-Overall (Subtopic 825-10)"" (""ASU 2016-01""). See Note 1, “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and related professional services. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2020. Subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, ""Cloud Services""). With the May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft and the August 2019 acquisition of Tableau, subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses. Software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations”, fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers, and as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or the Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage. In addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. Accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by service offering over time may not be meaningful.Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Conversely, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions):33Table of ContentsRemaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Remaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):34Table of Contents(1) Includes approximately $450 million and $650 million of remaining performance obligation related to the Salesforce.org business combination in June 2019 and the Tableau acquisition in August 2019, respectively.(2) Includes approximately $400 million and $550 million of remaining performance obligation related to the Salesforce.org business combination in June 2019 and the Tableau acquisition in August 2019, respectively. (3) Includes approximately $350 million of remaining performance obligation related to the Salesforce.org business combination in June 2019.Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesImpact of AcquisitionsThe comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019. Expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data and employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and certain third-party fees. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and allocated overhead. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees. 35Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct.We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (""SSP"") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts. Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. Significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. Therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•the acquired company’s trade name and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;•discount rates;•uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; •fair value of assumed equity awards; and•fair value of pre-existing relationships.36Table of ContentsUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data and require the use of judgment. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available. The determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee.We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.37Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2020% of Total Revenues2019% of Total Revenues2018% of Total RevenuesRevenues:Subscription and support$16,043 94 %$12,413 93 %$9,766 93 %Professional services and other1,055 6 869 7 774 7 Total revenues17,098 100 13,282 100 10,540 100 Cost of revenues (1)(2):Subscription and support 3,198 19 2,604 20 2,033 19 Professional services and other 1,037 6 847 6 740 7 Total cost of revenues4,235 25 3,451 26 2,773 26 Gross profit12,863 75 9,831 74 7,767 74 Operating expenses (1)(2):Research and development2,766 16 1,886 14 1,553 15 Marketing and sales7,930 46 6,064 46 4,671 44 General and administrative1,704 10 1,346 10 1,089 10 Loss on settlement of Salesforce.org reseller agreement166 1 0 0 0 0 Total operating expenses12,566 73 9,296 70 7,313 69 Income from operations 297 2 535 4 454 5 Gains on strategic investments, net 427 2 542 4 19 0 Other expense (18) 0 (94) (1) (53) (1) Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes 706 4 983 7 420 4 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (3) (580) (3) 127 1 (60) (1) Net income $126 1 %$1,110 8 %$360 3 %38Table of Contents(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2020% of Total Revenues2019% of Total Revenues2018% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$440 3 %$215 2 %$166 2 %Marketing and sales352 2 %232 2 121 1 (2) Amounts related to stock-based expenses, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2020% of Total Revenues2019% of Total Revenues2018% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$204 1 %$161 1 %$130 1 %Research and development510 3 307 2 260 2 Marketing and sales852 5 643 5 469 5 General and administrative219 1 172 1 138 1 (3) Amounts include a benefit related to the partial release of the valuation allowance of $612 million, and $2 million, for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Impact of AcquisitionsThe comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended January, 31 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 was impacted by our recent business combination and acquisitions, including the acquisition of Tableau in August 2019, which has been our largest acquisition to date. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Variance(in millions)20202019DollarsPercentSubscription and support$16,043 $12,413 $3,630 29 %Professional services and other1,055 869 186 21 Total revenues$17,098 $13,282 $3,816 29 The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. Revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately five percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2020. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent and 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.39Table of ContentsThe business combination with Salesforce.org in June 2019 and acquisition of Tableau in August 2019 contributed approximately $217 million and $652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2020, respectively. In addition, total revenues for fiscal 2020 benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018. As a result of our business combination activity, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve month basis as of the end of each month. As of January 31, 2020, our attrition rate, excluding Commerce Cloud, Integration Cloud, Salesforce.org and Tableau, was less than nine percent. Our attrition rate for fiscal 2020 benefited, in part, from the ongoing shift in our business mix to enterprise and international markets which have longer customer contract term durations. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until fully integrated into our customer success organization. While it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.Subscription and Support Revenue by Service OfferingSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 20202019Variance PercentSales Cloud$4,598 $4,040 14% Service Cloud4,466 3,621 23% Salesforce Platform and Other4,473 2,854 57% Marketing and Commerce Cloud2,506 1,898 32% Total$16,043 $12,413 Subscription and support revenues from Quip Collaboration Platform were not significant in fiscal 2020 and 2019. Our Industry Offerings revenue is included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased. Integration and Analytics revenues are included in Salesforce Platform and Other. The acquisition of Tableau in August 2019 contributed approximately $652 million to Salesforce Platform and Other. Revenues by geography were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended January 31,(in millions)2020As a % of Total Revenues2019As a % of Total RevenuesGrowth RateAmericas$12,051 71 %$9,445 71 %28 %Europe3,430 20 2,553 19 34 Asia Pacific1,617 9 1,284 10 26 Total$17,098 100 %$13,282 100 %Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. Revenues in the Americas and Europe also benefited from our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily the strengthening British Pound Sterling, had a negative impact on revenues outside of the Americas of approximately $91 million in fiscal 2020 compared to a positive impact of approximately $39 million in fiscal 2019. 40Table of ContentsCost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)20202019Subscription and support$3,198 $2,604 $594 Professional services and other1,037 847 190 Total cost of revenues$4,235 $3,451 $784 Percent of total revenues25 %26 %For fiscal 2020, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $245 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $43 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $213 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity and an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $225 million. Service delivery costs associated with perpetual and term software licenses is lower than our service delivery costs for our cloud service offerings and as a result, our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2020 benefited, in part, due to this shift in our business mix. We have increased our headcount by 30 percent since fiscal 2019 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods.Our professional services and other gross margin was positive $18 million during fiscal 2020 and positive $22 million during fiscal 2019. We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.Operating Expenses.

Our research and development headcount increased by 54 percent since fiscal 2019 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies, and integrate acquired companies. Our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase in headcount. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. For fiscal 2020, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 billion in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $209 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $120 million, and allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 36 percent since fiscal 2019, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase in headcount. We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel. For fiscal 2020, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 38 percent since fiscal 2019 as we added personnel to support our growth, and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase. We also incurred transaction costs associated with our 41Table of Contentsvarious acquisitions during fiscal 2020, including approximately $40 million from Tableau. During fiscal 2019, we incurred approximately $24 million of transaction costs from our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2019. As a result of the June 2019 Salesforce.org business combination, the Company effectively settled all existing agreements between the Company and Salesforce.org and, as part of business combination accounting, accordingly recorded a one-time, non-cash operating expense charge of approximately $166 million related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement.Other income and expense.

Net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on privately held equity securities of $208 million and unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of $138 million. In addition, net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 included gains of approximately $9 million and $39 million as a result of remeasuring our prior equity interest in MapAnything and ClickSoftware, respectively. Net gains recognized during fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of $345 million.Other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income. Interest expense was $131 million and $154 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Investment income increased $61 million in fiscal 2020 compared to the same periods a year ago due to higher interest income across our portfolio, which is primarily a result of the larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.

Our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. In fiscal 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of $127 million on a pretax income of $983 million. The tax benefit recognized was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we recognized tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019 and 2018For a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2019 compared to the year ended January 31, 2018, please refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2019.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $7.9 billion and accounts receivable of $6.2 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2020, our remaining performance obligation was $30.8 billion. Our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. 42Table of ContentsWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our revolving loan credit agreement that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured financing (""Credit Facility"") and unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.The adoption of the new lease accounting standard, Topic 842, has not impacted the cost of or limited our borrowing capacity from third party lenders.Cash FlowsFor fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 202020192018Net cash provided by operating activities $4,331 $3,398 $2,738 Net cash used in investing activities(2,980) (5,308) (2,011) Net cash provided by financing activities 164 2,010 221 Operating ActivitiesThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to net income of $126 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as $2.1 billion of depreciation and amortization, $1.8 billion of expenses related to employee stock plans, $0.9 billion of amortization of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts and discrete one-time non-cash adjustments. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 benefited from strong growth in the business and early payments from some of our larger customer contracts, offset by transaction and integration costs in connection with the acquisition of Tableau.The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily related to net income of $1.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $1.3 billion of expenses related to employee stock plans and $1.0 billion related to depreciation and amortization.Investing ActivitiesThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to the purchases of marketable securities of $3.9 billion and was offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.2 billion. In addition, we paid approximately $1.1 billion of cash consideration for business combinations during fiscal 2020, which was offset by approximately $644 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with the acquisition of Tableau, as well as approximately $110 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired in connection with other acquisitions. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily related to the acquisition of MuleSoft, Datorama and CloudCraze for $5.1 billion and was offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.6 billion.

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $3.0 billion from proceeds from issuance of debt to fund the acquisition of MuleSoft and $704 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $1.5 billion in repayments of debt. 43Table of ContentsDebtAs of January 31, 2020, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding due in 2023 and 2028 with a total carrying value of $2.5 billion. In addition, we had senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on 50 Fremont due in 2023 with a total carrying value of $193 million. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2020. We maintain a Credit Facility that matures in April 2023. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2020.We do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures, excluding all secured and unsecured debt.

The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.During fiscal 2020 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of such investments and continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.Other Future ObligationsIn February 2020, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of a cloud-based real-time personalization and customer data platform, for approximately $100 million of cash consideration.44Table of ContentsIn February 2020, the Company made a strategic investment of $150 million in cash for preferred shares of a technology company in a private placement.In November 2019, we entered into an agreement to purchase two real estate assets in San Francisco, California for approximately $150 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.In February 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Vlocity, Inc., a leading provider of industry-specific cloud and mobile software for approximately $1.33 billion of cash consideration. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.In October 2019, we acquired ClickSoftware for approximately $1.4 billion. In the event that we fully integrate the operations and assets of ClickSoftware, as well as other acquired Israeli based entities into our operations, we may be subject to a potential one-time income tax charge based on an assumed Israeli statutory tax rate of 23 percent applied to the value of any transferred intangibles. Our tax provision for fiscal 2020 reflects the estimated incremental tax costs associated with the integration of ClickSoftware’s operations and assets. The timing and amount of the cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation. Environmental, Social, GovernanceWe believe the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. Delivering innovative solutions to our customers is core to our mission and, as a technology company, we have developed solutions on the Salesforce Platform that enable our customers and stakeholders to manage and affect environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters that are meaningful to them. We also believe that transparently disclosing the goals and relevant metrics related to our ESG programs will allow our stakeholders to be informed on our progress. To this end, we are working to align with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (“FSB”) Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) and of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) by the end of fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, we completed an ESG materiality assessment, which identified key topics that are most important to our stakeholders and our success as a business. We expect to update this assessment on a periodic basis to ensure it reflects changes in our business and the external environment. The topics covered in this section include some of the key highlights from that assessment. We also publish an annual stakeholder impact report on our website detailing our overall strategy relating to ESG programs as well as our efforts in these areas.EnvironmentalProtecting our Planet: We are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future. Salesforce delivers all customers a carbon neutral cloud and we are committed to achieving 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations by the end of fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2020, we procured electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 63 percent of what we used globally. We have set an internal price on carbon by offsetting all of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the parts of our Scope 3 (indirect emissions) related to delivering a carbon neutral cloud and all employee commuting and business travel emissions. In addition, we had our 1.5 degree science-based target approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative. This included a supply chain engagement commitment whereby suppliers representing 60 percent of Salesforce’s Scope 3 emissions, covering all upstream emission categories, will set science-based targets by 2024.Salesforce Sustainability Cloud: We believe that our technology can play an important role in helping to drive climate action that will accelerate the world’s efforts towards carbon neutrality and, in fiscal 2020, we launched Salesforce Sustainability Cloud, a carbon accounting product for businesses and governments to track and manage their greenhouse gas emissions. SocialRecruiting and Managing a Global, Diverse and Skilled Workforce: Our culture is driven by our core values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality. We believe our company culture fosters open dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family, all of which allow us to attract and retain the best talent. We invest in programs designed to enhance employee success and create a safe, healthy and engaging working environment. Some examples include:•We review the salaries and bonuses of our global workforce on an annual basis to ensure everyone is paid equally for equal work and close any unexplained gaps. To date, we have spent $10.3 million intended to ensure equal pay for equal work. We also review differences in pay for not only gender, but also race and ethnicity in the United States;•We aspire to have 50 percent of our U.S. workforce made up of underrepresented groups (Women, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Multiracial, Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Trans, Queer, People with Disabilities, and Veterans) by 2023. As of October 31, 2019, 43.9 percent of our U.S. workforce was made up of underrepresented groups;45Table of Contents•We support 12 employee-led and founded employee resource groups, which provide a community for underrepresented groups and their allies, offer professional development and mentoring opportunities, and empower employees to be responsive equality leaders in their community. In fiscal 2020, nearly half of our employees engaged in one or more such resource groups.Workforce Development: Salesforce is committed to enabling the workforce to learn the skills needed to thrive in the jobs of today and tomorrow. Our free online learning platform, Trailhead, allows anyone to learn in-demand technology and business skills. To date, over 20 million badges have been earned on Trailhead.Ethical and Humane Use of Technology: We aspire to create technology that not only drives the success of our customers, but also upholds the basic human rights of every individual. Core to this effort is the establishment of the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology, working across product, law, policy, and ethics to develop and implement a strategic framework for the ethical and humane use of technology across Salesforce.Integrated Philanthropy: We believe that business is the greatest platform for change. Together with the Salesforce Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, to date we have given approximately $330 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 4.9 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 46,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount.Philanthropy Cloud: Philanthropy Cloud is an end-to-end solution for our customers employees’ philanthropy needs, including donations, volunteering, grants management, and pledge processing.Governance: Data Security: Customers entrust us with their most sensitive data, and they expect us to protect it using security risk management practices and advanced systems that respond to the changing security landscape and emerging threats. We have made and will continue to make substantial investments in our cybersecurity programs. We provide an overview of our program, training, best practices for our customers, and information on system status, security issues, and compliance certificates on our website at www.trust.salesforce.com. In addition, we believe that improvements in data security are critical to realizing the potential of technology and greater connectivity to improve lives around the world and that effective cybersecurity requires an ecosystem-wide approach. This is why we work with partners and stakeholders across the globe to support legislation and initiatives such as the Cybersecurity Tech Accord that would help modernize how we approach cybersecurity as an industry. Data Privacy: Our customers trust us to help them build meaningful relationships with their own customers. The privacy of the data that we are entrusted to protect is a top priority. Our customer agreements (templates of which are publicly available on our website) and our privacy policies (also publicly available on our website) describe how we safeguard data with an effective privacy and security program. We also offer resources to help our customers operate globally in compliance with privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA. Corporate Governance: We are committed to a corporate governance structure that promotes long-term stockholder value creation by providing a leadership structure and composition of the Board of Directors that is aligned with our strategic direction and providing our stockholders with both the opportunity to provide direct feedback and key substantive rights to ensure accountability. Governance is foundational to our ESG programs and we work actively with our Board of Directors on our initiatives. For example, our Audit and Finance Committee oversees cybersecurity matters and meets regularly with our Chief Trust Officer, and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees our ESG programs as set forth in its charter.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers, additional headcount in foreign countries and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. 46Table of ContentsOur European revenue, operating expenses and significant balance sheet accounts denominated in currencies other than the USD primarily flow through our United Kingdom (""UK"") subsidiary, which has a functional currency of the British Pound Sterling. This results in a two-step currency exchange process wherein the currencies in Europe other than the British Pound Sterling are first remeasured into the British Pound Sterling and then the British Pound Sterling is translated into USD for our Consolidated Financial Statements. As an example, costs incurred in France are remeasured from the Euro to the British Pound Sterling and then translated into the USD. Our statements of operations and balance sheet accounts are also impacted by the re-measurement of non-functional currency transactions such as USD denominated intercompany loans, cash accounts held by our overseas subsidiaries, accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies and unearned revenue and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies. In fiscal 2020, we began transitioning away from this UK-centralized European structure to enable some of our local subsidiaries within Europe, including Germany and France, to invoice customers directly. This transition, which may take multiple years, would thereby enable the local subsidiaries to recognize revenues, operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies. With the change to local invoicing in some markets, we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency.In January 2020, the UK exited the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”) and entered a transition period expected to last until the end of calendar 2020 during which the UK will continue to be subject to EU rules and regulations while it negotiates the future terms of its relationship with the EU. Brexit, and the outcome of these ongoing negotiations, could adversely affect the UK, regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro. We have evaluated and started to implement initiatives, such as the commitment to invest resources in Dublin, Ireland that could partially mitigate the impact Brexit could have on our operations. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 total revenues generated in Europe were approximately 20 percent, 19 percent and 18 percent of total revenues, respectively, of which substantially all were recorded in our UK subsidiary. Revenues in Europe were negatively impacted by approximately $79 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as a result of the strengthening British Pound Sterling. We recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of Brexit negotiations, and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business.Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815 (“ASC 815”), Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Although the USD fluctuated against certain international currencies over the past several months, the amounts of revenue and remaining performance obligation that we reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during the fiscal year using a constant currency rate.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $7.9 billion at January 31, 2020. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.47Table of ContentsOur cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2020 could result in a $38 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $21 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In addition, we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): InstrumentMaturity datePrincipal Outstanding as of January 31, 2020Interest Terms Effective interest rate for fiscal 2020 2023 Senior Notes April 2023$1,000 Fixed 3.26% 2028 Senior Notes April 20281,500Fixed 3.70% Loan assumed on 50 Fremont June 2023194Fixed3.75% Revolving credit facility April 20230Floating N/AThe borrowings under our revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.375% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.75% to 1.375%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. Our Revolving Credit Facility allows for the LIBOR rate to be phased-out and replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming LIBOR transition. Regardless of what amounts, if any, are outstanding under the Credit Facility, we are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.05% to 0.175%, with such rate being based on our credit rating, payable in arrears quarterly. As of January 31, 2020, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility. The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally. We primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators to create and expand our ecosystem. As the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change, our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings, as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies. We plan to continue these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive.As of January 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of investments in over 260 companies, with capital investments ranging from less than $0.3 million to approximately $300 million, and 27 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10 million. The following table sets forth additional information regarding active investments within our strategic investment 48Table of Contentsportfolio as of January 31, 2020 and excludes exited investments (in millions):Investment Type Capital Invested Unrealized Gains (Cumulative) Unrealized Losses (Cumulative)Carrying Value as of January 31, 2020Publicly held equity securities $249 $142 $(21) $370 Privately held equity securities 1,288 448 (193) 1,543 Total equity securities $1,537 $590 $(214) $1,913 We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio.Our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and preferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total company value. As such, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. For example, an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our significant publicly traded and privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2020, which represents 65% of the strategic investment portfolio, could result in a $97 million reduction to the investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment. We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. Currently, two of our five publicly held investments are subject to such a contractual obligation, which expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:37.660051

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.The following section generally discusses fiscal 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020, as well as certain fiscal 2019 items. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.OverviewWe are a global leader in customer relationship management (""CRM"") technology that brings companies and customers together. With our Customer 360 platform we deliver a single source of truth, connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce, from anywhere. Since our founding in 1999, we have pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and artificial intelligence (“AI”), enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere era. COVID-19 ImpactIn December 2019, the novel coronavirus and resulting disease (“COVID-19”) was first reported. After ongoing assessment of the rapid spread, number of cases and countries affected, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been guided by our core values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality. Beginning in the first fiscal quarter and through the remainder of fiscal 2021, we took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting our employees, helping our customers and communities and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. As a result of the pandemic, we experienced a slight decline in new business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same prior-year period; however, new business grew during the remainder of fiscal 2021 at rates consistent with historical trends prior to COVID-19. In addition, as a result of actions taken by us in response to the pandemic, we experienced incremental operating expenses and lower than expected operating cash flows for the full year of fiscal 2021, when compared to historical trends. For example, changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our go-to-market efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the year. In fiscal 2021, our income from operations benefited from our global work from home policy and limited business travel by our employees. We continue to evaluate our office space needs, and as a result we recorded approximately $216 million of impairments to assets associated with real estate 37Table of Contentsleases in select locations we have decided to exit, of which approximately $184 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. In addition, we have in the past implemented strategic realignments to position our company for future growth and will continue to do so, particularly as we evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on our business. As part of our current strategic realignment, we have redirected and may in the future redirect some resources from areas that no longer align with our business priorities into key growth and strategic areas, as well as to increase investments in our go-to-market and product efforts. As a result of these investments and redirection efforts, which included some position eliminations, we saw an increase in expenses in fiscal 2021. In addition, as we continue to evaluate our office space needs, we may record additional impairments to associated assets. As we adjust and refine our strategy, there may be additional investments and redirection efforts in the future. We do not yet know the impact the pandemic will have on our long-term revenue growth and profitability. Authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and could continue to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. These business slowdowns and shutdowns have impacted and may continue to impact our business and results of operations. For example, the extent and duration of these measures could impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents; have resulted in increased internet demand, which could cause access issues; could affect our ability to develop and support products and services; and could cause issues with access to data centers.The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance depends on certain developments, including the duration of the pandemic and any resurgences, the severity of the disease, responsive actions taken by public health officials, the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines, the impacts on our customers and our sales cycles, our ability to generate new business leads, the impacts on our customers, employee and industry events, and the effects on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and currently cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. As a result, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Due to our primarily subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. If the COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees’, partners’ or customers’ productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products and services may persist for an indefinite period, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.Highlights from the Fiscal Year 2021.•Revenue: Total fiscal 2021 revenue was $21.3 billion, an increase of 24 percent year-over-year. •Earnings per Share: Fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share was $4.38 as compared to earnings per share of $0.15 from a year ago, and was benefited by approximately $2.0 billion from the one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible property and an unrealized gain of $1.7 billion associated with the initial public offerings of two of our strategic investments. •Cash: Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2021 was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended fiscal 2021 at $12.0 billion. •Remaining Performance Obligation: Remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately $36.1 billion, an increase of 17 percent year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately $18.0 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year. •Acquisition: During fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Vlocity, Inc. (""Vlocity"") for $1.4 billion, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in cash. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we announced our pending acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (“Slack”), a leading channel-based messaging platform, which is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, for an estimated $15.6 billion in cash and 45 million shares of Salesforce common stock, based on Slack Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of January 31, 2021.We continue to invest for future growth and are focused on several key growth levers, including driving multi-cloud adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth drivers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics have lower attrition rates than our company average. 38Table of ContentsWe plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions. We regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services, technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings and to nurture the overall ecosystem for our offerings. Past acquisitions have enabled us to deliver innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. We continue to evaluate investment opportunities and expect to continue to make investments and acquisitions in the future, such as our pending acquisition of Slack. Slack has an integrated value proposition across all of our service offerings and, upon close of the transaction and successful product integration, we believe it will further enable companies to grow and succeed in an all-digital, work-from-anywhere era.As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income.We periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for long-term growth, which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity. In addition, we have experienced, and may at times in the future experience, more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business, which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions and increased enterprise solution selling activities. Slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.The expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets, including as a result of COVID-19, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on our revenue results for fiscal 2021. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on both our remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2021. We expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments. Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and related professional services. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2021. Subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, ""Cloud Services""). Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. With the May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft and the August 2019 acquisition of Tableau, subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses. Software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support are generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2021.The revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offering to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.Our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. As of January 31, 2021, our attrition rate, excluding our Integration service offering, Salesforce.org and Tableau, 39Table of Contentswas between 9.0% and 9.5%. Prior to fiscal year 2021, our attrition rate excluded our Commerce service offering. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully integrated into our customer success organization. While our attrition rate is difficult to predict, we expect it to remain consistent or slightly better in the near term due to the diversity of size, industry and geography within the customer base. However, our attrition rate may increase over time, including, for example, as a result of COVID-19. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Conversely, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. In response to COVID-19, we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and changed billing frequencies for other customers throughout fiscal 2021, which has delayed payments to periods later than expected. We also have accelerated our investments in our go-to-market and product efforts throughout fiscal 2021, which resulted in increased expenses and a negative impact to operating cash flow. These efforts have affected and may continue to affect trends related to the seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. The sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions).40Table of ContentsRemaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration can impact remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation.Remaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):41Table of ContentsCost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesImpact of AcquisitionsThe comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of Vlocity in June 2020 and our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019. Expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data and employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and certain third-party fees. We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and allocated overhead. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. Payments of these commissions are not consistent with the period in which the expense is recognized.General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees. 42Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct.We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (""SSP"") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts. Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. Significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. Therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;•discount rates;•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; •fair value of assumed equity awards; and•fair value of pre-existing relationships.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.43Table of ContentsIncome Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.In fiscal 2021, we changed our international corporate structure, which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value. In determining the estimated fair value of the intangible property, we made significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, projected revenues, operating expenses and geographic earnings mix in the valuation models. We believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, and will regularly evaluate its realizability.Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.The particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2021 could result in a $66 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio.44Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021% of Total Revenues2020% of Total Revenues2019% of Total RevenuesRevenues:Subscription and support$19,976 94 %$16,043 94 %$12,413 93 %Professional services and other1,276 6 1,055 6 869 7 Total revenues21,252 100 17,098 100 13,282 100 Cost of revenues (1)(2):Subscription and support 4,154 20 3,198 19 2,604 20 Professional services and other 1,284 6 1,037 6 847 6 Total cost of revenues5,438 26 4,235 25 3,451 26 Gross profit15,814 74 12,863 75 9,831 74 Operating expenses (1)(2):Research and development3,598 17 2,766 16 1,886 14 Marketing and sales9,674 45 7,930 46 6,064 46 General and administrative2,087 10 1,704 10 1,346 10 Loss on settlement of Salesforce.org reseller agreement0 0 166 1 0 0 Total operating expenses15,359 72 12,566 73 9,296 70 Income from operations455 2 297 2 535 4 Gains on strategic investments, net (3)2,170 10 427 2 542 4 Other expense(64)0 (18)0 (94)(1)Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes2,561 12 706 4 983 7 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (4)1,511 7 (580)(3)127 1 Net income$4,072 19 %$126 1 %$1,110 8 %45Table of Contents(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021% of Total Revenues2020% of Total Revenues2019% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$662 3 %$440 3 %$215 2 %Marketing and sales459 2 %352 2 232 2 (2) Amounts related to stock-based expenses, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021% of Total Revenues2020% of Total Revenues2019% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$241 1 %$204 1 %$161 1 %Research and development703 4 510 3 307 2 Marketing and sales941 4 852 5 643 5 General and administrative305 1 219 1 172 1 (3) During fiscal 2021, two of our strategic investments completed their initial public offering, resulting in an unrealized gain of $1.7 billion as of January 31, 2021.(4) Amounts include approximately $2.0 billion of one-time benefit from a discrete tax item related to the recognition of deferred tax assets resulting from an intra-entity transfer of intangible property in fiscal 2021, and a benefit related to the partial release of the valuation allowance of $612 million for fiscal 2019.

Impact of AcquisitionsThe comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the same period of fiscal 2020 was impacted by our acquisitions in the current and prior year, including the acquisition of Tableau in the prior year, which was our largest acquisition to date. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2020, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the fiscal year subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020Revenues Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Variance(in millions)20212020DollarsPercentSubscription and support$19,976 $16,043 $3,933 25 %Professional services and other1,276 1,055 221 21 Total revenues$21,252 $17,098 $4,154 24 The increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. Pricing was 46Table of Contentsnot a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. Revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately six percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2021. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.The acquisition of Tableau in August 2019 contributed approximately $1.5 billion and $652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, and is included in the above amounts. As a result of our business combination activity, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.Subscription and Support Revenue by Service OfferingSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 20212020Variance PercentSales $5,191 $4,598 13%Service5,377 4,466 20%Platform and Other6,275 4,473 40%Marketing and Commerce 3,133 2,506 25%Total$19,976 $16,043 Our Industry Offerings revenue is included in either Sales, Service or Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased. Subscription and support revenues from Platform and Other benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of Tableau in fiscal 2021 as compared to six months in fiscal 2020. The revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings have been and may be impacted by COVID-19 in the future, depending on our customers’ actual and projected business needs. For example, we experienced increased demand for our Marketing and Commerce service offering for fiscal 2021 when compared to prior periods.Revenues by geography were as follows: Fiscal Year Ended January 31,(in millions)2021As a % of Total Revenues2020As a % of Total RevenuesGrowth RateAmericas$14,736 69 %$12,051 71 %22 %Europe4,501 21 3,430 20 31 Asia Pacific2,015 10 1,617 9 25 Total$21,252 100 %$17,098 100 %Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. The increase in Americas revenues was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services and the investment of additional sales resources. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international sales resources. Revenues in the Americas and Europe also benefited from our acquisition of Tableau in August 2019. Foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2021 and 2020. Cost of Revenues.

Service delivery costs associated with our perpetual and term software licenses are lower than service delivery costs associated with our cloud service offerings and as a result, our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2021 benefited, in part, due to this shift in our business mix.We have increased our headcount associated with our data centers, customer support, and professional services by 18 percent since fiscal 2020 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods.Operating Expenses.

Our research and development headcount increased by 11 percent since fiscal 2020 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. For fiscal 2021, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.4 billion in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $89 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $107 million, and allocated overhead partially offset by a reduction in employee travel and expenses. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2021 were also negatively impacted by the one-time partial minimum commission guarantee offered to our direct sales force. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 14 percent since fiscal 2020, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel. We also expect an increase in marketing and sales expenses due to the gradual increase of travel and related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2022.For fiscal 2021, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs as well as being impacted by our charitable donations to members of our ecosystem and community. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 12 percent since fiscal 2020 as we added personnel to support our growth. While not material to date, we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessments. As a result of the June 2019 Salesforce.org business combination, we effectively settled all existing agreements between ourselves and Salesforce.org and, as part of business combination accounting, accordingly recorded a one-time, non-cash operating expense charge of approximately $166 million in fiscal 2020 related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement.48Table of ContentsOther income and expense.

Net gains recognized during fiscal 2021 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded equity securities of $1.7 billion and realized gains on sales of equity securities of $0.4 billion.Other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income. Interest expense was $126 million and $131 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Investment income decreased $34 million in fiscal 2021, respectively, compared to the same period a year ago due to lower interest rates across our portfolio, modestly offset by larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Upon closing of our acquisition of Slack, we expect an increase in interest expense due to debt agreements we plan to enter into in connection with the pending acquisition.Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we changed our international corporate structure, which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value. The determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and judgmental due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management. The tax amortization related to the intellectual property transferred will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely under Irish tax laws. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the currently enacted Irish tax rate. We believe that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in Ireland. In fiscal 2020, we recognized a tax provision of $580 million on a pretax income of $706 million. Our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States.Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019For a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.0 billion and accounts receivable of $7.8 billion. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Our Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides the ability to borrow up to $3.0 billion in unsecured financing (“Credit Facility”) as of January 31, 2021, also serves as a source of liquidity. As of January 31, 2021, our remaining performance obligation was $36.1 billion. Our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. 49Table of ContentsCash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to have a sufficient combination of available cash and borrowing capacity to fund the aggregate cash portion of the pending acquisition of Slack, which is expected to be approximately $15.6 billion. Sources of financing associated with our pending acquisition of Slack are detailed below in “Debt.”In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments. Cash FlowsFor fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$4,801 $4,331 $3,398 Net cash used in investing activities(3,971)(2,980)(5,308)Net cash provided by financing activities1,194 164 2,010 Operating ActivitiesThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to net income of $4.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items including $2.0 billion from a one-time discrete tax item from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of certain intangible property, $2.8 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.2 billion of expenses related to employee stock plans, as well as adjusted for $2.2 billion of gains on strategic investments. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $1.9 billion, offset by a change in accounts receivable, net of $1.6 billion. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was negatively impacted by changes in billing frequency for new business due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to net income of $126 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as $2.1 billion related to depreciation and amortization, $1.8 billion of expenses related to employee stock plans and discrete one-time non-cash adjustments.Investing ActivitiesThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisition of Vlocity, net of cash acquired, of approximately $1.2 billion as well as purchases of marketable securities of $4.8 billion, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.9 billion. In addition, we paid approximately $150 million of cash consideration related to the purchase of the property located at 450 Mission Street (“450 Mission”) in San Francisco, CA, which is reflected in capital expenditures. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to the purchases of marketable securities of $3.9 billion, offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.2 billion. In addition, we paid approximately $0.4 billion of cash consideration, net of cash acquired, for business combinations during fiscal 2020.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of $1.3 billion from proceeds from equity plans. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of $840 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by repayments of debt of $503 million, including repayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility that would have matured in April 2021, and principal payments on financing obligations of $173 million. 50Table of ContentsDebtAs of January 31, 2021, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding due in 2023 and 2028 with a total carrying value of $2.5 billion. In addition, we had senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on our purchase of an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco (“50 Fremont”), due in 2023 with a total carrying value of $190 million. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2021. In December 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in December 2025, replacing our previous $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2021. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, financing the considerations for and fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition.In addition, in connection with our pending acquisition of Slack, in December 2020, we obtained commitments from certain financial institutions for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Facility”). The original commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility were $10.0 billion, but were reduced to $7.0 billion in December 2020 following our entry into a $3.0 billion three-year senior unsecured loan agreement (“Acquisition Term Loan”), the proceeds of which may be used to finance a portion of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of Slack, for the repayment of certain debt of Slack to pay fees, costs and expenses related thereto. In February 2021, we elected to further reduce our Bridge Facility commitments to $4.0 billion. The availability and funding of the Bridge Facility and the Acquisition Term Loan are conditioned on the consummation of the acquisition of Slack in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and are subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and certain other conditions. We may further reduce the commitments in respect of the Bridge Facility prior to the consummation of the acquisition, all or a portion of which may be in connection with the issuance of one or more series of senior secured debt securities or other incurrences of new indebtedness or commitments in respect thereof. We do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. For more information regarding our lease obligations, see Note 6 “Leases and Other Commitments” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II. In addition, we have a substantial level of debt. For more information regarding our debt service obligations, see Note 9 “Debt” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II. As of January 31, 2021, our other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms were payments of $0.6 billion due in the next 12 months and $1.9 billion due thereafter. We expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operations and cash on our balance sheet.During fiscal 2021 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. While we continue to make investments in our infrastructure including offices, information technology and data centers to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of our investments including in response to the known and potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business.Other Future ObligationsIn December 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Slack. Under the terms of the agreement, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each outstanding share of Slack Class A and Class B common stock, resulting in an estimated $15.6 billion of cash consideration and 45 million shares to be issued, based on Slack Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of January 31, 2021. The agreement also provides for the assumption of outstanding equity awards held by Slack employees. We expect to fund the cash portion of the consideration with a combination of new debt, as discussed above, and cash on our balance sheet. In February 2021, we acquired all outstanding stock of Acumen Solutions, Inc. (“Acumen”) for approximately $433 million, in cash.In October 2019, we acquired ClickSoftware for approximately $1.4 billion. In the event that we fully integrate the operations and assets of ClickSoftware, as well as other acquired Israeli based entities into our operations, we may be subject to a potential one-time income tax charge based on an assumed Israeli statutory tax rate of 23 percent applied to the value of any transferred intangibles. The timing and amount of the cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation. 51Table of ContentsEnvironmental, Social, Governance We believe the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that values drive value, and that effectively managing our priority Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) topics will help create long-term value for our investors. We also believe that transparently disclosing the goals and relevant metrics related to our ESG programs will allow our stakeholders to be informed about our progress.The topics covered in this section are informed by an internal ESG materiality assessment completed in fiscal 2020, which assessed both the impact on our business and the importance to our stakeholders, as well as by relevant topics identified through third-party ESG reporting frameworks, standards and metrics, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”), and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). More information on our key ESG programs, goals and commitments, and key metrics can be found on our website in our annual Stakeholder Impact Report.Our ESG highlights as of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 include the following:COVID-19 Response. In fiscal 2021 we mobilized to support our employees, our customers and our communities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways. •Protecting our workforce. In an effort to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, we closed our offices around the world and provided an allowance for employees to use for equipment to improve their ability to work from home. We provided regular communication and updates to employees, including through company-wide video calls led by senior management, with participation of Board members and guest experts in psychology and other medical fields throughout fiscal 2021. Additionally, we expanded our leave programs to include accommodations for child or elder care hardships during the pandemic.•Innovation and customer support. To support our customers, we launched Work.com, which includes new solutions designed to help our customers reopen safely. We also launched Work.com for schools to help schools reopen safely and Vaccine Cloud to help governments and healthcare organizations more safely and efficiently manage vaccine programs at scale.•Supporting our communities. In fiscal 2021, we took action to help address the Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) shortage facing medical personnel by sourcing millions of units of PPE for doctors, nurses and first responders in the United States and other countries.Data Security. Customers entrust us with their most sensitive data, and they expect us to protect it using security risk management practices and advanced systems that respond to the changing security landscape and emerging threats. We have made and will continue to make substantial investments in our cybersecurity programs. We provide an overview of our program, training, best practices for our customers, and information on system status, security issues, and compliance certificates on our website at www.trust.salesforce.com.Data Privacy. Our customers trust us to help them build meaningful relationships with their own customers. The privacy of the data that we are entrusted to protect is a top priority. Our customer agreements and our privacy policies (which are publicly available on our website) describe how we safeguard data with an effective privacy and security program. We also offer resources to help our customers operate globally in compliance with privacy laws such as General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Equality. We invest in programs designed to enhance employee success and create a safe, healthy and engaging working environment that fosters our core value of equality for all. Refer to our “Human Capital Management” Section in Item 1 of Part I for details. Racial Equality and Justice Task Force. In fiscal 2021 we launched our Racial Equality and Justice Task Force to help drive systemic change in our workplace and community. To create the task force, we invited employees from across the business, as well as leaders of our Black employee resource group, to help guide our vision, which includes our focus on the four pillars of “People, Purchasing, Philanthropy and Policy.” Our vision and goals have been formalized in a new Racial Equality and Justice V2MOM, which is an internal management tool that incorporates our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures.Ethical and Humane Use. We recognize the transformative power of technologies and the importance of ensuring their ethical and humane use. Core to this effort is our Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology, which works across product, law, policy and ethics to develop and implement strategic frameworks across the company for the responsible design, development and use of Salesforce technologies. We regularly engage with stakeholders and experts in the field to further this effort. We also rely on our Ethical Use Advisory Council, composed of diverse frontline and executive employees, as well as external academics, industry experts and society leaders, to navigate how we mitigate risk and avoid harmful unintended consequences.Civic Engagement. We work with policymakers and elected officials around the globe on issues that matter to our stakeholders, including our employees, our customers, our stockholders, our communities and the environment. Salesforce is nonpartisan in our work, and we support candidates and eligible organizations of any party who share our priorities, align with our core values, represent and engage with significant numbers of our employees and demonstrate leadership. We are 52Table of Contentscommitted to complying with all laws, rules and regulations relevant to our political activity and we publicly disclose all contributions in the U.S. in reports filed with the Federal Election Commission and with various state campaign finance commissions. Our Governance Committee provides independent oversight and annually reviews our political contributions. Management prepares a detailed annual report of our corporate political spending, which is publicly accessible at https://www.salesforce.com/company/public-policy/. Supporting Our Communities. Giving back is foundational to our corporate culture and our core value of equality. In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, together with the Salesforce Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, our social value contribution include the following:•Approximately $1.4 billion in donated or discounted products provided to non-profits and higher education institutions via Salesforce.org. We calculate the social value of products sold or donated based on the estimated price we would have received if a comparable product was sold to a for-profit business of similar size and location, less the price that we received, if any, for the same product from a qualified non-profit educational institution or other Non-Government Organization (“NGO”). When a comparable Salesforce product price was not readily available, we used a ratio based on the weighted average of the Salesforce price to a for-profit company compared to the Salesforce price to a non-profit company.•Approximately $100 million in grants and donations to qualified non-profits, educational institutions or other NGOs in fiscal 2021.In addition, our employees volunteered over 800,000 hours in fiscal 2021.Climate Action. Salesforce continues to support science-based climate policies and decarbonization actions intended to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.•In fiscal 2021 our absolute location-based GHG emissions declined one percent relative to fiscal 2020. Market-based emissions, which include the net carbon reductions associated with our renewable energy procurement, declined by 40 percent over the same period. In fiscal 2021, we procured electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to approximately 75 percent of what we used globally. We continued to support new efforts to decarbonize regional energy grids through our first international Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (“VPPA”) in Australia. This VPPA supports our ambition to achieve our 100 percent renewable energy goal by 2022.•As part of our 1.5°C Science-Based Target, we made a commitment that suppliers representing 60% of our Scope 3 emissions will set Science-Based Targets of their own. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, 49 and 19 of our suppliers had set or committed to Science-Based Targets, respectively. In addition, in fiscal 2021 we delivered all customers a carbon neutral cloud, offset all operational emissions and offset all emissions associated with business travel and employee commuting.•In January 2020, as a founding partner of 1t.org, and in support of its mission, Salesforce announced our goal to support and mobilize the conservation, restoration and growth of 100 million trees by the end of 2030. While we believe all of these goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities, they are aspirational and may change, and there is no guarantee or promise that they will be met.53Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment risks. This exposure has increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of COVID-19 as discussed in more detail below.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change, including market impacts associated with COVID-19. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. In fiscal 2020, we began transitioning away from our UK-centralized European structure to enable some of our local subsidiaries within Europe, including Germany and France, to invoice customers directly. This transition, which may take multiple years, is expected to enable local subsidiaries to recognize revenues, operating expenses and corresponding balance sheet accounts in local currencies. With the change to local invoicing in some markets, we expect better alignment between our revenue and expenses in the local currency.In January 2020, the UK exited the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”). In December 2020, a trade agreement was entered into between the UK and the EU and in January 2021, the transition period ended and the UK was no longer subject to EU rules or regulations. Brexit and the new UK-EU trade agreement could adversely affect the UK, regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro. We have evaluated and started to implement initiatives, such as the commitment to invest resources in Dublin, Ireland that could partially mitigate the impact Brexit could have on our operations. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, revenues generated in Europe were approximately 21 percent and 20 percent of total revenues, respectively, of which most are recorded in our UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Ireland subsidiaries. Revenues in Europe had a minimal favorable impact in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as a result of fluctuations in the Euro and British Pound Sterling against the USD. We recognize that there are still significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of Brexit negotiations, and we will continue to monitor any changes that may arise and assess their potential impact on our business.Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Although the USD fluctuated against certain international currencies throughout the year, the amounts of revenue that we reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies were similar to what we would have reported during fiscal 2020 using a constant currency rate. However, fluctuations in USD against certain international currencies over the past several months modestly benefited our remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2021 compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2020 using constant currency rate. 54Table of ContentsInterest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.0 billion as of January 31, 2021. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses. Our fixed-income portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2021 could result in a $63 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $7.9 billion. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $38 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. In addition, we maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): InstrumentMaturity DatePrincipal Outstanding as of January 31, 2021Interest TermsEffective Interest Rate for Fiscal 2021Bridge FacilityN/A (1)$0 FloatingN/AAcquisition Term LoanN/A (2)0 FloatingN/A2023 Senior NotesApril 20231,000Fixed3.26%2028 Senior NotesApril 20281,500Fixed3.70%Loan assumed on 50 FremontJune 2023190Fixed3.75%Credit FacilityDecember 20250FloatingN/A(1) Maturity date will be 364 days following the closing of the pending Slack acquisition.(2) Maturity date is three years following the closing of the pending Slack acquisition.Any borrowings under the Bridge Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.875% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.125%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit ratings from time to time and subject to increases of 0.25% on each of the 90th, 180th and 270th day following the initial funding of the Bridge Facility. As of January 31, 2021, there was no outstanding borrowing amounts under the Bridge Facility.Any borrowings under our Acquisition Term Loan bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.125% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.125%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit ratings from time to time. Our Acquisition Term Loan allows for the LIBOR rate to be phased out and replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming LIBOR transition. As of January 31, 2021, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Acquisition Term Loan.The borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.125% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.125%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. Our Credit Facility allows for the LIBOR rate to be phased out and replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming LIBOR transition. We are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts. As of January 31, 2021, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility.The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our 55Table of Contentscounterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally, including in emerging markets. We primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators to advance and expand our ecosystem. As the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change, our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings, as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies. We plan to continue these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive. Our strategy includes using proceeds from realized gains recognized on the sales of our existing strategic investments to, in part, fund these new strategic investments. As of January 31, 2021, our portfolio consisted of investments in over 280 companies, with capital investments ranging from less than $0.3 million to approximately $335 million, and 40 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately $10 million. As of January 31, 2021, we held one publicly traded investment with a carrying value that was approximately 35 percent of our total strategic investments, one publicly traded investment with a carrying value that was greater than 15 percent of our total strategic investments, and one privately held investment with a carrying value greater than five percent of our strategic investment portfolio. The following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of January 31, 2021 and excludes exited investments (in millions):Investment Type Capital Invested Unrealized Gains (Cumulative) Unrealized Losses (Cumulative)Carrying Value as of January 31, 2021Publicly held equity securities $418 $1,650 $0 $2,068 Privately held equity securities 1,720 318 (248)1,790 Total equity securities$2,138 $1,968 $(248)$3,858 We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio. Volatility in the global market conditions, including recent and ongoing volatility related to the impacts of COVID-19 and related public health measures, may impact our investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations.Our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and preferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our publicly traded and significant privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2021, which represents 74 percent of the strategic investment portfolio, could result in a $272 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment.We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. One of our publicly traded investments, which individually had a carrying value of approximately 35 percent of our total strategic investment portfolio, is subject to lock-up agreements until March 2021, for the investment made prior to their initial public offering (“IPO”) and September 2021 for the investment made concurrent with their IPO. A portion of our holdings was released from the lock-up agreement early as certain criteria were met. In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital. The rapid spread of COVID-19 and its reverberating effects on the global economy have caused disruptions to the industry and to financial markets that are inhibiting and may continue to inhibit the ability of investee companies to complete a liquidity event. In severe cases, our investee companies may no longer be able to operate or could experience reduced profitability, delayed public offerings, reduced ability to raise favorable rounds of financing, or acquisitions at less favorable 56Table of Contentsterms. These outcomes could have a material adverse affect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.57Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:30.566019
1108524,CRM,"Salesforce, Inc.",2022,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.The following section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021, as well as certain fiscal 2020 items. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.OverviewWe are a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that brings companies and customers together in the digital age. Founded in 1999, we enable companies of every size and industry to take advantage of powerful technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, voice, blockchain and artificial intelligence to connect to their customers in a whole new way and help them transform their businesses around the customer in this digital-first world.With our Customer 360 platform, we deliver a single source of truth, connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to help companies with their digital transformation. Customer 360 gives teams sales, service, marketing and commerce capabilities and more, and a single shared view of their customers so they can work together to build lasting, trusted relationships and deliver the personalized experiences their customers expect. And with our acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (“Slack”) in July 2021, we are creating a new digital headquarters, one where companies, employees, governments, and stakeholders can create success from anywhere.COVID-19 ImpactIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus and resulting disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. This pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.As our employees, customers and partners begin to work in person on a periodic basis, we have launched our Success from Anywhere initiative and leveraged Flex Team Agreements to decide how, when, and where our employees work. Using Slack as our digital headquarters, regardless of where employees work, employees are able to connect, share information and get work done. As we adopt and refine our Success from Anywhere initiatives, there may be additional investments and redirection efforts in the future which may include position eliminations, incremental costs to improve employees’ ability to work from home and impairments to assets associated with real estate leases in select locations we decide to exit.See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.Highlights from Fiscal Year 2022•Revenue: For fiscal 2022, revenue was $26.5 billion, an increase of 25 percent year-over-year. •Earnings per Share: For fiscal 2022, diluted earnings per share was $1.48 as compared to earnings per share of $4.38 from a year ago. Fiscal 2021 results benefited from a $2.0 billion one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible property. •Cash: Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2022 was $6.0 billion, an increase of 25 percent year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2022 was $10.5 billion. •Remaining Performance Obligation: Total remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2022 was approximately $43.7 billion, which includes approximately $1.2 billion of remaining performance obligation related to Slack, an increase of 21 percent year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2022 was approximately $22.0 billion, an increase of 22 percent year-over-year. We continue to invest for future growth and are focused on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with 37Table of Contentsmore vertical software solutions. These growth drivers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics have lower attrition rates than our company average. We plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions. We evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings and to nurture the overall ecosystem for our offerings. Past acquisitions have enabled us to deliver innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, integration and collaboration. We expect to make investments and acquisitions in the future to continue our growth and expand our service offerings and our professional services organization in supporting the adoption of our service offerings.As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income.We periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for long-term growth, which has in the past, and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity. In addition, we have experienced, and may at times in the future experience, more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business, which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions and increased enterprise solution selling activities. Slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.The expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets, including as a result of COVID-19, inflation and Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Foreign currency fluctuations benefited revenues by approximately one percent in fiscal 2022. Fluctuations in the United States Dollar against international currencies negatively impacted our remaining performance obligation by approximately two percent as of January 31, 2022 compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2021 using constant currency rates. Recently the USD has strengthened against certain foreign currencies in the markets in which we operate. If these conditions continue or materially worsen, they could have an impact on our future results and our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations could also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2022, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion about our segments. Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2022. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, ""Cloud Services""), software license revenues from the sales of term and perpetual licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term and perpetual software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2022.The revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our 38Table of Contentscustomers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offering to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.Our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. As of January 31, 2022, our attrition rate, excluding MuleSoft, Salesforce.org, Tableau and Slack, was between 7.0 and 7.5 percent. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, our attrition rate includes our Commerce service offering. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully integrated into our customer success organization. While our attrition rate is difficult to predict, we expect it to remain consistent for the near term due to the diversity of size, industry and geography within the customer base. However, our attrition rate may increase over time, including, for example, as a result of COVID-19. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. In response to COVID-19, we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and changed billing frequencies for other customers throughout fiscal 2021, which delayed payments to periods later than expected. We also accelerated our investments in our go-to-market and product efforts throughout fiscal 2021, which resulted in increased expenses and a negative impact to operating cash flow. These efforts have affected and may continue to affect trends related to the seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow. 39Table of ContentsThe sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions).Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.40Table of ContentsRemaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):(1) Includes approximately $1.2 billion of remaining performance obligation related to Slack.(2) Includes approximately $0.9 billion of remaining performance obligation related to Slack.(3) Includes approximately $0.8 billion of remaining performance obligation related to Slack. Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of RevenuesCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations.Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expense, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expense and allocated overhead. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expense and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. As such, the timing of expense recognition for these commissions is not consistent with the timing of the associated cash payment. Our marketing and sales expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. 41Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expense, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, these types of expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have generally concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (""SSP"") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts. Costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts, primarily commissions paid to employees and related payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs, are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. Significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. Therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;42Table of Contents•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;•discount rates;•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; •fair value of assumed equity awards; and•fair value of pre-existing relationships.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing models (“OPM”), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity.We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.The particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in the enterprise values of our largest privately held equity securities, representing 41 percent of our total strategic investments as of January 31, 2022, could result in a $165 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio.43Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022% of Total Revenues2021% of Total Revenues2020% of Total RevenuesRevenues:Subscription and support$24,657 93 %$19,976 94 %$16,043 94 %Professional services and other1,835 7 1,276 6 1,055 6 Total revenues26,492 100 21,252 100 17,098 100 Cost of revenues (1)(2):Subscription and support 5,059 19 4,154 20 3,198 19 Professional services and other 1,967 8 1,284 6 1,037 6 Total cost of revenues7,026 27 5,438 26 4,235 25 Gross profit19,466 73 15,814 74 12,863 75 Operating expenses (1)(2):Research and development4,465 17 3,598 17 2,766 16 Marketing and sales11,855 44 9,674 45 7,930 46 General and administrative2,598 10 2,087 10 1,704 10 Loss on settlement of Salesforce.org reseller agreement0 0 0 0 166 1 Total operating expenses18,918 71 15,359 72 12,566 73 Income from operations548 2 455 2 297 2 Gains on strategic investments, net 1,211 5 2,170 10 427 2 Other expense(227)(1)(64)0 (18)0 Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes1,532 6 2,561 12 706 4 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (3)(88)(1)1,511 7 (580)(3)Net income$1,444 5 %$4,072 19 %$126 1 %(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022% of Total Revenues2021% of Total Revenues2020% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$897 3 %$662 3 %$440 3 %Marketing and sales727 3 459 2 352 2 (2) Amounts related to stock-based expense, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022% of Total Revenues2021% of Total Revenues2020% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$386 1 %$241 1 %$204 1 %Research and development918 4 703 4 510 3 Marketing and sales1,104 4 941 4 852 5 General and administrative371 1 305 1 219 1 (3) Amounts include approximately $2.0 billion of one-time benefit from a discrete tax item related to the recognition of deferred tax assets resulting from an intra-entity transfer of intangible property in fiscal 2021.44Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions): As of January 31, 2022January 31, 2021Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$10,537 $11,966 Unearned revenue15,628 12,607 Remaining performance obligation43.7 36.1 Principal due on our outstanding debt obligations (1)10,686 2,690 (1) Amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations.Remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the same period of fiscal 2021 was impacted by our recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of Slack in July 2021, our largest acquisition to date. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2021, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date for the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 and 2021Revenues Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Variance(in millions)20222021DollarsPercentSubscription and support$24,657 $19,976 $4,681 23 %Professional services and other1,835 1,276 559 44 Total revenues$26,492 $21,252 $5,240 25 The increase in subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2022 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for either period. Revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately seven percent and six percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 and 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.The acquisition of Slack in July 2021 contributed approximately $584 million to subscription and support revenues during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. As a result of our business combination activity, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers as well as revenues resulting from the Acumen Solutions, Inc. (“Acumen”) acquisition in February 2021. 45Table of ContentsSubscription and Support Revenues by Service OfferingSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 20222021Variance PercentSales $5,989 $5,191 15%Service6,474 5,377 20%Platform and Other4,509 3,324 36%Marketing and Commerce 3,902 3,133 25%Data3,783 2,951 28%Total$24,657 $19,976 Our Industry Offerings revenue is included in one of the above service offerings depending on the primary service purchased.

Reclassifications to prior period Platform and Other revenues were made to conform to the current period presentation.Data subscription and support revenues include revenues from term and perpetual software licenses which are recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Therefore, we expect Data to experience more volatility period to period compared to our other service offerings. In addition, we recently made changes that impacted our MuleSoft sales organization which we expect to have long-term benefits, but created greater short-term disruption than anticipated. This disruption impacted Data revenues during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, due to the timing of revenue recognition associated with the sale of MuleSoft term and perpetual software licenses.Revenues by Geography Fiscal Year Ended January 31,(in millions)2022As a % of Total Revenues2021As a % of Total RevenuesGrowth RateAmericas$17,983 68 %$14,736 69 %22 %Europe6,016 23 4,501 21 34 Asia Pacific2,493 9 2,015 10 24 Total$26,492 100 %$21,252 100 %Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. The increase in Americas revenues was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services and the investment of additional sales resources. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. Fiscal 2022 revenues outside of the Americas were positively impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations by approximately two percent compared to fiscal 2021. 46Table of ContentsCost of Revenues Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)20222021Subscription and support$5,059 $4,154 $905 Professional services and other1,967 1,284 683 Total cost of revenues$7,026 $5,438 $1,588 Percent of total revenues27 %26 %For fiscal 2022, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $645 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $235 million in amortization of purchased intangibles from business combination, an increase of $145 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $284 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, and an increase in third party fees. We have increased our headcount associated with our data centers, customer support and professional services by 43 percent since fiscal 2021 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, and our fiscal 2022 acquisition of Acumen also contributed to this increase. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods.Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)20222021Research and development$4,465 $3,598 $867 Marketing and sales11,855 9,674 2,181 General and administrative2,598 2,087 511 Total operating expenses$18,918 $15,359 $3,559 Percent of total revenues71 %72 % For fiscal 2022, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $501 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $215 million in stock-based expenses, increases in our development and test data center costs. Our research and development headcount increased by 28 percent since fiscal 2021 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies. Our recent acquisition of Slack also contributed to this increase in headcount. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. For fiscal 2022, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 billion in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $268 million in amortization of purchased intangibles from business combination, and an increase of $163 million in stock-based expense. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 26 percent since fiscal 2021, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Our recent acquisition of Slack also contributed to this increase in headcount. We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and will increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel and invest in go-to-market efforts. For fiscal 2022, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 27 percent since fiscal 2021 as we added personnel to support our growth. Our recent acquisition of Slack also contributed to this increase in headcount.47Table of ContentsOther Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)20222021Gains on strategic investments, net$1,211 $2,170 $(959)Other expense(227)(64)(163)Gains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. Net gains recognized during fiscal 2022 included a $369 million unrealized gain on one of our privately held equity investments and a $155 million realized gain resulting from a publicly traded company acquiring one of the Company’s privately held equity investments in a stock and cash transaction.Other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our finance leases offset by investment income. Interest expense was $220 million and $126 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by our issuance of $8.0 billion of Senior Notes in July 2021. Benefit From (Provision For) Income Taxes Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)20222021Benefit from (provision for) income taxes$(88)$1,511 $(1,599)Effective tax rate6 %(59)%In fiscal 2022, we recognized a tax provision of $88 million on a pretax income of $1.5 billion. Our tax provision was due to taxes from profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States, which was offset by a net U.S tax benefit primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.In fiscal 2021, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.5 billion on a pretax income of $2.6 billion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we changed our international corporate structure, which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property’s current fair value. The determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and subject to judgement due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management. The tax amortization related to the intellectual property transferred will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely under Irish tax laws. The deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the currently enacted Irish tax rate. We believe that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in Ireland.Additionally, the provision from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development costs will become effective starting fiscal 2023. If not deferred, modified or repealed, this provision is expected to materially increase future cash taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020For a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2021.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $10.5 billion and accounts receivable of $9.7 billion. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Our credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which as of January 31, 2022 provides the ability to borrow up to $3.0 billion in unsecured financing (the “Credit Facility”), also serves as a source of liquidity. Cash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months. 48Table of ContentsIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.Cash FlowsFor fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 our cash flows were as follows (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$6,000 $4,801 $4,331 Net cash used in investing activities(14,536)(3,971)(2,980)Net cash provided by financing activities7,838 1,194 164 Operating ActivitiesThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily related to net income of $1.4 billion, adjusted for non-cash items including $3.3 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 billion related to stock-based expense offset by $1.2 billion related to gains on strategic investments. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $2.6 billion, partially offset by a change in accounts receivable, net of $1.8 billion.The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to net income of $4.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $2.8 billion related to depreciation and amortization and $2.2 billion of expenses related to stock-based expense offset by $2.0 billion from a one-time discrete tax item from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of certain intangible property and $2.2 billion related to gains on strategic investments, net. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $1.9 billion, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable, net of $1.6 billion. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was negatively impacted by changes in billing frequency for new business due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.Investing ActivitiesThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisitions of Slack and Acumen, as well as other acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of approximately $14.9 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was impacted by net inflows of $574 million from marketable securities activity and $483 million from strategic investment activity.The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisition of Vlocity, net of cash acquired, of approximately $1.2 billion as well by net outflows of $2.0 billion from marketable securities activity. In addition, we paid approximately $150 million of cash consideration related to the purchase of the property located at 450 Mission Street (“450 Mission”) in San Francisco, California, which is reflected in capital expenditures.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $7.9 billion of net proceeds from our July 2021 issuance of Senior Notes and $1.3 billion from proceeds from equity plans, partially offset by payments related to the Slack Convertible Notes, net of associated capped call proceeds of $1.2 billion. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of $1.3 billion from proceeds from equity plans.DebtAs of January 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding, with maturities starting in April 2023 through July 2061, with a total carrying value of $10.4 billion. In addition, we had senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on our purchase of an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco (“50 Fremont”), due in 2023, with a total carrying value of $186 million. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2022. In December 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in December 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2022. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under 49Table of Contentsthe Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, financing the consideration for, fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition.We do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. As of January 31, 2022, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were approximately $4.0 billion, with payments of $0.8 billion due in the next 12 months and $3.2 billion due thereafter. As of January 31, 2022, we have additional operating leases that have not yet commenced totaling $1.1 billion. In addition to our leasing arrangements, we have other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, including those with infrastructure service providers. Our total commitments under these agreements are $5.8 billion, of which payments of $1.0 billion are due in the next 12 months and $4.8 billion are due thereafter. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. During fiscal 2022 and in future fiscal years, we have made, and expect to continue to make, additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. While we continue to make investments in our infrastructure including offices, information technology and data centers, as well as investments with infrastructure service providers, to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of our investments.Other Future ObligationsOur overall acquisition strategy may evolve to require integration and business operation changes that may result in incremental income tax costs. The timing and amount of a tax cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation. 50Table of ContentsEnvironmental, Social, GovernanceWe believe the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that values drive value, and that effectively managing our priority Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) topics will help create long-term value for our investors. We also believe that transparently disclosing the goals and relevant metrics related to our ESG programs will allow our stakeholders to be informed about our progress.The topics covered in this section are informed by an internal ESG prioritization assessment refreshed in fiscal 2022, which assesses topics based on their potential impact to both our own enterprise value creation and the environment and society more broadly. The assessment gathered input from a number of our key internal and external stakeholders, such as investors, customers, suppliers, our employees and executives, non-governmental organizations and sector organizations. Our ESG disclosures are also informed by relevant topics identified through third-party ESG reporting organizations, frameworks and standards, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Standards, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). More information on our key ESG programs, goals and commitments, and key metrics can be found in our annual Stakeholder Impact Report, https://salesforce.com/stakeholder-impact-report.Website references throughout this document are provided for convenience only, and the content on the referenced websites is not incorporated by reference into this report. Our ESG highlights as of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 include the following:Climate and Sustainability. We continue to support science-based climate policies and decarbonization actions intended to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We released our Climate Action Plan at https://salesforce.com/sustainability, announced we have achieved net zero residual emissions across our full value chain and that we have achieved our longstanding goal of procuring electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 100 percent of the energy used globally. We also released our inaugural TCFD report, which can be found at https://investor.salesforce.com/tcfdreport.Equality. We invest in programs designed to enhance employee success and create a safe, healthy and engaging working environment that fosters our core value of equality for all. Refer to our “Human Capital Management” Section in Item 1 of Part I for details.ESG and Executive Compensation. To align and accelerate our ESG initiatives, beginning in fiscal 2023 all executive vice presidents, presidents and Section 16 officers will have a component of their incentive compensation plans tied to employee diversity and environmental measures.Sustainability Bond. We released our inaugural Sustainable Bond Framework (the “Framework"") which can be found at https://investor.salesforce.com/sustainablebondframework. In July 2021, we issued $1.0 billion of 2028 Senior Sustainability Notes, which will be allocated based on certain criteria described in the Framework. We will report on our allocations on an annual basis. While we believe that our ESG goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities, they are aspirational and may change, and there is no guarantee or promise that they will be met.51Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment risks. This exposure has increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of COVID-19 as discussed in more detail below.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change, including market impacts associated with COVID-19. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. The amount of revenue that was reported in USD for foreign subsidiaries that transact in international currencies during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 benefited by approximately one percent compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. In addition, fluctuations in USD against international currencies negatively impacted our remaining performance obligation by approximately two percent as of January 31, 2022 compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2021 using constant currency rates. Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $10.5 billion as of January 31, 2022. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses. Our fixed-income portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2022 could result in a $58 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive loss, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.52Table of ContentsAt January 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.0 billion. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $63 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. DebtWe maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): InstrumentMaturity DatePrincipal Outstanding as of January 31, 2022Interest TermsContractual Interest Rate2023 Senior NotesApril 2023$1,000 Fixed3.25%Loan assumed on 50 FremontJune 2023186 Fixed3.75%2024 Senior NotesJuly 20241,000 Fixed0.625%Credit FacilityDecember 20250 FloatingN/A2028 Senior NotesApril 20281,500 Fixed3.70%2028 Senior Sustainability NotesJuly 20281,000 Fixed1.50%2031 Senior NotesJuly 20311,500 Fixed1.95%2041 Senior NotesJuly 20411,250 Fixed2.70%2051 Senior NotesJuly 20512,000 Fixed2.90%2061 Senior NotesJuly 20611,250 Fixed3.05%The borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.125% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.125%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. Our Credit Facility allows for the LIBOR rate to be phased out and replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and therefore we do not anticipate a material impact by the expected upcoming LIBOR transition. We are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts. As of January 31, 2022, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility.The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.Strategic InvestmentsAs of January 31, 2022, our strategic investment portfolio consisted of investments in nearly 400 companies with a combined carrying value of $4.8 billion, including two privately held investments with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of the total strategic investments portfolio and represented 21 percent of the portfolio in aggregate. The following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of January 31, 2022 and excludes exited investments (in millions):Investment Type Capital Invested Unrealized Gains (Cumulative) Unrealized Losses (Cumulative)Carrying Value as of January 31, 2022Publicly held equity securities $258 $138 $(96)$300 Privately held equity securities 3,117 1,474 (195)4,396 Total equity securities$3,375 $1,612 $(291)$4,696 We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our strategic investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio. Volatility in the global market conditions, including recent economic disruptions, inflation and ongoing volatility in the public equity markets, may impact our strategic investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations.Our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and 53Table of Contentspreferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in the enterprise values of our largest privately held equity securities, representing 41 percent of our total strategic investments as of January 31, 2022 could result in a $165 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment.We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering.In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.54Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:33.332603

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and management objectives and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason.The following section generally discusses fiscal 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and 2022, as well as certain fiscal 2021 items. Discussions of fiscal 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.OverviewSalesforce, Inc. is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that brings companies and customers together in the digital age. Founded in 1999, we enable companies of every size and industry to take advantage of 38Table of Contentspowerful technologies to connect to their customers in a whole new way and help them transform their businesses around the customer in this digital-first world.Our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. With Slack, we provide a digital headquarters where companies, employees, governments and stakeholders can create success from anywhere.We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costsupfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average.In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of our workforce by approximately 10 percent and select real estate exits and office space reductions within certain markets. We expect to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. We plan to continue to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. Highlights from the Fiscal Year 2023•Revenue: For fiscal 2023, revenue was $31.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent year-over-year. •Earnings per Share: For fiscal 2023, diluted earnings per share was $0.21 as compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.48 from a year ago. •Cash: Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2023 was $7.1 billion, an increase of 19 percent year-over-year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2023 was $12.5 billion. •Remaining Performance Obligation: Total remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2023 was approximately $48.6 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2023 was approximately $24.6 billion, an increase of 12 percent year-over-year. •Share Repurchase Program: In August 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 28 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.0 billion. As of January 31, 2023, we were authorized to purchase a remaining $6.0 billion of our common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program, for an aggregate total authorized of $20.0 billion. •Restructuring: In January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of our workforce and select real estate exits and office space reductions within certain markets. For fiscal 2023, we incurred approximately $828 million related to the Plan.While we continue to see growth in our total revenues, macroeconomic factors have impacted our business and our customers’ businesses in ways that are difficult to isolate and quantify. Beginning in July 2022, we saw more measured buying behavior from our customers resulting in stretched sales cycles, additional approval layers required from our customers and deal compression. These trends continued in the second half of fiscal 2023. Slower growth in new and renewal business, particularly if sustained, impacts our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.In addition, the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted revenues by approximately four percent in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 and negatively impacted our current remaining performance obligation by approximately one percent as of January 31, 2023 compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2022 using constant currency rates. During fiscal 2023, the United States Dollar has strengthened significantly against certain foreign currencies in the markets in which we operate, particularly against the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. Based on the continued volatility in foreign currency markets, we expect lower revenue growth in the near-term compared to past results. If these conditions continue throughout fiscal 2024, they could have a material adverse impact on our near-term results and our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations could also be compounded by the 39Table of Contentsseasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.Fiscal YearOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.Operating SegmentsWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion about our segments. Sources of RevenuesWe derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2023. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, ""Cloud Services""), software license revenues from the sales of term and perpetual licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term and perpetual software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2023.The revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in “Results of Operations,” fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer’s business requirements and usage.Our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. As of January 31, 2023, our attrition rate, excluding MuleSoft, Tableau and Slack, was below 7.5 percent. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Mulesoft and Tableau will be included in our attrition rate calculation, which we expect to slightly increase our attrition rate going forward. We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash FlowUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating 40Table of Contentscash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.Cost of Revenues and Operating ExpensesCost of RevenuesCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, specific to customer experience and technical operations.Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based compensation expense, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead. Marketing and Sales Marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. As such, the timing of expense recognition for these commissions is not consistent with the timing of the associated cash payment. Our marketing and sales expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, professional services fees and allocated overhead. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, these types of expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category.41Table of ContentsRestructuringRestructuring, related to the January 2023 Plan, consist primarily of charges related to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and share-based compensation as well as exit charges associated with office space reductions. The actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of our fiscal 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements. The actions associated with the real estate restructuring under the Plan are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. Restructuring excludes allocated overhead.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.Revenue Recognition - Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations. We enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple Cloud Services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. Determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.Cloud Services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have generally concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (""SSP"") basis. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine the estimated standalone selling price using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.In certain cases, we are able to establish SSP based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We use a single amount to estimate SSP when it has observable prices. If SSP is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;•discount rates;•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed; •fair value of assumed equity awards; and42Table of Contents•fair value of pre-existing relationships.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income Taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.Strategic Investments. Accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value for these investments, we utilize the most recent data available and apply valuation methods, including the market approach and option pricing models (“OPM”), adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the classes of securities we hold. Such information available to us from investee companies is supplemented with estimates such as volatility and expected time to liquidity.We assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. Depending on our contractual rights as an investor, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.The particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in the enterprise values of our largest privately held equity securities, representing 37 percent of our total strategic investments as of January 31, 2023, could result in a $115 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio.Results of Operations43Table of ContentsThe following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023% of Total Revenues2022% of Total Revenues2021% of Total RevenuesRevenues:Subscription and support$29,021 93 %$24,657 93 %$19,976 94 %Professional services and other2,331 7 1,835 7 1,276 6 Total revenues31,352 100 26,492 100 21,252 100 Cost of revenues (1)(2):Subscription and support 5,821 19 5,059 19 4,154 20 Professional services and other 2,539 8 1,967 8 1,284 6 Total cost of revenues8,360 27 7,026 27 5,438 26 Gross profit22,992 73 19,466 73 15,814 74 Operating expenses (1)(2):Research and development5,055 16 4,465 17 3,598 17 Marketing and sales13,526 43 11,855 44 9,674 45 General and administrative2,553 8 2,598 10 2,087 10 Restructuring 828 3 0 0 0 0 Total operating expenses21,962 70 18,918 71 15,359 72 Income from operations1,030 3 548 2 455 2 Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net (239)(1)1,211 5 2,170 10 Other expense(131)0 (227)(1)(64)0 Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes660 2 1,532 6 2,561 12 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes(452)(1)(88)(1)1,511 7 Net income$208 1 %$1,444 5 %$4,072 19 %(1) Amounts related to amortization of intangible assets acquired through business combinations, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023% of Total Revenues2022% of Total Revenues2021% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$1,035 3 %$897 3 %$662 3 %Marketing and sales916 3 727 3 459 2 (2) Amounts related to stock-based compensation expense, as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023% of Total Revenues2022% of Total Revenues2021% of Total RevenuesCost of revenues$499 2 %$386 1 %$241 1 %Research and development1,136 3 918 4 703 4 Marketing and sales1,256 4 1,104 4 941 4 General and administrative368 1 371 1 305 1 Restructuring 20 0 0 0 0 0 44Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth selected balance sheet data and other metrics for each of the periods indicated (in millions, except remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions): As of January 31, 2023January 31, 2022Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$12,508 $10,537 Unearned revenue17,376 15,628 Remaining performance obligation48.6 43.7 Principal due on our outstanding debt obligations (1)10,682 10,686 (1) Amounts do not include operating or financing lease obligations.Remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022 was impacted by our recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of Slack Technologies, Inc. (“Slack”) in July 2021, our largest acquisition to date, such that approximately six months of Slack revenues and expenses are included in fiscal 2022 whereas 12 months of Slack operations are included in fiscal 2023. In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the one-year period subsequent to the acquisition date for the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful. Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023 and 2022Revenues Fiscal Year Ended January 31,Variance(in millions)20232022DollarsPercentSubscription and support$29,021 $24,657 $4,364 18 %Professional services and other2,331 1,835 496 27 Total revenues$31,352 $26,492 $4,860 18 %The increase in subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2023 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. Pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for either period. Revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately six percent and seven percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2023 and 2022.For business combinations prior to fiscal 2023, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. In fiscal 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2021-08”) which requires contract liabilities (i.e., unearned revenue) acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, thereby eliminating the previously unrecognized would-be revenue. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not materially impact our results of operations in fiscal 2023.The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.45Table of ContentsSubscription and Support Revenues by Service OfferingSubscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2023As a % of Total Subscription and Support Revenues2022As a % of Total Subscription and Support RevenuesGrowth RateSales $6,831 24 %$5,989 24 %14 %Service7,369 25 6,474 26 14 Platform and Other5,967 20 4,509 19 32 Marketing and Commerce 4,516 16 3,902 16 16 Data4,338 15 3,783 15 15 Total$29,021 100 %$24,657 100 %18 %Our Industry Offerings revenue is included in one of the above service offerings depending on the primary service purchased. Slack revenues are included in Platform and Other. Data is comprised of revenue from Analytics and Integration service offerings.Data subscription and support revenues include revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Therefore, we expect Data to experience greater volatility in revenues period to period compared to our other service offerings. Additionally, as we transition customers within the Data offering from perpetual and term software licenses to subscription based services, revenue associated with such customers will generally be recognized ratably over the contract term, resulting in potentially less revenue in the period the customer transitions but potentially increasing revenues over the remaining term.Revenues by Geography Fiscal Year Ended January 31,(in millions)2023As a % of Total Revenues2022As a % of Total RevenuesGrowth RateAmericas$21,250 68 %$17,983 68 %18 %Europe7,163 23 6,016 23 19 Asia Pacific2,939 9 2,493 9 18 Total$31,352 100 %$26,492 100 %18 %Revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the Salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. The increase in revenues across all regions was due primarily to the continued execution of our business and growth strategy, including increasing our geographic reach primarily through extending our go-to-market capabilities globally. During fiscal 2023, revenues outside of the Americas were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations by approximately ten percent compared to fiscal 2022.Cost of Revenues Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)2023As a % of Total Revenues2022As a % of Total RevenuesSubscription and support$5,821 19 %$5,059 19 %$762 Professional services and other2,539 8 %1,967 8 %572 Total cost of revenues$8,360 27 %$7,026 27 %$1,334 For fiscal 2023, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $638 million in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. We have increased our headcount associated with our data centers, customer support and professional services by 27 percent since fiscal 2022 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers as well as from our fiscal 2023 acquisition of Traction on Demand. Fiscal 2023 cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues, were consistent to that of fiscal 2022.We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. We also plan to add employees in our 46Table of Contentsprofessional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses is expected to affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the near term.Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)2023As a % of Total Revenues2022As a % of Total RevenuesResearch and development$5,055 16 %$4,465 17 %$590 Marketing and sales13,526 43 11,855 44 1,671 General and administrative2,553 8 2,598 10 (45)Restructuring 828 3 0 0 828 Total operating expenses$21,962 70 %$18,918 71 %$3,044 For fiscal 2023, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $547 million in employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development headcount increased by three percent since fiscal 2022 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies. Fiscal 2023 research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to our hiring pause that began in the second half of fiscal 2023 as well as our January 2023 restructuring plan.We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we continue to invest in technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.For fiscal 2023, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 billion in employee-related costs, including the amortization of deferred commissions and stock-based compensation expense. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by three percent since fiscal 2022 primarily due to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Fiscal 2023 marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to our hiring pause that began in the second half of fiscal 2023, our January 2023 restructuring plan and decreased marketing expenses.We expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may decrease as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we focus on leveraging our self-serve and partner-led channels and increasing our sales productivity.For fiscal 2023, the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to decreased third-party and miscellaneous expenses. Our general and administrative headcount increased by five percent since fiscal 2022 as we added personnel to support our growth. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased primarily due to our hiring pause in the second half of fiscal 2023, our January 2023 restructuring plan and real estate exits that occurred in fiscal 2023.We expect that general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars and may decrease as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we continue to invest in process efficiency initiatives.In fiscal 2023, approximately $828 million of costs were incurred related to the January 2023 restructuring plan, of which approximately $683 million relates to employee transition, severance payments, employee benefits and stock-based compensation expense and $145 million relates to exit charges associated with office space reductions. We expect to incur approximately $600 million to $1.1 billion in charges in connection with the Plan in the near term.47Table of ContentsOther Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended January 31,VarianceDollars(in millions)20232022Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net$(239)$1,211 $(1,450)Other expense(131)(227)96 Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments including impairments. Our strategic investment portfolio continues to be affected by high public equity market volatility as well as challenging market conditions for companies in which we hold private equity or debt investments. In fiscal 2023 these factors resulted in impairments on privately held equity and debt securities of $491 million, partially offset by $180 million in unrealized gains on privately held equity securities.Other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our finance leases, offset by interest income on our marketable securities portfolio. Other expense decreased primarily due to an increase in investment income from rising interest rates offset by an increase in interest expense primarily driven by our issuance of $8.0 billion Senior Notes in July 2021.

The majority of the tax provision was related to taxes from profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States which includes withholding taxes. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in our domestic and foreign earnings, or material discrete tax items, or a combination of these factors resulting from transactions or events, for example, acquisitions, changes to our operating structure and other macroeconomic factors.In fiscal 2022, we recognized a tax provision of $88 million on a pretax income of $1.5 billion. Our tax provision was primarily due to taxes from profitable jurisdictions outside of the United States, which was offset by a net US tax benefit primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock based compensation.The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced new provisions,including a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of$1 billion adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The corporate minimum tax will beeffective for fiscal 2024. While we do not anticipate this change to be significant, it could impact our consolidated financial position. We continue to monitor and analyze new information, interpretations and guidance. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2022 and 2021For a discussion of the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2022.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.5 billion and accounts receivable of $10.8 billion. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. Our credit agreement (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”), which as of January 31, 2023 provides the ability to borrow up to $3.0 billion in unsecured financing (the “Credit Facility”), also serves as a source of liquidity. Cash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next 12 months. 48Table of ContentsIn the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. To facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.Cash FlowsFor fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 our cash flows were as follows (in millions):4Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 202320222021Net cash provided by operating activities$7,111 $6,000 $4,801 Net cash used in investing activities(1,989)(14,536)(3,971)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(3,562)7,838 1,194 Operating ActivitiesThe net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 was related to net income of $208 million, adjusted for non-cash items including $3.8 billion of depreciation and amortization and $3.3 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. Cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 was further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $1.7 billion, partially offset by the change in costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, net of $2.3 billion and accounts receivable, net of $1.0 billion due to cash collections. Cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the provision from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which became effective in fiscal 2023 and requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development costs. The change increased our cash taxes paid in fiscal 2023. As our business continues to grow and our expenses remain in line with or less than our revenue growth, we expect to continue to see growth in net cash provided by operating activities.The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily related to net income of $1.4 billion, adjusted for non-cash items including $3.3 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 billion related to stock-based expense offset by $1.2 billion related to gains on strategic investments. Cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 was further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $2.6 billion, partially offset by accounts receivable, net of $1.8 billion.Investing ActivitiesThe net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily related to capital expenditures of $798 million, net outflows of $557 million from marketable securities activity, cash consideration for acquisitions of approximately $439 million and net outflows of $195 million from strategic investment activity.The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisitions of Slack and Acumen, as well as other acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of approximately $14.9 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was impacted by net inflows of $574 million from marketable securities activity and $483 million from strategic investment activity.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of $4.0 billion from repurchases of common stock partially offset by $861 million from proceeds from equity plans.Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $7.9 billion of net proceeds from our July 2021 issuance of Senior Notes and $1.3 billion from proceeds from equity plans, partially offset by payments related to the Slack Convertible Notes, net of associated capped call proceeds of $1.2 billion.DebtAs of January 31, 2023, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding, with maturities starting in April 2023 through July 2061. The total carrying value of this debt was $10.6 billion, of which $1.0 billion is related to the 2023 Senior Notes due in the next 12 months. In addition, we had senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on our purchase of an office building located at 50 Fremont Street in San Francisco (“50 Fremont”), due in June 2023, with a total carrying value of $182 million. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of January 31, 2023. In December 2020, we entered into the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving Credit Facility that matures in December 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2023. We may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, 49Table of Contentswhich may include, without limitation, financing the consideration for, fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition. In April 2022, we amended the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement to reflect certain immaterial administrative changes.We do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.Share Repurchase ProgramIn August 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 28 million shares of our common stock for approximately $4.0 billion at an average cost of $144.94. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of January 31, 2023, we were authorized to purchase a remaining $6.0 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. In February 2023, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion in repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program, for an aggregate total authorized of $20.0 billion. Subsequent to January 31, 2023, we have paid approximately $0.3 billion through March 6, 2023 for additional shares under the Share Repurchase Program.The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. It introduced a new 1 percent excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. It did not impact our financing cash flows in fiscal 2023. The excise tax may apply to future repurchases and could impact our financing cash flows.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. As of January 31, 2023, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were approximately $4.7 billion, with payments of $933 million due in the next 12 months and $3.8 billion due thereafter. As of January 31, 2023, we have additional operating leases that have not yet commenced totaling $0.4 billion. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. In addition to our leasing arrangements, we have other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, including those with infrastructure service providers. Our total commitments under these agreements are $6.5 billion, of which payments of $1.1 billion are due in the next 12 months and $5.4 billion are due thereafter. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities.During fiscal 2023 and in future fiscal years, we have made, and expect to continue to make, additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations to increase productivity and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. While we continue to make investments in our infrastructure including offices, information technology and data centers, as well as investments with infrastructure service providers, to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of our investments.Other Future ObligationsOur overall acquisition strategy may evolve to require integration and business operation changes that may result in incremental income tax costs. The timing and amount of a tax cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation. Additionally, as we utilize our remaining tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards, we expect an increase in future cash taxes. The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced new provisions, including a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $1 billion adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The corporate minimum tax will be effective in fiscal 2024. While we do not anticipate this change to be significant, it could impact our consolidated financial position. We continue to monitor and analyze new information, interpretation and guidance.Additionally, related to the restructuring plan announced in January 2023, we expect approximately $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion in future cash expenditures, primarily related to workforce costs such as severance payments.50Table of ContentsEnvironmental, Social, GovernanceWe believe the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that values drive value, and that effectively managing our priority Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics will help create long-term value for our investors.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity investment risks. This exposure has increased due to recent financial market movements and changes to our expectations of near-term possible movements caused by the impact of the macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 as discussed in more detail below.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe primarily conduct our business in the following locations: the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Japan. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, costs associated with third-party infrastructure providers, additional headcount in foreign countries, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in the following currencies: the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Brazilian Real against the United States Dollar (“USD”). These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change, including market impacts associated with COVID-19. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Foreign Currency Transaction RiskOur foreign currency exposures typically arise from selling annual and multi-year subscriptions in multiple currencies, customer accounts receivable, intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and other intercompany transactions. Our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on selected assets or liabilities without exposing us to additional risk associated with transactions that could be regarded as speculative. We pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we currently designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Accordingly, we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Given the short duration of the forward contracts, the amount recorded is not significant. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Foreign Currency Translation RiskFluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, revenues, operating expenses and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into USD. Total revenue during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, was negatively impacted by approximately four percent compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. In addition, fluctuations in USD against international currencies negatively impacted our current remaining performance obligation by approximately one percent as of January 31, 2023 compared to what we would have reported as of January 31, 2022 using constant currency rates.Interest Rate SensitivityWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.5 billion as of January 31, 2023. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses. Our fixed-income portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2023 could result in a $56 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations 52Table of Contentsin the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive loss, net, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities.At January 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $10.5 billion. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $58 million.Market Risk and Market Interest RiskWe deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions. DebtWe maintain debt obligations that are subject to market interest risk, as follows (in millions): InstrumentMaturity DatePrincipal Outstanding as of January 31, 2023Interest TermsContractual Interest Rate2023 Senior NotesApril 2023$1,000 Fixed3.25%Loan assumed on 50 FremontJune 2023182 Fixed3.752024 Senior NotesJuly 20241,000 Fixed0.625Credit FacilityDecember 20250 FloatingN/A2028 Senior NotesApril 20281,500 Fixed3.702028 Senior Sustainability NotesJuly 20281,000 Fixed1.502031 Senior NotesJuly 20311,500 Fixed1.952041 Senior NotesJuly 20411,250 Fixed2.702051 Senior NotesJuly 20512,000 Fixed2.902061 Senior NotesJuly 20611,250 Fixed3.05The borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.125% or an adjusted benchmark rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.125%, in each case with such spread being determined based on our credit rating. We are also obligated to pay an ongoing commitment fee on undrawn amounts. As of January 31, 2023, there was no outstanding borrowing amount under the Credit Facility.The bank counterparties to our derivative contracts potentially expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet the minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our ongoing assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.Strategic InvestmentsAs of January 31, 2023, our strategic investment portfolio consisted of investments in over 400 companies with a combined carrying value of $4.7 billion, including two privately held investments with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of the total strategic investments portfolio and represented sixteen percent of the portfolio in aggregate. The following table sets forth additional information regarding active equity investments within our strategic investment portfolio as of January 31, 2023 and excludes exited investments (in millions):Investment Type Capital Invested Unrealized Gains (Cumulative) Unrealized Losses (Cumulative)Carrying Value as of January 31, 2023Publicly held equity securities $2 $2 $(1)$3 Privately held equity securities 3,611 1,310 (321)4,600 Total equity securities$3,613 $1,312 $(322)$4,603 We anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our strategic investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio. Volatility in the global market conditions, including recent economic disruptions, inflation and ongoing volatility in the public equity markets, may impact our strategic investment portfolio and our financial results may fluctuate from historical results and expectations.Our investments in privately held securities are in various classes of equity which may have different rights and 53Table of Contentspreferences. The particular securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent in the enterprise values of our largest privately held equity securities, representing 37 percent of our total strategic investments as of January 31, 2023, could result in a $115 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our privately held equity investments are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for a same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment.We continually evaluate our investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering.In addition, the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. All of our investments, particularly those in privately held companies, are therefore subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital.54Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:31.111990

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding revenues, expenses and results of operations. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors Which May Impact Future Operating Results.” We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors. Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to a March 2004 report by Forrester Research, Inc. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on-demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions. We define paying subscriptions as unique user accounts, purchased by customers for use by their employees and other customer-authorized users that have not been suspended for non-payment and for which we are recognizing subscription revenue. The number of our paying subscribers increased from approximately 30,000 as of February 1, 2001 to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. We plan to re-invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by hiring additional personnel, particularly in marketing and sales; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; obtaining additional business continuity services, additional data center capacity and a separate development and test data center; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 55 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2005 and 57 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2005, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2005. 20 Table of Contents Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on-demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for 90 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2005 and 89 percent during fiscal 2004. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges, employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on-demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing consulting services. To the extent that our customer base grows, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. Additionally, we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services and additional data center capacity. We currently expect these resources to be in place at various dates during fiscal 2006. We currently expect the annual cost of these services to be approximately $7.0 million. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead. We have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on-demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to 21 Table of Contents have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We are also in the process of obtaining a development and test data center, which we currently expect will be in place by July 2005. We expect the annual cost of this data center to be approximately $4.0 million. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. As our revenues increase, we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive, finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non-employees, option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services. These charges have been significant and are reflected in the historical financial results. Excluding the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options, we expect stock-based expenses to be between $3.0 to $4.0 million in fiscal 2006. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2005, we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the venture’s financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results. Through January 31, 2005, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 22 Table of Contents We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.” On August 1, 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is probable; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, consulting revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct and incremental costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $874,000 at January 31, 2005 and $32,000 at January 31, 2004. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2005, we deferred $14.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $15.6 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2004, we deferred $16.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $8.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled and $9.6 million at January 31, 2005 and $11.2 million at January 31, 2004. 23 Table of Contents We assess the commission plans for our sales representatives annually. The impact of any changes to the commission plans will have an effect on the growth of the deferred commission asset balance. During fiscal 2005, we paid our sales representatives upfront commissions for the first two years of the noncancelable subscription contracts. In previous years, we paid upfront commissions on the entire value of the noncancelable subscription contracts, which had terms ranging up to 5 years. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We recorded deferred stock-based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, our operating and financial performance, private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties, issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm. Following our initial public offering, the fair value of our common stock is determined by the trading price of such stock on the New York Stock Exchange. We amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the four-year vesting period of the underlying option awards. As of January 31, 2005, we had an aggregate of $5.9 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized. We currently expect this deferred stock-based compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $3.0 million during fiscal 2006; $2.0 million during fiscal 2007; $0.8 million during fiscal 2008 and $100,000 during fiscal 2009. We have elected not to record stock-based compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Beginning on August 1, 2005, which is the start of our third quarter in fiscal 2006, we will begin to prospectively recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R (see Recent Accounting Pronouncement below for further discussion). We are currently assessing the impact this prospective change in accounting will have, but believe that it will have a material and adverse impact on our reported results of operations. In the past, we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non-employees. For these options and warrants, we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. As of January 31, 2005, we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to non-employees except for options for 50,000 shares of our common stock, which will fully vest by July 2007 and have an exercise price of $2.50 per share. At January 31, 2005, one of the assumptions in the Black-Scholes computation is an expected stock price volatility of 75 percent. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Historically, we have recorded a full valuation allowance to fully reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of being able to realize these benefits. If our positive trend of earnings continues, it is likely that the valuation allowance will be reversed at some point in the future. However, we cannot predict which quarter this will occur. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

The total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004. Our gross profit during fiscal 2005 was $142.9 million, or 81 percent of revenues, and operating income was $6.5 million. Operating income for the period included a non-cash stock-based expense of $3.6 million. During fiscal 2004, we generated a gross profit of $78.8 million, or 82 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $3.7 million, substantially all of which resulted from the reduction in accruals related to the release of future obligations associated with a portion of the office space that we abandoned in December 2001. Operating income during fiscal 2004 also included $4.4 million of non-cash stock-based expense. During fiscal 2005, we continued to incur substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business. We added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, and developers to broaden and enhance our on-demand service. In June 2004, we completed our initial public offering and sold 11,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $11.00 per share through which we raised a total of $126.5 million in gross proceeds. After deducting the underwriting discount of $8.8 million and offering expenses of $3.9 million, net proceeds were $113.8 million. During fiscal 2005, we generated $55.9 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $21.8 million during fiscal 2004. At January 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $205.9 million, as compared to $35.8 million at January 31, 2004, accounts receivable of $48.9 million, as compared to $26.5 million at January 31, 2004, and deferred revenue of $95.9 million, as compared to $49.7 million at January 31, 2004. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues. Total revenues were $176.4 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $96.0 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of $80.4 million, or 84 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying 27 Table of Contents subscribers to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004. Professional services and other revenues were $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $18.4 million, or 108 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $16.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily comprised of an increase of $12.1 million in employee-related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 80 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 million in service delivery costs and an increase of $1.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2005 by $2.3 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded. The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. In any particular quarterly period during fiscal 2006, our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may slightly exceed 20 percent. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $2.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $2.3 million and an increase of $0.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since January 31, 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $41.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $34.3 million in employee-related costs, $3.5 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings and event costs and $3.4 million in allocated overhead. Of the $34.3 million increase in employee-related costs, $7.0 million was related to the increased amortization expense of deferred commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 76 percent since January 31, 2004 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.4 million. The increase was due to an increase of $8.3 million in employee-related costs and $5.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 64 percent since January 31, 2004 as we added personnel to support our growth. The increase in professional and outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the United States. 28 Table of Contents Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $3.4 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlord’s lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our landlord that would release us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in our headquarters building in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building. The agreement is contingent upon the occurrence of certain conditions that will affect the final determination of the lease abandonment accrual on our consolidated balance sheet. If these certain conditions occur, we believe there will be an immaterial reduction in the accrual, which will be reflected as lease recovery during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Because of the March 2005 agreement described above, we are currently evaluating the possibility of consolidating more of our operations in the headquarters building. If we did this, we would abandon approximately 20,000 square feet of office space located elsewhere in San Francisco, which is under a long-term operating lease commitment. Such an abandonment would result in a charge against our operating results in the quarter in which the event would occur. Operating Income. Operating income during fiscal 2005 was $6.5 million. During fiscal 2004, it was $3.7 million, substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above. The increase in operating income year over year was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Income (losses) from operations outside of the Americas was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and $(1.1) million during fiscal 2004. The continued investment outside of the Americas was due to our efforts in expanding the number of locations where we conduct business and expanding our international selling and marketing activities. Interest Income. Interest income substantially consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and also includes interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and was $379,000 during fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income tax expense of $1.2 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to a provision for income tax expense of $541,000 for fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes consists of amounts accrued for our domestic federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax liability as well as our foreign income tax expense. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 and 2004 was 13 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to domestic loss carryovers net of foreign losses with no benefit. As of January 31, 2005, our deferred tax asset balance was $28.2 million and was fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. To realize the deferred tax assets, pretax income must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized. Historic profits have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date. Further, ongoing stock option exercise activity may, as in fiscal 2005, increase the total deferred tax asset balance. Accordingly, management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets and therefore we have fully offset net deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance. Based on our estimates for fiscal 2006 and beyond, we believe the uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where deferred tax assets may be realized. If we were to 29 Table of Contents determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our income or reduce our loss and increase stockholders’ equity in the quarter when such determination is made. The change in the valuation allowance of $8.5 million is primarily due to the uncertainties of realizing certain domestic losses, net operating losses incurred by the Japanese joint venture and certain tax credit carryforwards. The balance in the valuation allowance at the end of fiscal 2005 includes approximately $8.1 million for stock plan deductions, which will be credited to additional capital and the provision for income taxes if realized. We currently believe that our fiscal 2006 effective tax rate will be approximately 25 percent, exclusive of the impact of expensing stock options beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of full-year income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. The estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items. These actual results could vary from those projected. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues. Total revenues were $96.0 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $51.0 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of $45.0 million, or 88 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004, compared to $47.7 million, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2003. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004 from approximately 76,000 as of January 31, 2003. Professional services and other revenues were $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004, compared to $3.3 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2003. The increase in professional service and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increasing number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $7.1 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $10.0 million, or 141 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and the expansion of our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $10.4 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $6.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.4 million in employee-related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 53 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization, and an increase of $700,000 in service delivery costs. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the higher demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded. The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve new customers and paying subscribers. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $4.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $2.4 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in employee-related costs. Our research and development headcount increased by 57 percent from fiscal 2003 as we added personnel to upgrade and extend our service offerings. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $33.5 million, or 66 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $21.1 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $18.0 million in employee-related costs, $1.0 million in increased marketing event costs, $800,000 in payments to partners, and $700,000 in allocated 30 Table of Contents overhead. Of the $18.0 million in increased employee-related costs, $6.6 million was related to sales commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 42 percent from fiscal 2003 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $13.0 million, or 26 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $3.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.0 million in employee-related costs and an increase of $900,000 in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 29 percent from fiscal 2003 as we added personnel to support our growth. Lease Recovery. In December 2001, we abandoned excess office space in San Francisco, California and recorded a $7.7 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 pertaining to the estimated future net obligations under the non-cancelable lease. Since the space was not leased to a subtenant, there were no immediate cash savings from the abandonment. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlord’s lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $4.3 million credit to reflect the reversal of the remaining accrued liability that was directly associated with this space. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded an additional accrual of $900,000 related to the remaining 5,000 square feet of abandoned office space in San Francisco. This additional accrual resulted from a revision of our estimates of the timing and amount of projected subtenant income based on difficulties in subleasing the remaining space. Operating Income (Loss). Operating income during fiscal 2004 was $3.7 million and included the $3.4 million lease recovery described above. The operating loss during fiscal 2003 was $10.5 million. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $45.0 million increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Loss from operations outside of the Americas was $1.1 million during fiscal 2004 and was $3.8 million during fiscal 2003. The continued losses outside of the Americas were due to our efforts in expanding the number of locations where we conduct business and expanding our international selling and marketing activities. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. Interest income was $379,000 during fiscal 2004, compared to $471,000 during fiscal 2003, a decrease of $92,000. The decrease was primarily due to declining interest rates and the mix of marketable securities investments, substantially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes of $541,000 during fiscal 2004 represented federal alternative minimum taxes of approximately $200,000, and various state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of approximately $300,000. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 13 percent as compared to zero for fiscal 2003. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to domestic loss carryovers net of foreign losses with no benefit. Our deferred tax asset balance at January 31, 2004 was $19.7 million and was fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount due to uncertainties regarding realization of the deferred tax asset balance. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million, accounts receivable of $48.9 million and cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 of $55.9 million. In June 2004, we completed the sale of 11,500,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering, including the underwriters’ exercise of an over-allotment option, and realized net proceeds of $113.8 million. To date, we have not spent any of the proceeds from the initial public offering. 31 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $55.9 million during fiscal 2005, $21.8 million during fiscal 2004 and $5.2 million during fiscal 2003. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by or used in operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $149.2 million during fiscal 2005, $21.1 million during fiscal 2004 and $9.6 million during fiscal 2003. The increase in amounts used in fiscal 2005 primarily related to the investment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering, the investment of excess cash, the reduction in restricted cash balances and capital expenditures associated with computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure and work force. Net cash provided by financing activities was $118.9 million during fiscal 2005, $1.1 million during fiscal 2004 and $1.0 million during fiscal 2003. The $118.5 million of net proceeds from both the sale of common stock during the initial public offering and the exercise of employee stock options and the collection of $1.0 million in notes receivable from stockholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations and the repurchase of unvested shares of common stock from terminated employees. At January 31, 2005, our employees held 4.7 million vested stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $1.88 per share. If our employees exercise these awards, we will receive a significant amount of proceeds from the option exercises. During fiscal 2001, we established a $3.5 million letter of credit in favor of our principal office landlord. This amount was reduced in June 2004 to $2.8 million. This letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit, which is maintained at the granting financial institution, for the same amount. This certificate of deposit is included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As of January 31, 2005, the letter of credit was outstanding and, to date, no amounts have been drawn against it. The letter of credit renews annually through December 31, 2010. In addition, we had two additional letters of credit outstanding as of January 31, 2005, which are related to office space leases. These letters of credit are collateralized by certificates of deposit totaling $0.4 million at the granting financial institution, for the same amount and are included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. These letters of credit are due at various dates through December 2008. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2005, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long-term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 1,317 $ 585 $ 732 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Office space 38,691 8,367 13,232 10,731 6,361 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 6,442 3,642 2,800 — — Contractual commitments 2,390 1,572 818 — — Lease abandonment liabilities and other 1,874 278 466 486 644 32 Table of Contents Our office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. In February 2005, we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of $8.8 million. Additionally, we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services, additional data center capacity and a development and test data center. We expect these resources to be in place at various dates during fiscal 2006. While the costs for these will be significant, we believe that most of the capital expenditures for the additional business continuity services, additional data center capacity and development and test data center will be leased so there will not be a significant impact on our liquidity during fiscal 2006. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R on August 1, 2005, which is the start of our third fiscal quarter next year. We are currently assessing the impact this prospective change in accounting will have but believe that it will have a material and adverse impact on our reported results of operations. Additionally, SFAS 123R requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. We currently classify these tax benefits, which totaled $798,000 in fiscal 2005, as a source of cash provided by operating activities. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We are an early-stage company in an emerging market with an unproven business model, a new and unproven enterprise technology model and a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. We have only a limited operating history and our current business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on-demand CRM application service in February 2000. The risks and difficulties we encounter as an early-stage company in the new and rapidly evolving market of on-demand CRM application services include the following: • our new and unproven business and technology models; • a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings; and • the difficulties we face in managing rapid growth in personnel and operations. We may not be able to successfully address any of these risks or others, including the other risks related to our business and industry described below. Failure to adequately do so could seriously harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. Defects in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of software both developed in-house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party Web hosting facility could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We provide our service through computer hardware that is currently located in a third-party Web hosting facility in Sunnyvale, California operated by Qwest Communications International Inc. We do not control the operation of this facility, and it is subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. It is also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at the facility, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at the facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, the failure by the Qwest facility to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. We have an agreement with SunGard Data Systems, a provider of availability services, to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us access to hardware, software and Internet connectivity in the event the Qwest facility becomes unavailable. Even with this disaster recovery arrangement, however, our service would be interrupted during the transition. We are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services and additional data center capacity, however, none of the services or capacity is currently operational. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service 34 Table of Contents may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates. Our business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. If we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations, our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice. Due to our limited operating history, our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. For example, in the last ten fiscal quarters, we have recorded quarterly operating income of as much as $4.3 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as $4.9 million. We base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth. Our expenses and investments are, to a large extent, fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations. As a result, we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers’ requirements; • the renewal rates for our service; • changes in our pricing policies; • the introduction of new features to our service; • the rate of expansion and effectiveness of our sales force; • the length of the sales cycle for our service; • new product and service introductions by our competitors; • our success in selling our service to large enterprises; • variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; • technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; • general economic conditions in our geographic markets; • the timing of additional investments in our on-demand application service and in our consulting service; • regulatory compliance costs; • payment defaults by customers; and • extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments. Some of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. 35 Table of Contents We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future. We incurred significant losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in February 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we generated small profits in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. As we are a young company in an emerging market, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may incur additional significant operating losses in the future. In addition, we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. If our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased expenses, we will not continue to be profitable. You should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline. Furthermore, if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers’ data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. If our on-demand application service is not widely accepted, our operating results will be harmed. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our on-demand application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future success. Factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include: • reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an on-demand application service; • the price and performance of our service; • the level of customization we can offer; • the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; • reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and 36 Table of Contents • adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability or security of on-demand application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and adverse statements made by competitors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. The inability of our on-demand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business. The market for our technology delivery model and on-demand application services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be harmed. The market for on-demand application services is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on-demand application services in general, and for CRM in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to on-demand application services. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on-demand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on-demand application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, as a new company in this unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. We do not have an adequate history with our subscription model to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact, some customers have elected not to do so. In addition, our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. If these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. Our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and 37 Table of Contents management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses, which have a greater rate of attrition and non-renewal than medium-sized and large enterprise customers. Our small business customers, which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees, typically have shorter initial subscription periods and, based on our limited experience to date, have had a higher rate of attrition and non-renewal as compared to our medium-sized and large enterprise customers. If we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough, our revenue could decline. Our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large customers. Our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our service by medium-sized and large businesses. Our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful. In particular, because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history, these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical CRM applications from one of our larger, more established competitors. Even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers, they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service, which could harm our business. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers, all of which could harm our business. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customer’s decision to use our service may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our service. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical requirements have been met. In addition, larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for CRM applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, many of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed. Some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. 38 Table of Contents Our current principal competitors include: • enterprise software application vendors including Amdocs Limited, E.piphany, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, PeopleSoft, Inc., which has been acquired by Oracle, SAP AG and Siebel Systems, Inc.; • packaged CRM software vendors, some of whom offer hosted services, such as BMC Software Corporation, FrontRange Solutions, Inc., Onyx Software Corp., Pivotal Corporation, which has been acquired by CDC Software Corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, and Sage Group plc; • on-demand CRM application service providers such as Siebel Systems, NetSuite, Inc., RightNow Technologies, Inc., and Salesnet, Inc.; and • enterprise application service providers including British Telecom, IBM and Corio, Inc., which has been acquired by IBM. In addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own CRM applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and/or bundle CRM products with their products in the future. We also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged CRM software vendors, but who are developing directly competitive on-demand CRM application services offerings, such as Siebel Systems through Siebel CRM OnDemand. Our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including Accenture Ltd., BearingPoint, Inc. and IBM, as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in CRM implementations. We have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements. Many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. If we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services such as Supportforce and Customforce depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. 39 Table of Contents Any efforts we may make in the future to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed. To date, we have focused our business on providing on-demand application services for the CRM market, but we may in the future seek to expand into other markets. However, any efforts to expand beyond the CRM market may never result in significant revenue growth for us. In addition, efforts to expand our on-demand application service beyond the CRM market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business. If we fail to develop our brand cost-effectively, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business could suffer. Any failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth. We continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. Because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States. For example, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2005, 18 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2004 and 14 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: • localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; • laws and business practices favoring local competitors; • compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; • foreign currency fluctuations; • different pricing environments; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; 40 Table of Contents • longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and • regional economic and political conditions. Some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and paid in local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuation. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. We currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others. We rely on third-party hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. We rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. 41 Table of Contents We may be required to purchase the interest in our Japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner, under certain circumstances, on terms that may not be favorable to us. In some circumstances, we may be required to purchase the interest of our Japanese joint venture partner. If we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner, or if we and our partner disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues, then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture. In the event we are required to purchase our partner’s interest in the joint venture, we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital, which could harm our financial condition. Although the timing and circumstances of any such purchase, were it to be required, are not predictable, if the joint venture were valued based on its most recent financing, which occurred in September 2003, the buyout price could be as much as approximately $13.0 million. If we acquire any companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results. We may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. We have not made any acquisitions or investments to date, and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: • difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; • diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; • risk of entering new markets; • potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments; • potential loss of key employees; • inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; and • delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. Evolving regulation of the Internet may affect us adversely. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for CRM solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business. Privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed 42 Table of Contents by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers’ customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. For example, regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. The European Union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. All of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers’ ability to collect and/or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. The success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of the Internet as a business tool. Expansion in the sales of our service depends on the continued acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commerce platform for enterprises. The Internet could lose its viability as a business tool due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality-of-service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been harmed by “viruses,” “worms” and similar malicious programs, and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If for any reason the Internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform, the demand for our service would be significantly reduced, which would harm our business. Our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Stock Exchange and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. Our efforts to comply with these new regulations, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities. By the end of fiscal 2006, we are required to comply with the SOX requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors’ audit of that assessment. Although we believe our on-going review and testing of our internal controls will enable us to be compliant with the SOX requirements, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate by the end of fiscal 2006. If we cannot assess our internal controls over financial reporting as effective, or our external auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on such assessment, our stock price could decline. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in 43 Table of Contents continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Marc Benioff, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Steve Cakebread, our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Steele, our President of Worldwide Sales and Services, Pat Sueltz, our President of Global Operations, and Parker Harris, our Executive Vice President of Technology. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet-related services and senior sales executives. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. Furthermore, the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. We might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 44 Table of Contents We believe our reported financial results will be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in December 2004, the FASB announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options. We plan to adopt this new accounting pronouncement, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. We believe this change in accounting will materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock If our involvement in a lengthy May 9, 2004 New York Times article about salesforce.com or any other publicity regarding salesforce.com or the initial public offering during the waiting period were held to be “gun jumping” in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, we could be required to repurchase securities sold in our initial public offering. In a New York Times article dated May 9, 2004 and entitled “It’s Not Google. It’s That Other Big I.P.O.,” information regarding our initial public offering and salesforce.com, our development and our business strategy was published. In preparation of the article, the reporter spent most of a full day with Marc Benioff, our Chairman and CEO. As a result, it could have been expected that a lengthy article would be published. Portions of this New York Times article were subsequently reprinted by a number of news outlets. While some of the factual statements about salesforce.com in the article were disclosed in the Registration Statement for our initial public offering, the article presented statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in the Registration Statement. In addition to the New York Times article, there was substantial additional press coverage regarding us and the initial public offering during the offering process. These articles also presented statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in the Registration Statement. In order to reduce the risk of investors’ possible reliance on the New York Times article and other news reports and articles, we stopped our offering on May 13, 2004. We then allowed a “cooling off” period to pass so that the effect of this article and other reports, articles and information would be dissipated. It is uncertain whether the May 9th New York Times article or any of our publicity related activities could be held to be a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. If any article or activity was held by a court to be in violation of the Securities Act, we could be required to repurchase the shares sold to purchasers in our public offering at the original $11.00 purchase price, plus interest, for a period of one year following the date of the violation. We would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the Securities Act occurred. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Further, our common stock has a limited trading history. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include: • variations in our operating results; • announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; 45 Table of Contents • recruitment or departure of key personnel; • changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; and • market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation, such as the lawsuits following the approximate 25% decline in our stock price on July 21, 2004, which may harm our business and results of operations. If securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. Furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: • establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; • establish the size of the board of directors at seven (7) members; • provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; • require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; • authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt; • eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; 46 Table of Contents • prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; • provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and • establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. We have a risk management policy that allows us to utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows. If we were to enter into hedging contracts, the contracts by policy would have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy we would not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million at January 31, 2005. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in higher interest income of $0.8 million offset by a principal reduction of $1.6 million for a net reduction of $0.8 million over a 12-month period. Similarly, a 100-basis point decrease could result in a decrease in interest income of $0.8 million and a principal increase of $1.6 million for a net increase of $0.8 million. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. 47 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:53.400551

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors Which May Impact Future Operating Results.” We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors. Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to an August 2005 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on-demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions. We plan to re-invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer-related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may also in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. As our revenues increase, we expect marketing and sales costs, which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 55 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. 34 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2006, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2006. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on-demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006 and 90 percent during the same period a year ago. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2006 and 2005. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges, employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on-demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services. To the extent that our customer base grows, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. We have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, the costs of upgrading our new development and test data center and allocated overhead. We have 35 Table of Contents historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on-demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We recently upgraded our new development and test data center. We expect the annual cost of this data center to be significant. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. As our revenues increase, we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company, including the cost of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non-employees, option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services. These charges have been significant and are reflected in our historical financial results. These amounts do not include the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options, which we will adopt at the start of fiscal 2007. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2006, we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the venture’s financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January 31, 2006, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make 36 Table of Contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $1,686,000 at January 31, 2006 and $874,000 at January 31, 2005. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the 37 Table of Contents commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2006, we deferred $22.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $14.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $14.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $15.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $17.1 million at January 31, 2006 and $9.6 million at January 31, 2005. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We recorded deferred stock-based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. We have elected not to record stock-based compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock in June 2004, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, our operating and financial performance, private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties, issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm. The fair value of our common stock is now determined by the trading price of our stock on the New York Stock Exchange. We amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the four-year vesting period of the underlying option awards. As of January 31, 2006, we had an aggregate of $2.5 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized. On February 1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007, we will begin to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R (see Recent Accounting Pronouncement below for further discussion). We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations. In the past, we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non-employees. For these options and warrants, we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. As of January 31, 2006, we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to non-employees except for options for 50,000 shares of our common stock, all of which will fully vest by July 2007 and have an exercise price of $2.50 per share. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, tax exposure items or adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million, which included a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. The Company continues to maintain a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. Future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity, which was approximately $40.0 million of the total valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, will be recorded to additional paid-in capital. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

The total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 399,000 as of January 31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. Our gross profit during the year ended January 31, 2006 was $240.7 million, or 78 percent of revenues, and operating income was $20.1 million. Operating income for the period included a non-cash stock-based expense of $3.4 million, which consisted primarily of the amortization of our deferred stock-based compensation. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $142.9 million, or 81 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $6.5 million. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2005 also included $3.6 million of non-cash stock-based expense. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $6.8 million by reducing our valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets. This determination was primarily based on our cumulative profitability over the past several quarters plus the projected current and future taxable income that we expect to realize, particularly in specific tax jurisdictions such as the United States. Additionally, during fiscal 2006, we incurred substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business. We incurred costs related to adding data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the penetration within our existing customer base, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, and developers to broaden and enhance our on-demand service. During the year ended January 31, 2006, we generated $95.9 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $55.9 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $296.8 million, as compared to $205.9 million at January 31, 2005, accounts receivable of $76.1 million at January 31, 2006, as compared to $48.9 million at January 31, 2005, and deferred revenue of $169.2 million at January 31, 2006, as compared to $95.9 million at January 31, 2005. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Total revenues were $309.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $176.4 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.5 million, or 76 percent. Subscription and support 41 Table of Contents revenues were $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 399,000 as of January 31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. Professional services and other revenues were $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $27.3 million, or 77 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $35.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $14.6 million in employee-related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 60 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2005, an increase of $11.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $3.3 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.3 million in allocated overhead charges. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended January 31, 2006 by $5.5 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, together with the requirement to expense stock options beginning in fiscal 2007, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We believe that our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will approximate recent percentages, exclusive of the new requirement to expense stock options. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $13.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $7.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.6 million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a $1.6 million increase in allocated overhead charges. We increased our research and development headcount by 77 percent since January 31, 2005 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. During the year ended January 31, 2006, we capitalized $1.4 million in development costs associated with planned releases of our application service. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $53.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million in employee-related costs, $5.0 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings, advertising and events and a $9.1 million increase in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 72 percent since January 31, 2005 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, 42 Table of Contents during the same period a year ago, an increase of $17.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22.2 million in employee-related costs, $4.1 million in professional and outside service costs and $4.5 million in infrastructure-related costs, which were offset by $15.0 million in increased allocated charges to non-general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 69 percent since January 31, 2005 as we added personnel to support our growth. Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $285,000, which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a $285,000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space. Operating Income. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2006 was $20.1 million. During the same period a year ago, it was $6.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. During the year ended January 31, 2005, interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $7.7 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and was $2.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the $113.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since January 31, 2005. Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the $1.3 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling $7.2 million. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. As of January 31, 2006, we had $7.2 million of deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheet. As of the same date, the Company continues to maintain a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. Future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity, which was approximately $40.0 million of the total valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, will be recorded to additional paid-in-capital. To realize the deferred tax assets related to foreign operations, pretax income in those jurisdictions must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized. Historic profits in those jurisdictions have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date. Without the reduction in our valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 would have been approximately 20 percent. This effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. We currently believe that our fiscal 2007 effective tax rate will be significantly higher than in fiscal 2006. Our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of full-year income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate, the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction and the impact of the new accounting requirement to expense stock options. The estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items. These actual results could vary from those projected. 43 Table of Contents Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues. Total revenues were $176.4 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $96.0 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of $80.4 million, or 84 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004. Professional services and other revenues were $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $18.4 million, or 108 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $16.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily comprised of an increase of $12.1 million in employee-related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 80 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 million in service delivery costs and an increase of $1.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2005 by $2.3 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded. The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $2.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $2.3 million and an increase of $0.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since January 31, 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $41.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $34.3 million in employee-related costs, $3.5 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings and event costs and $3.4 million in allocated overhead. Of the $34.3 million increase in employee-related costs, $7.0 million was related to the increased amortization expense of deferred commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 76 percent since January 31, 2004 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.4 million. The increase was due to an increase of $8.3 million in employee-related costs and $5.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 64 percent since January 31, 2004 as we added personnel to support our growth. The increase in professional and 44 Table of Contents outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the United States. Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $3.4 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlord’s lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space. Operating Income. Operating income during fiscal 2005 was $6.5 million. During fiscal 2004, it was $3.7 million, substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income substantially consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and also includes interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and was $379,000 during fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income tax expense of $1.2 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to a provision for income tax expense of $541,000 for fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes consists of amounts accrued for our estimated domestic federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax liability as well as an estimate of our foreign income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million and accounts receivable of $76.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $95.9 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $55.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $47.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $149.2 million during the same period a year ago, which included the investment of most of the proceeds from our initial public offering in June 2004. The net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2006 primarily related to the changes in restricted cash balances and marketable securities and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force. In February 2005, we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of $8.8 million, which included the cost for support for the first year of the license agreement. Additionally, we obtained additional data center capacity and we upgraded our new development and test data center. For these data center resources, our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for the facilities and computer equipment and contracts for certain services. 45 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $15.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $118.9 million during the same period a year ago. In June 2004, we completed the sale of 11.5 million shares of common stock during our initial public offering. The net proceeds from the initial public offering were $113.8 million. During the year ended January 31, 2006, the $15.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and the $727,000 of proceeds from the collection of notes receivable from shareholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations. As of January 31, 2006, we have a total of $3.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, Switzerland and Singapore. None of these letters of credit are collateralized. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2010. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for additional data center capacity and the new development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2006, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long-term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 825 $ 638 $ 187 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Office space 76,603 20,522 23,624 19,155 13,302 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 49,250 20,758 28,362 130 — Contractual commitments 350 350 — — — Lease abandonment liabilities and other 1,341 186 762 393 — Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. 46 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R on February 1, 2006, which is the start of our next fiscal year. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce our reported results of operations. The full impact is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when additional employees that we plan to hire commence employment, the outcome of our current assessment of different long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the total stock-based expense for all awards before the tax benefit would have approximated the pro forma impact of expensing options as described in Note 1 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, SFAS 123R requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. We currently classify these tax benefits as a source of cash provided by operating activities. These benefits totaled $3,662,000 during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $798,000 for the comparable period a year ago. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million at January 31, 2006. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $1.6 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million. 47 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:53.722268

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to a December 2006 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on-demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition. We plan to re-invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity; upgrading our development and test data center; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer-related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 51 percent of our total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2007 and 48 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2007, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on-demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 90 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although 36 Table of Contents terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on-demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. We have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on-demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding 37 Table of Contents our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company, including the continuing cost of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. As described below, on February 1, 2006 we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which requires companies to expense their stock option awards. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods. These charges are significant and are reflected in our financial results. Prior to February 1, 2006, we recognized stock-based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non-employees and option grants to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, or APB 25. Under APB 25, the compensation expense of stock options to employees was measured based on the difference in the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the option on the date of the grant These differences occurred prior to our June 2004 initial public offering. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2007, we owned a 65 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the venture’s financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January 31, 2007, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $5,232,000 at January 31, 2007 and $1,686,000 at January 31, 2006. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2007, we deferred $37.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $23.4 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $22.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $14.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $31.6 million at January 31, 2007 and $17.1 million at January 31, 2006. 39 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. Effective February 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods. Prior to February 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all employee share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $39.2 million during fiscal 2007. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2007, we had an aggregate of $152.4 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $53.5 million during fiscal 2008; $47.3 million during fiscal 2009; $36.5 million during fiscal 2010; and $15.1 million during fiscal 2011. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2007 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods. The impact of SFAS 123R in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, the application of SFAS 123R requires the use of an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. During fiscal 2007, we awarded 876,303 restricted stock units to our employees. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. During fiscal 2007, the fair value of the restricted units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, which ranged from $29.35 to $39.35 per share, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, prior year tax exposure items or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from SFAS 123R and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except customer and subscriber data).

The adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a significant reduction in our financial operating results. During fiscal 2007, our net income was $481,000, which included $39.2 million of stock-based expenses, or 8 percent of total revenue. Net income during the same period a year ago was $28.5 million. Net income during the year ended January 31, 2006 included a tax benefit of approximately $7.2 million which resulted from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets. This determination was primarily based on our cumulative profitability over the past several quarters plus the projected current and future taxable income that expected to be realized, particularly in specific tax jurisdictions such as the United States. The net income for the year ended January 31, 2006 also included $3.4 million of stock-based expenses, or 1 percent of total revenue. Revenues during fiscal 2007 were $497.1 million, an increase of 60 percent over the same period a year ago. The total number of paying subscriptions increased to approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007 from approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006. Our gross profit during fiscal 2007 was $378.2 million, or 76 percent of revenues, and included stock-based expenses of $5.5 million. Our operating loss was $3.6 million and included stock-based expenses of $39.2 million. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $240.7 million, or 78 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $20.1 million. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2006 also included $3.4 million of stock-based expense. Additionally, during fiscal 2007, we re-invested our revenue growth in an effort to expand our business. We incurred costs related to our data center capacity and upgrading our development and test data center. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, developers to broaden and enhance our on-demand service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business. During fiscal 2007, we generated $111.2 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $95.9 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $412.5 million, as compared to $296.8 million at January 31, 2006, accounts receivable of $128.7 million at January 31, 2007, as compared to $76.1 million at January 31, 2006, and deferred revenue of $284.1 million at January 31, 2007, as compared to $169.2 million at January 31, 2006. 43 Table of Contents On April 10, 2006, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Sendia Corporation, a privately-held on-demand wireless application company based in Santa Monica, California, for $15.5 million in cash including acquisition costs. We believe Sendia’s solution will provide our customers with the increased ability to access on-demand applications via mobile handheld devices. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Total revenues were $497.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $309.9 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $187.2 million, or 60 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007 from approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006. Professional services and other revenues were $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $46.7 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $118.9 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $49.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in employee-related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 59 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2006, an increase of $4.9 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $15.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $5.4 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $2.1 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2007 by $12.0 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded and includes more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, together with the requirement to expense stock options, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2008. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our on-demand application service. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $44.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $21.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $12.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $4.2 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $2.7 million in depreciation expense, equipment and service costs and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 84 percent since January 31, 2006 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the 44 Table of Contents same period a year ago, an increase of $103.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $71.4 million in employee-related costs, $17.1 million in stock-based expenses, $2.9 million in marketing, advertising and event costs, $1.5 million in partner referral fees and $9.2 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 55 percent since January 31, 2006 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $36.3 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $28.8 million in employee-related costs, $9.5 million in stock-based expenses, $6.5 million in infrastructure-related costs and $5.5 million in professional and outside service costs, which were primarily offset by $13.7 million in increased allocated charges to non-general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 62 percent since January 31, 2006 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Operating loss during the year ended January 31, 2007 was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock-based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During the same period a year ago, operating income was $20.1 million and included $3.4 million of stock-based expenses. The increase in our revenues was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. Interest income was $15.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and was $7.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and increased market interest rates. (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the fiscal 2006 $1.3 million income tax benefit was a $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. Prior to the third quarter of last year, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. The (provision) benefit amounts equated to an effective tax rate of 78 percent for the current period and a negative 5 percent for the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2007 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly higher than for the same period a year ago primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized, certain nondeductible stock-based expenses resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance a year ago. Additionally, the impact of adopting SFAS 123R and the business combination accounting adjustments from the acquisition of Sendia Corporation had a significant impact on the calculation of our effective tax rate because these charges significantly lowered our income before provision for income taxes and minority interest and we were not able to recognize a full income tax benefit for the stock-based expenses and foreign losses. See Note 6 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Total revenues were $309.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $176.4 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.5 million, or 76 percent. Subscription and support 45 Table of Contents revenues were $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. Professional services and other revenues were $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $27.3 million, or 77 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $35.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $14.6 million in employee-related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 60 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2005, an increase of $11.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $3.3 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.3 million in allocated overhead charges. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended January 31, 2006 by $5.5 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $13.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $7.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.6 million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a $1.6 million increase in allocated overhead charges. We increased our research and development headcount by 77 percent since January 31, 2005 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. During the year ended January 31, 2006, we capitalized $1.4 million in development costs associated with planned releases of our application service. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $53.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million in employee-related costs, $5.0 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings, advertising and events and a $9.1 million increase in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 72 percent since January 31, 2005 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $17.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22.2 million in employee-related costs, $4.1 million in professional and outside service costs and $4.5 million in infrastructure-related costs, which were offset by $15.0 million in increased allocated charges to non-general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 69 percent since January 31, 2005 as we added personnel to support our growth. 46 Table of Contents Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $285,000, which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a $285,000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space. Operating Income. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2006 was $20.1 million. During the same period a year ago, it was $6.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. During the year ended January 31, 2005, interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $7.7 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and was $2.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the $113.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since January 31, 2005. Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the $1.3 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling $7.2 million. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. As of January 31, 2006, we had $7.2 million of deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheet. As of January 31, 2006, we maintained a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. This effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. See Note 6 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million and accounts receivable of $128.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $111.2 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and $95.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $168.6 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and $47.8 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2007 primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures 47 Table of Contents associated with the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force. In April 2006, we acquired Sendia Corporation for $15.5 million including acquisition costs and in December 2006, we increased our ownership interest in Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com from 63 percent to 65 percent by purchasing some shares held by a minority partner for $2.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $45.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and $15.8 million during the same period a year ago. During the year ended January 31, 2007, the $29.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and $16.6 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations. As of January 31, 2007, we have a total of $5.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York, Singapore and Australia. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2015. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2007, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long-term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 185 $ 179 $ 6 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Office space 136,679 24,574 44,779 32,476 34,850 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 60,794 34,057 26,728 9 — Contractual commitments 1,125 1,125 — — — Lease abandonment liabilities and other 2,107 196 756 267 888 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting 48 Table of Contents and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. During fiscal 2008, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources to take these actions, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has been met. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”). The purpose of SFAS No. 157 is to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements. The measurement and disclosure requirements are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing whether adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have an impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million at January 31, 2007. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $2.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:45.606663

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are the leading provider, based on revenues and market share, of software on demand, according to a July 2007 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on-demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition. We plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer-related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 50 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2008 and 51 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2008, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2008. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on-demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2008. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers 36 Table of Contents typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition,” or SAB 104, and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” or EITF 00-21. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and estimates—Revenue Recognition” below. As we introduce new service offerings such as Unlimited Edition, Partner Edition and Salesforce Sandbox, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 8 percent and 5 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on-demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we have obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States and we intend to open a data center in Asia in fiscal 2009. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on-demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in 37 Table of Contents the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. We account for stock-based expenses pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R which we adopted on February 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires that share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2008, we owned a 65 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the venture’s financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January 31, 2008, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture has not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SAB 104 and EITF 00-21. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $13,922,000 at January 31, 2008 and $5,232,000 at January 31, 2007. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2008, we deferred $62.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $42.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $37.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $23.4 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $52.1 million at January 31, 2008 and $31.6 million at January 31, 2007. 39 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We account for share-based compensation under SFAS 123R. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $55.2 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2008. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of $220.5 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $81.1 million during fiscal 2009; $69.8 million during fiscal 2010; $48.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $21.5 million during fiscal 2012. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2008 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods. We grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise. As of January 31, 2008, we would incur as an operating expense in excess of $5.0 million for these taxes if all vested awards outstanding by employees in these foreign jurisdictions were exercised. This amount is based on the number of vested awards held and the market price of our common stock as of January 31, 2008. The timing of when employees in these foreign jurisdictions exercise their vested awards could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period. The impact of SFAS 123R in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, the application of SFAS 123R requires the use of an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2008, there were 1,717,290 restricted stock units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from SFAS 123R and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).

Net income during the same period a year ago was $481,000, which included $39.2 million of stock-based expenses, or 8 percent of total revenue. Revenues during fiscal 2008 were $748.7 million, an increase of 51 percent over the same period a year ago. The total number of paying subscriptions increased to approximately 1.1 million as of January 31, 2008 from approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007. Our gross profit during fiscal 2008 was $577.1 million, or 77 percent of revenues, and included stock-based expenses of $7.9 million. Our operating income was $20.3 million and included stock-based expenses of $55.2 million. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $378.2 million, or 76 percent of revenues, and had an operating loss of $3.6 million. The operating loss for fiscal 2007 included $39.2 million of stock-based expense. During fiscal 2008, we re-invested our revenue growth in an effort to expand our business. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, developers to broaden and enhance our on-demand service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business. During fiscal 2008, we generated $204.3 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $111.2 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $669.8 million, as compared to $412.5 million at January 31, 2007, accounts receivable of $220.1 million at January 31, 2008, as compared to $128.7 million at January 31, 2007, and deferred revenue, current and noncurrent of $480.9 million at January 31, 2008, as compared to $284.1 million at January 31, 2007. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2008 and 2007 Revenues. Total revenues were $748.7 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $497.1 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $251.6 million, or 51 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $680.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due 43 Table of Contents primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 1.1 million as of January 31, 2008 from approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007. Professional services and other revenues were $68.1 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $190.7 million, or 25 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $81.2 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a larger percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $171.6 million, or 23 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $118.9 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $52.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $16.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $2.4 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $14.0 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $4.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $10.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2008 by $12.2 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded to include more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on-demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, as well as the costs related to our new data center in Asia, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our on-demand application service. Additionally, as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract, our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $63.8 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $44.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $19.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $15.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $1.8 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2007 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $376.5 million, or 50 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $123.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $85.9 million in employee-related costs, $7.0 million in stock-based expenses, $10.8 million in advertising costs, $2.2 million in marketing and event costs, $1.7 million in partner referral fees and $13.9 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 27 percent since January 31, 2007 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. 44 Table of Contents General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $116.5 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $32.2 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, infrastructure-related costs, professional and outside service costs and a legal settlement. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 33 percent since January 31, 2007 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Operating income during fiscal 2008 was $20.3 million and included $55.2 million of stock-based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During the same period a year ago, operating loss was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock-based expenses. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. Interest income was $24.5 million during fiscal 2008 and was $15.0 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Gain on Sale of Investment. Gain on sale of investment consists of the gain we recorded when we sold our shares in a privately held professional service corporation. The gain was $1.3 million for the fiscal 2008, Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $23.4 million during fiscal 2008, compared to a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate decreased to 51 percent for fiscal 2008 compared to 78 percent for the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2008 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly lower than for the same period a year ago primarily due to a reduced proportion of foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to SFAS 123R was $18.5 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Total revenues were $497.1 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $309.9 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $187.2 million, or 60 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007, compared to $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007 from approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006. Professional services and other revenues were $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007, compared to $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007, compared to $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $46.7 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $118.9 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of 45 Table of Contents $49.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in employee- related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 59 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2006, an increase of $4.9 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $15.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $5.4 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $2.1 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2007 by $12.0 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base expanded and includes more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $44.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $21.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $12.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $4.2 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $2.7 million in depreciation expense, equipment and service costs and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 84 percent since January 31, 2006 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $103.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $71.4 million in employee-related costs, $17.1 million in stock-based expenses, $2.9 million in marketing, advertising and event costs, $1.5 million in partner referral fees and $9.2 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 55 percent since January 31, 2006 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $47.7 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $36.6 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, infrastructure-related costs and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 62 percent since January 31, 2006 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Operating loss during fiscal 2007 was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock-based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During the same period a year ago, operating income was $20.1 million and included $3.4 million of stock-based expenses. The increase in our revenues was re-invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. Interest income was $15.0 million during fiscal 2007 and was $7.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and increased market interest rates. (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during fiscal 2007, compared to a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the fiscal 2006 $1.3 million income tax benefit was a $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. 46 Table of Contents The (provision) benefit amounts equated to an effective tax rate of 78 percent for fiscal 2007 and a negative 5 percent for the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2007 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly higher than for the same period a year ago primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized, certain nondeductible stock-based expenses resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance a year ago. Additionally, the impact of adopting SFAS 123R and the business combination accounting adjustments from the acquisition of Sendia Corporation had a significant impact on the calculation of our effective tax rate because these charges significantly lowered our income before provision for income taxes and minority interest and we were not able to recognize a full income tax benefit for the stock-based expenses and foreign losses. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2008, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million and accounts receivable of $220.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $204.3 million during fiscal 2008 and $111.2 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $102.7 million during fiscal 2008 and $168.6 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2008 primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements, development of internal use software and the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure, number of offices around the world and work force. Additionally, in March 2007, we acquired additional developed technology for $5.3 million in cash. Net cash provided by financing activities was $92.7 million during fiscal 2008 and $45.0 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2008 substantially consisted of $60.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $32.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans. As of January 31, 2008, we have a total of $5.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2015. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. 47 Table of Contents Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2008, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 7 $ 7 $ — $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 259,754 47,501 79,772 68,549 63,932 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 53,475 34,577 18,898 — — Contractual commitments 23,972 23,972 — — — Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (“FIN 48”) on February 1, 2007. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2009, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13” (FSP 157-1) and FSP 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 48 Table of Contents 2010. The measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the resulting fair values calculated under SFAS No. 157 after adoption may be different from the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements when it is applied to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities beginning in the first quarter of 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million at January 31, 2008. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points could result in a $3.2 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $2.8 million. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:38.228579

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are the leading provider, based on revenues and market share, of software on demand, according to a July 2008 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. Approximately 55,400 customers worldwide use salesforce.com to manage their customer, sales and operational data. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build Software-as-a-Service applications. Key elements of our strategy include: • Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM ; • Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; • Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; • Continuing to lead the industry transformation to cloud computing; and • Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our application service or delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We also plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally and, towards this end, we are opening a new data center in Singapore in fiscal 2010. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. During the year ended January 31, 2009, we added 960 employees and our headcount as of January 31, 2009 was 3,566. We also plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; add to our infrastructure to support our growth. Additionally, in 36 Table of Contents our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. In August 2008, we acquired InStranet, Inc. which offers a knowledge management application for business to consumer call centers. We acquired InStranet, Inc. for its developed technology in order to expand our CRM customer service and support offerings in the customer service and support market. Additionally during the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our ownership in our Japanese joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 50 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2009 and the same for the period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2009, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2009. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition,” or SAB 104, and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” or EITF 00-21. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire 37 Table of Contents arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 7 percent and 8 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. The following table sets forth our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of the end of each fiscal quarter: (in thousands) April 30,2008 July 31,2008 October 31,2008 January 31,2009 Fiscal 2009 Accounts receivable, net $ 143,909 $ 146,982 $ 157,680 $ 266,555 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 470,297 479,546 469,534 594,026 April 30,2007 July 31,2007 October 31,2007 January 31,2008 Fiscal 2008 Accounts receivable, net $ 105,013 $ 114,046 $ 121,961 $ 220,061 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 295,672 321,852 340,808 480,894 April 30,2006 July 31,2006 October 31,2006 January 31,2007 Fiscal 2007 Accounts receivable, net $ 72,337 $ 75,704 $ 82,808 $ 128,693 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 182,036 202,836 219,431 284,063 Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs. 38 Table of Contents We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we intend to open a data center in Singapore in fiscal 2010. We expect the annual cost to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. We account for stock-based expenses pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R which we adopted on February 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires that share-based payments, including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the venture’s financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors’ interest in the venture’s results. Through January 31, 2009, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture have not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SAB 104 and EITF 00-21. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $17.3 million at January 31, 2009 and $13.9 million at January 31, 2008. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related 40 Table of Contents subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2009, we deferred $63.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $58.7 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $62.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $42.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $57.1 million at January 31, 2009 and $52.1 million at January 31, 2008. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We account for share-based compensation under SFAS 123R. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $77.4 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2009. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of $261.3 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $105.1 million during fiscal 2010; $83.0 million during fiscal 2011; $55.0 million during fiscal 2012; and $18.2 million during fiscal 2013. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2009 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods. We grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise. The impact of SFAS 123R in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, the application of SFAS 123R requires the use of an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2009, there were 2.5 million restricted stock units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. 41 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from SFAS 123R and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Net income during the same period a year ago was $18.4 million, which included $55.2 million of stock-based expenses, or 7 percent of total revenue. Revenues during fiscal 2009 were $1,076.8 million, an increase of 44 percent over the same period a year ago. Our gross profit during fiscal 2009 was $856.3 million, or 80 percent of revenues, and included stock-based expenses of $11.1 million. Our operating income was $63.7 million and included stock-based expenses of $77.4 million. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $577.1 million, or 77 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $20.3 million. Operating income for fiscal 2008 included $55.2 million of stock-based expenses. During fiscal 2009, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers, developers to broaden and enhance our enterprise cloud computing service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business. During fiscal 2009, we generated $229.6 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $204.3 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $882.6 million, as compared to $669.8 million at January 31, 2008, accounts receivable of $266.6 million at January 31, 2009, as compared to $220.1 million at January 31, 2008, and deferred revenue, current and noncurrent of $594.0 million at January 31, 2009, as compared to $480.9 million at January 31, 2008. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance (In thousands) 2009 2008 Dollars Percent Subscription and support $ 984,574 $ 680,581 $ 303,993 45 % Professional services and other 92,195 68,119 24,076 35 % Total revenues $ 1,076,769 $ 748,700 $ 328,069 44 % Total revenues were $1,076.8 million for fiscal 2009, compared to $748.7 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $328.1 million, or 44 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $984.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $680.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to an increased number of new customers, additional paying subscriptions from existing customers, and customers who have upgraded. Professional services and other revenues were $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $68.1 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. 44 Table of Contents Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $190.7 million, or 25 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $109.6 million, or 57 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2009 as compared the same period year ago. The foreign currency impact compared to the same period a year ago was an increase of $6.6 million. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a larger percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2009 2008 Subscription and support $ 127,082 $ 91,268 $ 35,814 Professional services and other 93,389 80,323 13,066 Total cost of revenues $ 220,471 $ 171,591 $ 48,880 Percent of total revenues 20 % 23 % Cost of revenues was $220.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2009, compared to $171.6 million, or 23 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $48.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $13.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.1 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $9.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $10.7 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $3.3 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009 by $1.2 million as compared to $12.2 million during fiscal 2008. This reduction was the result of increasing the utilization of existing professional services staff, utilizing more outside subcontractors and not significantly increasing professional services headcount. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, as well as the costs related to our new data center in Singapore, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract, our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $27.4 million in employee-related costs, an 45 Table of Contents increase of $3.5 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 61 percent since January 31, 2008 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $94.1 million in employee-related costs, $10.6 million in stock-based expenses, $28.9 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.6 million in partner referral fees, $1.4 million of amortized purchased intangibles and $20.3 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 40 percent since January 31, 2008 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

Interest, net was $22.7 million during fiscal 2009 and was $24.5 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.8 million loss for our investment in marketable securities as discussed under “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Due to the current decline in market interest rates since last year and our focus on capital preservation, investment income declined when compared to the same periods in the previous year. Gain on Sale of Investment. Gain on sale of investment of $1.3 million for fiscal 2008 consists of the gain we recorded when we sold our shares in a privately held professional service corporation.

We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded to include more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. Research and Development.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $15.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $1.8 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 32 percent between January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2008 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2008 2007 Marketing and sales $ 376,480 $ 252,935 $ 123,545 Percent of total revenues 50 % 51 % 48 Table of Contents Marketing and sales expenses were $376.5 million, or 50 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, an increase of $123.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $85.9 million in employee-related costs, $7.0 million in stock-based expenses, $10.8 million in advertising costs, $2.2 million in marketing and event costs, $1.7 million in partner referral fees and $13.9 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 27 percent between January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2008 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2008 2007 General and administrative $ 116,508 $ 84,257 $ 32,251 Percent of total revenues 16 % 17 % General and administrative expenses were $116.5 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, an increase of $32.2 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, stock-based expenses, infrastructure-related costs, professional and outside service costs and a legal settlement. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 33 percent between January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2008 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2008 2007 Operating income (loss) $ 20,309 $ (3,598 ) $ 23,907 Percent of total revenues 3 % (1 )% Operating income during fiscal 2008 was $20.3 million and included $55.2 million of stock-based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During fiscal 2007, operating loss was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock-based expenses. Interest, net.

Interest, net was $24.5 million during fiscal 2008 and was $14.8 million during fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Other income. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2008 2007 Other income $ 139 $ 1,310 $ (1,171 ) 49 Table of Contents Other income primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments. Other income decreased due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2008 2007 Provision for income taxes $ (23,385 ) $ (9,795 ) $ (13,590 ) Effective tax rate 51 % 78 % We recorded a provision for income taxes of $23.4 million during fiscal 2008, compared to a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rate decreased to 51 percent for fiscal 2008 compared to 78 percent for fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly lower than for fiscal 2007 primarily due to a reduced proportion of foreign losses for which no tax benefit could be realized. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to SFAS 123R was $18.5 million for fiscal 2008. See Note 7 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million, and accounts receivable of $266.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $229.6 million during fiscal 2009 and $204.3 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income; sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above; the timing of commission and bonus payments; collections from large enterprise customers; add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; and, the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $121.0 million during fiscal 2009 and $102.7 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily related to the acquisition of InStranet, Inc, and the purchase of shares of Salesforce Japan from the minority shareholders. In addition, our investing activities included the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures in leasehold improvements, and the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure, number of offices around the world and work force. We expanded one of our existing software license agreements to provide additional capacity in our business operations at a cost of $8.0 million. The Company during the year invested approximately $2.0 million in system integrators and software-as-a-service ISVs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $96.9 million during fiscal 2009 and $92.7 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 substantially consisted of $43.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $54.6 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans. 50 Table of Contents Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, asset-backed securities and an investment in The Reserve Primary Fund (“The Reserve Fund”), a money market mutual fund that suspended redemptions and is in the process of being liquidated. As of January 31, 2009 our investment portfolio included $19.5 million invested in The Reserve Fund with an estimated fair value of $18.3 million. During the year ended January 31, 2009 we recorded a $1.2 million loss related to this decline in fair value that is considered other-than-temporary. While we believe we have the rights to the recovery of the entire $19.5 million investment, we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive. Therefore, we have recorded the aforementioned other-than-temporary loss. Subsequent to January 31, 2009 we received an additional $6.1 million redemption from The Reserve Fund. As of January 31, 2009, we have a total of $8.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2016. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2009, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 6,444 $ 2,394 $ 4,050 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 257,245 49,502 81,204 67,025 59,514 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 55,391 31,001 24,390 — — Contractual commitments $ 1,526 1,234 292 — — Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (“FIN 48”) on February 1, 2007. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2010, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FSP No. 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (FSP No. 142-3) that amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. FSP No. 142-3 requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under SFAS No. 141(R). The FSP also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset’s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity’s intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of FSP No. 142-3 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 161). The standard requires additional quantitative disclosures (provided in tabular form) and qualitative disclosures for derivative instruments. The required disclosures include how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; the relative volume of derivative activity; the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments; the accounting treatment for those derivative instruments formally designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship; and the existence and nature of credit-risk-related contingent features for derivatives. SFAS 161 does not change the accounting treatment for derivative instruments. SFAS 161 is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13” (FSP 157-1) and FSP 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope, and was effective upon initial adoption of SFAS No. 157. FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements when it is applied to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)). Under SFAS 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred; that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date; and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes. In addition, acquired in-process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. SFAS 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of February 1, 2009, The adoption of SFAS 141(R) is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 52 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51” or SFAS 160. The standard changes the accounting for non-controlling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements including the requirements to classify non-controlling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders’ equity, and the elimination of “minority interest” accounting in results of operations with earnings attributable to non-controlling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings. Additionally, SFAS 160 revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent’s controlling ownership interest. Should we increase our ownership interest in Salesforce Japan, the cost would be recorded as a reduction of our stockholders’ equity as opposed to accounting for the purchase as a step acquisition which requires an allocation of the purchase price. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material impact on our results of operations and consolidated balance sheet. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Prior to October 31, 2008, our practice was to settle foreign currency contracts prior to each quarter end because the maturities of the foreign currency contracts were less than 3 months. We have continued our practice of entering into foreign currency contracts with maturities less than 3 months. As of January 31, 2009 the contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million at January 31, 2009. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. All of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as “available for sale” under SFAS No. 115. Our marketable securities include corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasuries, U.S. agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed securities and money market mutual funds. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2009 could result in a $2.3 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model 53 Table of Contents that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. As previously discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” we have an investment in The Reserve Fund, a money market mutual fund. While we believe we have the rights to the recovery of our entire investment, we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive. At January 31, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $3.2 million. 54 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:40.127084

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications. Key elements of our strategy include: • Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM; • Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; • Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; • Continuing to lead the industry transformation to cloud computing; and • Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our application service, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We also plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans we will have additional focus in the area of retaining customers at the time of renewal. We also plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expand our focus in the locations around the world where we conduct business; and add to our infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to strengthen and extend our service CRM offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. 36 Table of Contents In fiscal 2010, we issued at par $575.0 million 0.75% convertible senior notes due on January 15, 2015. In connection with the issuance of the debt, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. The note hedges transactions are designed, but not guaranteed, to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion. Separately, we also entered into warrant transactions, whereby we sold warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, shares of our common stock at a strike price of $119.51. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2010 and 50 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2010, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2010. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 6 percent and 7 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2010 and 2009 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. 37 Table of Contents Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. (in thousands) April 30,2009 July 31,2009 October 31,2009 January 31,2010 Fiscal 2010 Accounts receivable, net $ 145,869 $ 168,842 $ 191,297 $ 320,956 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 549,373 549,010 545,435 704,348 April 30,2008 July 31,2008 October 31,2008 January 31,2009 Fiscal 2009 Accounts receivable, net $ 143,909 $ 146,982 $ 157,680 $ 266,555 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 470,297 479,546 469,534 594,026 April 30,2007 July 31,2007 October 31,2007 January 31,2008 Fiscal 2008 Accounts receivable, net $ 105,013 $ 114,046 $ 121,961 $ 220,061 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 295,672 321,852 340,808 480,894 Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and 38 Table of Contents secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, referral fees paid to partners, the cost of marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our share-based payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During the prior fiscal year, we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent. Because of this controlling interest, we consolidate the venture’s financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record a noncontrolling interest which reflects the interest that we do not control in the venture’s results. Through January 31, 2010, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture have not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 39 Table of Contents We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $19.1 million at January 31, 2010 and $17.3 million at January 31, 2009. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales representatives. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. 40 Table of Contents During fiscal 2010, we deferred $82.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $63.9 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $63.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $58.7 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $75.5 million at January 31, 2010 and $57.1 million at January 31, 2009. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of approximately four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $88.9 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2010. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of $283.6 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $115.8 million during fiscal 2011; $89.3 million during fiscal 2012; $52.5 million during fiscal 2013; and $26.0 million during fiscal 2014. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2010 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock-based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, we are required to use an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2010, there were 2.3 million restricted stock units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, prior year income tax uncertainties, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses arising from stock-based awards and the changes in tax laws and accounting principles. 41 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).

Subscription and support revenues were $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $1.0 billion, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. Professional services and other revenues were $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $81.5 million, or 27 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2010 2009 Subscription and support $ 159,172 $ 127,082 $ 32,090 Professional services and other 98,753 93,389 5,364 Total cost of revenues $ 257,925 $ 220,471 $ 37,454 Percent of total revenues 20 % 20 % Cost of revenues was $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, compared to $220.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $37.4 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $8.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $1.5 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $7.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $9.8 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $6.7 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $1.6 44 Table of Contents million in allocated overhead. The cost of the professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010 by $2.6 million as compared to $1.2 million during fiscal 2009. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2011. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our application service. Additionally, as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract, our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $25.2 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.3 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $3.5 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 24 percent since January 31, 2009 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $42.0 million in employee-related costs, $3.7 million in stock-based expenses, $17.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs and $6.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 9 percent since January 31, 2009 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $15.7 million in employee-related costs, $3.0 million in stock-based expenses, $4.7 million in infrastructure-related costs, and $10.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 12 percent since January 31, 2009 as we added personnel to support our growth. Income from operations.

Interest expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2010 2009 Interest expense $ (2,000 ) $ (107 ) $ (1,893 ) Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our capital leases. Interest expense was $2.0 million during fiscal 2010 and was $0.1 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to capital leases associated with equipment in expanding our data center capacity. We expect interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal 2011 because of the interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 compared to 44 percent for the same period a year ago. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S. statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $32.1 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which include an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re-valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.7 million during the fiscal 2010 related to this tax law change. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues.

The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The foreign currency impact compared to fiscal 2008 was an increase of $16.6 million. 47 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues.

The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009 by $1.2 million as compared to $12.2 million during fiscal 2008. This reduction was the result of increasing the utilization of existing professional services staff, utilizing more outside subcontractors and not significantly increasing professional services headcount.

(In thousands) Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars 2009 2008 Other income (expense) $ (817 ) $ 139 $ (956 ) Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income (expense) decreased due to realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Provision for Income Taxes. (In thousands) Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars 2009 2008 Provision for income taxes $ (37,557 ) $ (23,385 ) $ (14,172 ) Effective tax rate 44 % 51 % The fiscal 2009 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interest was significantly lower than fiscal 2008 primarily due to a reduced proportion of foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized and increased tax credits. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to stock-based expenses was $26.3 million for fiscal 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2010, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion and accounts receivable of $321.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $270.9 million during fiscal 2010 and $229.6 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income, sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, and the timing of commission and bonus payments, collections from large enterprise customers, and add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $378.6 million during fiscal 2010 and $121.0 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2010 primarily related to the investment of cash balances and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements, and the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure, number of offices around the world and work force. Additionally, during the year we purchased two privately held companies for approximately $12.0 million and invested approximately $4.4 million in other privately-held companies. Net cash provided by financing activities was $637.2 million during fiscal 2010 and $96.9 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2010 substantially consisted of the net proceeds of $499.9 million related to our issuance of convertible notes and associated hedge transactions described below. In addition we had $93.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $51.5 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans. 50 Table of Contents In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “Warrants”). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. As of January 31, 2010, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants. For further information, see Note 2 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds. As of January 31, 2010, we have a total of $10.6 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through October 2018. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long-term liabilities related to the issuance of the Notes. The stated interest rate is 0.75%. At January 31, 2010, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 15,583 $ 7,249 $ 8,334 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 229,201 49,930 83,405 45,180 50,686 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 51,008 32,011 18,997 — — Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 596,515 4,265 8,625 583,625 — Contractual commitments 14,553 13,388 1,165 — — Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. The timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. 51 Table of Contents We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2011, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Update No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (ASU 2009-13). It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605-25. The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption. We are currently assessing the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement to our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion at January 31, 2010. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2010 could result in a $13.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity 52 Table of Contents model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $2.3 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the “Notes”). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedges transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. Our Notes have fixed annual interest rates at 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on our Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $450.2 million as of January 31, 2010. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2010. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2010 was $545.2 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of our Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, which was $94.82.

1108524,CRM,"Salesforce, Inc.",2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled of this Annual Report on Form 10-K “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions and enhanced features. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. In 2010 we introduced our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our CRM service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties. We also introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real-time. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications. Key elements of our strategy include: • Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM; • Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; • Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; • Continuing to lead the industry transformation to the next phase of cloud computing; and • Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our Force.com cloud computing platform. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our application service, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our Force.com platform. We plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans, we intend to continue focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. 33 Table of Contents Additionally, we plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; continue to develop our brands; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings; develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies; and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. As such, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2012 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 to be significantly lower than diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011. In November 2010, we paid $278.0 million in cash for approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage, which we plan to develop into our global headquarters. During fiscal 2011 we acquired several companies to strengthen and extend our service offerings. We spent approximately $403.3 million, net of cash acquired, for these companies. In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (“Salesforce Japan”), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist with our sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, we acquired SunBridge’s and other shareholders’ interest in, and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of, Salesforce Japan for cash payments totaling $172.0 million. In fiscal 2010, we issued at par $575.0 million 0.75% convertible senior notes (“notes”) due on January 15, 2015. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, based on the terms of the Notes, the Notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2011 and 46 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2011, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2011. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service, varying service types of offering and the subscription price of our service. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing service. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and each such user is who we call a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009. 34 Table of Contents Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 6 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. At the start of fiscal 2012 we will be adopting the provisions of ASU 2009-13. Adopting this provision will change our accounting for multiple-element arrangements, see Recent Accounting Pronouncement. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. 35 Table of Contents Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. (in thousands) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 October 31,2010 January 31,2011 Fiscal 2011 Accounts receivable, net $ 183,612 $ 228,550 $ 258,764 $ 426,943 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 664,529 683,019 694,557 934,941 April 30,2009 July 31,2009 October 31,2009 January 31,2010 Fiscal 2010 Accounts receivable, net $ 145,869 $ 168,842 $ 191,297 $ 320,956 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 549,373 549,010 545,435 704,348 April 30,2008 July 31,2008 October 31,2008 January 31,2009 Fiscal 2009 Accounts receivable, net $ 143,909 $ 146,982 $ 157,680 $ 266,555 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 470,297 479,546 469,534 594,026 Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. For example, we plan to open additional data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies. 36 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our share-based payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. If our grant activity remains consistent and our stock price increases in the future, stock-based expenses will rise. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (“Salesforce Japan”), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, we acquired SunBridge’s and other shareholders’ interest in, and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of, Salesforce Japan. As a result of our purchase of the shares held by SunBridge, the joint venture agreement terminated according to its terms. As we did not obtain 100 percent ownership until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2011, which reflects the interest that we did not control in Salesforce Japan’s results in fiscal 2011 and all prior years presented. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. 37 Table of Contents We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $28.1 million at January 31, 2011 and $19.1 million at January 31, 2010. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, net. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2011, we deferred $121.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $80.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $82.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $63.9 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $116.6 million at January 31, 2011 and $75.5 million at January 31, 2010. Business Combinations. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We use the best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to 38 Table of Contents goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. Accounting for Stock-Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock-based expense of $120.4 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2011. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $559.8 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $195.1 million during fiscal 2012; $157.9 million during fiscal 2013; $129.6 million during fiscal 2014; $76.8 million during fiscal 2015 and $0.4 million during fiscal 2016. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2011 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share-based awards to our employees in future periods, which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs, as applicable by jurisdiction, when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock-based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock-based expenses. Additionally, we are required to use an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2011, there were 3.2 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future. The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and accounting principles. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).

Subscription and support revenues were $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2011 has remained substantially consistent relative to fiscal 2010. Professional services and other revenues were $106.0 million, or 6 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $140.3 million, or 37 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, and our focus on marketing our service internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of reducing our aggregate revenues by $7.6 million compared to the same period a year ago. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the Americas to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Subscription and support $ 208,243 $ 159,172 $ 49,071 Professional services and other 115,570 98,753 16,817 Total cost of revenues $ 323,813 $ 257,925 $ 65,888 Percent of total revenues 20 % 20 % Cost of revenues was $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $22.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $9.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $16.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $13.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $3.6 million in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in stock based expenses. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2011 by $9.6 million as compared to $2.6 million during fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services during fiscal 2012. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our application service. Research and Development. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Research and development $ 187,887 $ 131,897 $ 55,990 Percent of total revenues 11 % 10 % Research and development expenses were $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $131.9 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $56.0 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $42.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.8 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $5.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 47 percent since January 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Marketing and sales $ 792,029 $ 605,199 $ 186,830 Percent of total revenues 48 % 46 % 43 Table of Contents Marketing and sales expenses were $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $605.2 million, or 46 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $186.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $143.1 million in employee-related costs, $16.7 million in stock-based expenses, $12.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization, and $12.6 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 34 percent since January 31, 2010 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $46.8 million in employee-related costs, $9.5 million in stock-based expenses, and increases in depreciation and amortization, service delivery costs, and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 30 percent since January 31, 2010 as we added personnel to support our growth. Income from operations.

Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Investment income $ 37,735 $ 30,408 $ 7,327 Percent of total revenues 2 % 2 % Investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $37.7 million during fiscal 2011 and was $30.4 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased realized gains from sales of marketable securities and the increase in marketable securities balances resulting from cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises and the convertible senior notes. Interest expense.

Interest expense was $24.9 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2011 and was $2.0 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes and capital leases associated with equipment acquired to expand our data center capacity. During fiscal 2011, we capitalized $4.0 million of interest costs related to major construction projects, specifically our campus project and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. We will continue to capitalize interest on these projects until these assets are ready for service. Other expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Other expense $ (6,025 ) $ (1,299 ) $ (4,726 ) Other expense primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses.

Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Provision for income taxes $ (34,601 ) $ (57,689 ) $ 23,088 Effective tax rate 33 % 41 % The provision for income taxes was $34.6 million during fiscal 2011, compared to $57.7 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for the same period a year ago. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S statutory tax rate, as well as increased tax credits. The extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $44.1 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re-valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million and $2.7 million related to this tax law change during 2011 and 2010 respectively.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 compared to 44 percent for fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S. statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $32.1 million for fiscal 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion and accounts receivable of $426.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $459.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $270.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base, increases in the contract values of our subscription service contracts, improving renewal rates and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income; sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, the timing of commission and bonus payments, and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers; add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal 2011 and $378.6 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily related to the purchase of Jigsaw, Heroku, DimDim, the purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California, investment of cash balances, and capital expenditures and strategic investments in public and private companies. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage for approximately $278.0 million in cash. We plan to use the land to build our new global headquarters and therefore will devote additional financial resources in the future to build our new headquarters. 48 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $14.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $637.2 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of $160.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $36.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, offset by the $172.0 million in purchases of Salesforce Japan shares held by others and $10.4 million of principal payments on capital leases. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “Warrants”). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. As of January 31, 2011, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, government obligations and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2011, we have a total of $8.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through September 2021. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2011, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 18,637 $ 10,830 $ 7,807 $ 0 $ 0 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 436,944 75,166 150,438 91,549 119,791 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 62,340 32,177 30,163 0 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 592,251 4,313 8,625 579,313 0 Contractual commitments 1,603 3 1,600 0 0 As of February 1, 2011 the Notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder.

Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to 49 Table of Contents the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. This potential repayment of the Notes is not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above. We have a contractual obligation to begin construction on the undeveloped land by September 2014. If we do not commence construction by this date we will be subject to certain penalties due to a third party. These potential penalties are not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above. We do not believe we will be subject to these penalties. Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. The timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2012, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources to do so, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Update No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (ASU 2009-13). It updates the existing multiple-element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605-25. The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009-13 will be effective for us at the start of fiscal 2012. We believe the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement will not be material to our consolidated net income. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at January 31, 2011. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2011 could result in a $27.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.1 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the “Notes”). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. As of February 1, 2011 the Notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal 51 Table of Contents amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, as of February 1, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $472.5 million as of January 31, 2011. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2011. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2011 was $946.1 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $164.55. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for the minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. At January 31, 2011, the fair value of these investments was $27.1 million. 52 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:48.431160

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled of this Annual Report on Form 10-K “Risk Factors.” Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions, and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises. Social enterprises leverage social, mobile and open technologies to place their customers and employees at the center of their business and to engage and collaborate with them in new and powerful ways. Our technologies are targeted at businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise customer relationship management (“CRM”) application service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions, services and enhanced features. Over the last few years, we have both developed and acquired several mobile, social and open technologies to help our customers become social enterprises. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. We launched our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications and services that are integrated with our flagship CRM product and in most cases have been developed on our Force.com platform by third parties. We introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real-time. Recently we enabled companies to invite their customers to collaborate with Chatter in private groups on this corporate social network. Our Salesforce Data.com (“Data.com”) offering, which provides some contacts from Jigsaw Data Corporation (“Jigsaw”), provides the most complete source of accurate business data and seamlessly integrates with our CRM products. We also expanded our platform offering via the acquisition of Heroku, Inc. (“Heroku”) an application development platform and the launch of Database.com, the world’s first enterprise cloud database. We acquired Radian6 Technologies, Inc. (“Radian6”) to help companies monitor and engage with their customers via social media. Our objective is to help companies put customers at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by leveraging our applications and platforms. Key elements of our strategy include: • Strengthening our existing sales and service cloud applications and extending into new functional areas within the social enterprise; • Leading the industry transformation to the social enterprise; • Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; • Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; • Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of 33 Table of Contents additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity. We also plan to continue to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans, we intend to continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Additionally, we plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; continue to develop our brands; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings; develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies; and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. As such, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2013 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. During fiscal 2012, we acquired several businesses and technologies to strengthen and extend our service offerings. In May 2011, we acquired Radian6 for a total purchase consideration of approximately $336.6 million, net of cash acquired. Radian6 is a cloud application vendor that provides customers with social media monitoring, measurement and engagement solutions. We acquired Radian6 for its developed technology, assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Radian6’s social solution technology with our current product offerings. In September 2011, we acquired Assistly for a total purchase consideration of approximately $58.7 million. Assistly is a cloud-based provider of customer service solutions. We acquired Assistly for its developed help desk application technology in order to expand our customer service market opportunities in the small and emerging business market. In order to expand our mobile and social consulting services, in December 2011, we acquired Model Metrics, a cloud computing professional services company, for a total purchase consideration of approximately $66.7 million. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 52 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2012 and 48 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2012, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. 34 Table of Contents Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from: (1) subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services; (2) support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; (3) professional services, which include consulting services such as process mapping and project management, and implementation services including systems integration, technical architecture and development, and data conversion; and (4) other revenue, which consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2012. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and service renewal rates. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Revenue Recognition” below. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the new guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year. 35 Table of Contents Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Currently, there is greater operational discipline around annual invoicing, for both new business and renewals. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: (in thousands) April 30,2011 July 31,2011 October 31,2011 January 31,2012 Fiscal 2012 Accounts receivable, net $ 270,816 $ 342,397 $ 312,331 $ 683,745 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 915,133 935,266 917,821 1,380,295 (in thousands) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 October 31,2010 January 31,2011 Fiscal 2011 Accounts receivable, net $ 183,612 $ 228,550 $ 258,764 $ 426,943 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 664,529 683,019 694,557 934,941 (in thousands) April 30,2009 July 31,2009 October 31,2009 January 31,2010 Fiscal 2010 Accounts receivable, net $ 145,869 $ 168,842 $ 191,297 $ 320,956 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 549,373 549,010 545,435 704,348 Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue was over $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012 and over $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2011. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. 36 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. 37 Table of Contents Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from business combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: • There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; • The service has been or is being provided to the customer; • The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and • The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support, and professional services. 38 Table of Contents Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We have applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 31, 2012, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $30.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our 39 Table of Contents go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. As a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2012, we deferred $167.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $107.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $121.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $80.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $176.6 million at January 31, 2012 and $116.6 million at January 31, 2011. Business Combinations. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. 40 Table of Contents Stock-Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of generally four years or one year for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated life for the stock options is based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for the ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the offering period. The risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. We estimate the future stock price volatility considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights. We recognized stock-based expense of $229.3 million during fiscal 2012. The requirement to expense stock-based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2012, we had an aggregate of $820.6 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $296.5 million during fiscal 2013; $256.4 million during fiscal 2014; $196.1 million during fiscal 2015 and $71.6 million during fiscal 2016. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2012 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods, which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs, as applicable by jurisdiction, when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock-based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long-term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates. Additionally, we are required to use an option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2012, there were 5.0 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future. The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vests over four years. The fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax-effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and accounting principles. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is 41 Table of Contents measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Strategic Investments. We report our investments in marketable equity securities at fair market value using the quoted prices in their respective active markets. We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than temporary impairment.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2012 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2011. Professional services and other revenues were $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $106.0 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $204.1 million, or 39 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by $36.9 million compared to the same period a year ago. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the Americas to increase as a percentage of our total revenues worldwide. Cost of Revenues.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $20.4 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.3 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $39.8 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $68.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $44.6 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets, an increase of $24.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $5.5 million in allocated overhead. Gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved over the same period a year ago primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple-deliverable arrangements. 45 Table of Contents We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $66.7 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $27.0 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in our development and test data center, an increase of $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of $8.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 52 percent since January 31, 2011 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $255.6 million in employee-related costs, $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, $22.5 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $21.8 million in allocated overhead, $8.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, $3.1 million in depreciation and amortization and the preliminary settlement of the California wage and hour case discussed in Note 8. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 44 percent since January 31, 2011 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative.

Interest expense was $17.0 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2012 and was $24.9 million during the same period a year ago. During fiscal 2012, we capitalized $14.6 million of interest costs related to capital projects, specifically costs related to our real estate holdings, which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. Capitalized interest during the same period a year ago was $4.0 million. Other expense.

Other expense decreased primarily due to the net gain of $2.9 million from activity within our portfolio of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately-held companies offset by realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2012 compared to the same period a year ago. 47 Table of Contents Benefit (provision) for income taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 21,745 $ (34,601 ) $ 56,346 Effective tax rate 65 % 33 % The benefit for income taxes was $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, compared to an income tax provision of $34.6 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for the same period a year ago. The higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and California tax credits and a tax benefit related to the May 2011 acquisition of Radian6. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in foreign tax rate differential. Foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pre-tax income. The combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate. The lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items. First, California enacted several income tax law changes, which generally benefited California-based companies. The result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate. Second, the company was subject to minimum state taxes, which reduced the state tax benefit. The combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit. Note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 to re-value the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences related to this tax law change. We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014 respectively. The Singapore program is eligible for renewal. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $76.0 million for fiscal 2012. See Note 6 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.

Subscription and support revenues were $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to fiscal 2010. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2011 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2010. Professional services and other revenues were $106.0 million, or 6 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. 48 Table of Contents Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $140.3 million, or 37 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, and our focus on marketing our service internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The foreign currency impact had the effect of reducing our aggregate revenues by $7.6 million compared to fiscal 2010. Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Subscription and support $ 208,243 $ 159,172 $ 49,071 Professional services and other 115,570 98,753 16,817 Total cost of revenues $ 323,813 $ 257,925 $ 65,888 Percent of total revenues 20 % 20 % Cost of revenues was $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $22.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $9.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $16.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $13.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $3.6 million in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in stock based expenses. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2011 by $9.6 million as compared to $2.6 million during fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. Research and Development. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Research and development $ 187,887 $ 131,897 $ 55,990 Percent of total revenues 11 % 10 % Research and development expenses were $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $131.9 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $56.0 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $42.0 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $5.8 million in stock-based expenses, and an increase of $5.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 47 percent since January 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Marketing and sales $ 792,029 $ 605,199 $ 186,830 Percent of total revenues 48 % 46 % 49 Table of Contents Marketing and sales expenses were $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $605.2 million, or 46 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $186.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $143.1 million in employee-related costs, $16.7 million in stock-based expenses, $12.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization, and $12.6 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 34 percent since January 31, 2010 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 General and administrative $ 255,913 $ 195,290 $ 60,623 Percent of total revenues 15 % 15 % General and administrative expenses were $255.9 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $195.3 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $60.6 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $46.8 million in employee-related costs, $9.5 million in stock-based expenses, and increases in depreciation and amortization, service delivery costs, and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 30 percent since January 31, 2010 as we added personnel to support our growth. Income from operations. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Income from operations $ 97,497 $ 115,272 $ (17,775 ) Percent of total revenues 6 % 9 % Income from operations during fiscal 2011 was $97.5 million and included $120.4 million of stock-based expenses and $19.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During fiscal 2010, operating income was $115.3 million and included $88.9 million of stock-based expenses and $11.3 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Investment income. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Investment income $ 37,735 $ 30,408 $ 7,327 Percent of total revenues 2 % 2 % Investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $37.7 million during fiscal 2011 and was $30.4 million during fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in marketable securities balances resulting from cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises and the convertible senior notes. Interest expense.

Interest expense was $24.9 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2011 and was $2.0 million during fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes and capital leases associated with equipment acquired to expand our data center capacity. During fiscal 2011, we capitalized $4.0 million of interest costs related to major capital projects, specifically our campus project and our capitalized internal-use software development costs. Other expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Other expense $ (6,025 ) $ (1,299 ) $ (4,726 ) Other expense primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense increased due to realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Provision for income taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Provision for income taxes $ (34,601 ) $ (57,689 ) $ 23,088 Effective tax rate 33 % 41 % The provision for income taxes was $34.6 million during fiscal 2011, compared to $57.7 million during fiscal 2010. Our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S statutory tax rate, as well as increased tax credits. The extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation was $44.1 million for fiscal 2011. See Note 6 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income impacted us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re-valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million and $2.7 million related to this tax law change during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (Topic 805)—Business Combinations (“ASU 2010-29”), to improve consistency in how the pro forma disclosures are calculated. Additionally, ASU 2010-29 enhances the disclosure requirements and requires description of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination. ASU 2010-29 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 and should be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the effective date. We do not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010-29 will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)—Presentation of Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2011-05”), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 and should be applied retrospectively. We do not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion and accounts receivable of $683.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $591.5 million during fiscal 2012 and $459.1 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income (loss); sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, the timing of commission and bonus payments, and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers; add-backs of non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stock-based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $489.7 million during fiscal 2012 and $1.1 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 primarily related to the purchase of Model Metrics in December 2011, the purchase of Assistly in September 2011, the purchase of Radian6 in May 2011, the purchase of Manymoon in February 2011, investment of cash balances, capital expenditures and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $75.9 million during fiscal 2012 and $14.1 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of $116.6 million of proceeds from equity plans and $6.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, offset by $30.5 million of principal payments on capital leases and $16.2 million of contingent consideration payments. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “Warrants”). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending January 31, 2012. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, our common stock did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, government obligations and municipal securities. 52 Table of Contents As of January 31, 2012, we have a total of $17.5 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through April 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2012, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 60,997 $ 27,585 $ 30,125 $ 3,287 $ 0 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 607,738 91,625 148,080 117,718 250,315 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 60,082 32,622 27,460 0 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 587,938 4,313 583,625 0 0 Contractual commitments 200 100 100 0 0 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In January 2012, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 400,000 rentable square feet at 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA. The cost of the lease is approximately $209.0 million over the 18-year term of the lease. We will take possession of the premises in phases beginning April 1, 2012. Our commitment is included in the table above. On June 7, 2011, we entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with respect to a California state wage and hour lawsuit that had been filed against us early in 2011 in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. The settlement agreement is subject to approval of the court, which is expected to rule by mid 2012. Our current estimate of the expense charge for the settlement is approximately $0.04 per diluted share. This charge is reflected in our financial results for fiscal 2012. We anticipate making a tax payment of approximately $40.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as a result of the Radian6 transaction. Besides the aforementioned Radian6 tax payment, the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. 53 Table of Contents During fiscal 2013, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. We use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. These certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. • Stock-Based Expenses. The company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. • Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the company’s $575 million of convertible subordinated notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010. The imputed interest rate is approximately 5.9%, while the coupon interest rate is 0.75%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the company’s operational performance. 54 Table of Contents • Income Tax Effects. The company’s non-GAAP effective tax rate excludes the tax effect of the expense items described above. We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles, as described above, that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles, as described above, that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, “gross profit,” “income (loss) from operations,” “net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com” and “Diluted earnings (loss) per share” for the years ended January 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows (in thousands): For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP gross profit 2012 2011 2010 GAAP gross profit $ 1,777,653 $ 1,333,326 $ 1,047,658 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 60,069 15,459 8,010 Stock-based expenses 17,451 12,158 12,570 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 1,855,173 $ 1,360,943 $ 1,068,238 55 Table of Contents For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP operating profit 2012 2011 2010 GAAP income (loss) from operations $ (35,085 ) $ 97,497 $ 115,272 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 67,319 19,668 11,251 Stock-based expenses 229,258 120,429 88,892 Non-GAAP operating profit $ 261,492 $ 237,594 $ 215,415 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP net income attributable to salesforce.com 2012 2011 2010 GAAP net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com $ (11,572 ) $ 64,474 $ 80,719 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 67,319 19,668 $ 11,251 Stock-based expenses 229,258 120,429 88,892 Amortization of debt discount, net 12,335 19,079 728 Less: Income tax effect of non-GAAP items (103,730 ) (57,544 ) (34,582 ) Non-GAAP net income attributable to salesforce.com $ 193,610 $ 166,106 $ 147,008 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 2012(a) 2011 2010 GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.09 ) $ 0.47 $ 0.63 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.47 0.14 0.09 Stock-based expenses 1.62 0.88 0.69 Amortization of debt discount, net 0.09 0.14 0.00 Less: Income tax effect of non-GAAP items (0.73 ) (0.41 ) (0.26 ) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to salesforce.com $ 1.36 $ 1.22 $ 1.15 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 142,295 136,598 128,114 (a) Reported GAAP loss per share was calculated using the basic share count.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at January 31, 2012. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2012 could result in a $12.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $27.7 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the “Notes”). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. For the three months ended January 31, 2012 the Notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, our common stock traded did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible. 57 Table of Contents The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $496.1 million as of January 31, 2012. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2012. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2012 was $869.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which was $151.25. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these investments was $48.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. 58 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:55.646162

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the simple concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or “cloud.” We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into “customer companies” by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core services—Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce Platform—customers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include: • Strengthening our market-leading core solutions; • Innovating in high-growth markets; • Improve renewal rates; • Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; • Pursuing new customers aggressively; • Building our business in top markets globally; and • Encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, 30 Table of Contents encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Marketing Cloud and Salesforce Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we anticipate we will have net losses on a GAAP basis for the next several quarters. In November 2010, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land. We have capitalized all pre-construction activities related to the development of the land, including interest costs and property taxes since the November 2010 purchase. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity. The total carrying value of the land, building improvements and perpetual parking rights was $321.1 million as of January 31, 2013. We continue to evaluate our future needs for office facilities space and our options for the undeveloped real estate. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2013 and 52 percent for fiscal 2012, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. On August 13, 2012, we acquired the outstanding stock of Buddy Media, Inc., (“Buddy”), a social media marketing platform. We acquired Buddy for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Buddy’s social media marketing platform with our current offerings. The financial results of Buddy are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for Buddy was $735.8 million. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence as of October 31, 2013 and recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 in the amount of $149.1 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. This accounting treatment has no effect on our actual ability to utilize deferred tax assets such as loss carryforwards and tax credits to reduce future cash tax payments. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2013, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2013. 31 Table of Contents Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2013. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and service renewal rates. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the new guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which was the beginning of our fiscal 2012. 32 Table of Contents Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we introduced greater operational discipline around annual invoicing, for both new business and renewals which resulted in an increase in deferred revenue. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 marks the one year anniversary of this operational shift, therefore the incremental benefit to deferred revenue from annual invoicing was lower than it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: (in thousands) April 30,2012 July 31,2012 October 31,2012 January 31,2013 Fiscal 2013 Accounts receivable, net $ 371,395 $ 446,917 $ 418,590 $ 872,634 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,334,716 1,337,184 1,291,703 1,862,995 (in thousands) April 30,2011 July 31,2011 October 31,2011 January 31,2012 Fiscal 2012 Accounts receivable, net $ 270,816 $ 342,397 $ 312,331 $ 683,745 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 915,133 935,266 917,821 1,380,295 (in thousands) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 October 31,2010 January 31,2011 Fiscal 2011 Accounts receivable, net $ 183,612 $ 228,550 $ 258,764 $ 426,943 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 664,529 683,019 694,557 934,941 Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013 and approximately $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012. Due to our sales to large enterprise accounts, we are experiencing longer contractual commitments by our customers which is reflected in our growing unbilled deferred revenue. Also as a result, our average contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. This has a positive impact on our renewal rate. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero 33 Table of Contents just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute 34 Table of Contents dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. For fiscal 2013, we recognized stock-based expense of $379.4 million. As of January 31, 2013, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses was $1.2 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $491.0 million during fiscal 2014; $394.2 million during fiscal 2015; $249.8 million during fiscal 2016; and $92.5 million during fiscal 2017. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2013 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: • There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; • The service has been or is being provided to the customer; • The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and • The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. 35 Table of Contents Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support, and professional services. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple-deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements—a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force” (“ASU 2009-13”) which amended the previous multiple-deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We have applied the updated accounting guidance to those multiple-deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which was the beginning of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. As of January 31, 2013, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $9.3 million and approximately $3.9 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple-deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the 36 Table of Contents services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. As a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. 37 Table of Contents During fiscal 2013, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $167.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $107.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $254.4 million at January 31, 2013 and $176.6 million at January 31, 2012. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Strategic Investments. We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; • expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; • the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; 38 Table of Contents • uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Stock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The fair value of each option or award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: • The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; • The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; and • The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights. Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Examples of positive and negative evidence include historical taxable income or losses, forecasted income or losses, the estimated timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized. Our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and accounting principles as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders’ equity. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2013 2012 2011 Revenues: Subscription and support $ 2,868,808 $ 2,126,234 $ 1,551,145 Professional services and other 181,387 140,305 105,994 Total revenues 3,050,195 2,266,539 1,657,139 Cost of revenues: Subscription and support 494,187 360,758 208,243 Professional services and other 189,392 128,128 115,570 Total cost of revenues 683,579 488,886 323,813 Gross profit 2,366,616 1,777,653 1,333,326 Operating expenses: Research and development 429,479 295,347 187,887 Marketing and sales 1,614,026 1,169,610 792,029 General and administrative 433,821 347,781 255,913 Total operating expenses 2,477,326 1,812,738 1,235,829 Income (loss) from operations (110,710 ) (35,085 ) 97,497 Investment income 19,562 23,268 37,735 Interest expense (30,948 ) (17,045 ) (24,909 ) Other expense (5,698 ) (4,455 ) (6,025 ) Income (loss) before benefit from (provision for) income taxes and noncontrolling interest (127,794 ) (33,317 ) 104,298 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes (142,651 ) 21,745 (34,601 ) Consolidated net income (loss) (270,445 ) (11,572 ) 69,697 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 0 0 (5,223 ) Net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com $ (270,445 ) $ (11,572 ) $ 64,474 As of January 31, 2013 2012 Balance Sheet Data: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,758,285 $ 1,447,174 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,862,995 1,380,295 Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013 and $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $200.2 million, or 28 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to the same period a year ago. 43 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $77.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $16.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $36.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $37.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $17.2 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets and an increase of $14.6 million in allocated overhead. We have increased our headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2012 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $92.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $30.4 million in stock-based expenses and an increase of $8.8 million in our development and test data center. We increased our research and development headcount by 36 percent since January 31, 2012 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2014 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. 44 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $305.9 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $83.6 million in stock-based expenses, $29.3 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and $23.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to the same period a year ago. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.

The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. See Note 8 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. We recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss. 46 Table of Contents We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively. The Singapore program, however, is eligible for renewal. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2012 and 2011 Revenues.

The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by $36.9 million compared to fiscal 2011. Cost of Revenues.

Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 21,745 $ (34,601 ) $ 56,346 Effective tax rate 65 % 33 % The benefit for income taxes was $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, compared to an income tax provision of $34.6 million during fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for fiscal 2011. The higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and California tax credits and a tax benefit related to the May 2011 acquisition of Radian6. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in the foreign tax rate differential. Foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pre-tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pre-tax income. The combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate. The lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items. First, California enacted several income tax law changes, which generally benefited California-based companies. The result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate. Second, the Company was subject to minimum state taxes, which reduced the state tax benefit. The combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit. Note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 to re-value the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences related to this tax law change. We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncement In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2012-02, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)—Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02), to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. ASU 2012-02 permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying value. Otherwise, the quantitative impairment test is not required. We plan to adopt ASU 2012-02 in fiscal 2014 and do not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2013, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion and accounts receivable of $872.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $736.9 million during fiscal 2013 and $591.5 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. 50 Table of Contents Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Additionally, due to continually increased annual cycle billing patterns, the value of customer billings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to a higher accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of January 31, 2013 than as of January 31, 2012. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices 30 days in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. In fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities increased $145.4 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and changes in working capital accounts which include the establishment of the tax valuation allowance during the year. Net cash used in investing activities was $938.9 million during fiscal 2013 and $489.7 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2013 primarily related to the purchase of Rypple, Inc. (“Rypple”) in February 2012, the purchase of Buddy in August 2012, the purchase of GoInstant, Inc. (“GoInstant”) in September 2012, capital expenditures, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $334.5 million during fiscal 2013 and $75.9 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2013 consisted primarily of $351.4 million of proceeds from equity plans and $14.9 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans offset by $31.8 million of principal payments on capital leases. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “Warrants”). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. To date, there has been a nominal amount of conversions. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2012, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending January 31, 2013. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2013, and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet. 51 Table of Contents Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2013, we have a total of $60.8 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2013, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows (in thousands): (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 66,853 $ 31,694 $ 22,400 $ 12,759 $ 0 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 1,505,059 108,301 233,378 250,428 912,952 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 81,356 43,046 38,310 0 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 583,626 4,313 579,313 0 0 Contractual commitments 7,072 3,472 3,600 0 0 Total $ 2,243,966 $ 190,826 $ 877,001 $ 263,187 $ 912,952 The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. During fiscal 2014 and future fiscal years, we expect to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal 2014 than in fiscal 2013 as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. 52 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. These certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. • Stock-Based Expenses. The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. • Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company’s $575 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010. The imputed interest rate is approximately 5.9%, while the coupon interest rate is 0.75%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance. • One-time Tax Charge. As a result of the Company assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge to income tax 53 Table of Contents expense to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of those assets. The Company applied significant judgment as part of this analysis including considering the Company’s past operating results, cumulative losses and forecasts of future taxable income. As part of establishing a valuation allowance with respect to the company’s deferred tax assets, the company will assess and record any necessary quarterly changes to the valuation allowance and the corresponding income tax expense or benefit. Management believes that the exclusion of this non-cash charge is appropriate to provide investors with a better view of the company’s operational performance. • Income Tax Effects and Adjustments. The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal year’s ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Company’s operational performance We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 54 Table of Contents Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, “gross profit,” “income (loss) from operations,” “net income (loss)” and “Diluted earnings (loss) per share” for the years ended January 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 are as follows (in thousands): For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP gross profit 2013 2012 2011 GAAP gross profit $ 2,366,616 $ 1,777,653 $ 1,333,326 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 77,249 60,069 15,459 Stock-based expenses 33,757 17,451 12,158 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 2,477,622 $ 1,855,173 $ 1,360,943 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP operating profit 2013 2012 2011 GAAP income (loss) from operations $ (110,710 ) $ (35,085 ) $ 97,497 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 88,171 67,319 19,668 Stock-based expenses 379,350 229,258 120,429 Non-GAAP income from operations $ 356,811 $ 261,492 $ 237,594 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP net income attributable to salesforce.com 2013 2012 2011 GAAP net income (loss) attributable to salesforce.com $ (270,445 ) $ (11,572 ) $ 64,474 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 88,171 67,319 $ 19,668 Stock-based expenses 379,350 229,258 120,429 Amortization of debt discount, net 23,837 12,335 19,079 One-time tax items 149,147 0 0 Less: Income tax effect of Non-GAAP items (127,518 ) (103,730 ) (57,544 ) Non-GAAP net income attributable to salesforce.com $ 242,542 $ 193,610 $ 166,106 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(a) 2013 2012 2011 GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (1.92 ) $ (0.09 ) $ 0.47 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.59 0.47 0.14 Stock-based expenses 2.54 1.62 0.88 Amortization of debt discount, net 0.16 0.09 0.14 One-time tax items 1.00 0.00 0.00 Less: Income tax effect of Non-GAAP items (0.74 ) (0.73 ) (0.41 ) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to salesforce.com $ 1.63 $ 1.36 $ 1.22 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 149,070 142,295 136,598 (a) Reported GAAP loss per share was calculated using the basic share count.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion at January 31, 2013. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2013 could result in a $16.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. 56 Table of Contents At January 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $12.1 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the “Notes”). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. For the three months ended January 31, 2013 the Notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2013 and will remain classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $521.3 million as of January 31, 2013. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2013. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2013 was $1,178.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, which was $205.00. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of these investments in privately-held companies was $46.8 million and $48.3 million, respectively. 57 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:32:56.633826

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions. We were founded on the concept of delivering customer relationship management, or CRM, applications via the Internet, or “cloud.” We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000 and we have expanded our offerings with new editions, solutions and enhanced features, through internal development and acquisitions. We sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide on a subscription basis. Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into “customer companies” by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. Our objective is to deliver solutions to help companies transform the way they sell, service, market and innovate. With our four core services—Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and the Salesforce1 Platform—customers have the tools they need to build a next generation social front office with our social and mobile cloud technologies. Key elements of our strategy include: • strengthening our market-leading solutions; • extending distribution into high-growth markets; • expanding relationships with our existing customer base; • pursuing new customers; • reducing our attrition rates; • building our business in top markets globally, which includes building partnerships that help us add customers; and • encouraging the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platforms. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a Social Enterprise License Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities, continuing to develop our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the development of new services, the integration of acquired technologies, the expansion of our Salesforce1 ExactTarget Marketing Cloud and Salesforce1 Platform service offerings and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. As a result of our aggressive growth plans, specifically our hiring plan and acquisition activities, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles which have resulted in net losses on a GAAP basis. As we continue with our growth plan, we may continue to have net losses on a GAAP basis. Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts are available for renewal. We calculate our attrition rates as of the end of each reporting period. We do not calculate the attrition rate for ExactTarget, Inc. (“ExactTarget”). Our attrition rate was in the high-single digit percentage range as of January 31, 2014, declining from the low-double digit percentage range attrition rate as of January 31, 2013. We expect our attrition rates to continue to decline slowly over time, as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and other related programs. The majority of our subscription and support revenues are derived from subscriptions to our Sales Cloud. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 53 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014 and 53 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying customers, and build greater brand awareness. On March 18, 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the debt, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions that cover the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. The note hedge transactions are designed, but not guaranteed, to reduce or eliminate the potential economic dilution arising upon conversion. On March 20, 2013, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 400.0 million to 1.6 billion in order to provide for a four-for-one stock split of the common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend. The record date for the stock split was April 3, 2013, and the additional shares were distributed on April 17, 2013. Each stockholder of record on the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. All share and per share data presented herein reflect the impact of the increase in authorized shares and the stock split, as appropriate. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. On July 11, 2013, we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a $300.0 million term loan due on July 11, 2016. All amounts borrowed under the term loan were used to pay a portion of the total purchase price for ExactTarget. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On July 12, 2013, we acquired for cash the outstanding stock of ExactTarget, a leading global provider of cross-channel, digital marketing solutions. We acquired ExactTarget for the assembled workforce, expected synergies and to create a world-class marketing platform across the channels of email, social, mobile and the web. The financial results of ExactTarget are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The total purchase price for ExactTarget was approximately $2.6 billion. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2014, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2014. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2014. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a “subscription” as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer-authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a “subscriber.” The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Revenue Recognition” below. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either annual or quarterly cycles. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi-year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. We typically issue renewal invoices in 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. This may result in an increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. Year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Approximately 74 percent of all subscription and support invoices were issued with annual terms during fiscal 2014. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: (in thousands) April 30,2013 July 31,2013 October 31,2013 January 31,2014 Fiscal 2014 Accounts receivable, net $ 502,609 $ 599,543 $ 604,045 $ 1,360,837 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,733,160 1,789,648 1,734,619 2,522,115 (in thousands) April 30,2012 July 31,2012 October 31,2012 January 31,2013 Fiscal 2013 Accounts receivable, net $ 371,395 $ 446,917 $ 418,590 $ 872,634 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 1,334,716 1,337,184 1,291,703 1,862,995 (in thousands) April 30,2011 July 31,2011 October 31,2011 January 31,2012 Fiscal 2012 Accounts receivable, net $ 270,816 $ 342,397 $ 312,331 $ 683,745 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 915,133 935,266 917,821 1,380,295 Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014 and approximately $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013. Also as a result, our typical contract length has grown and is now between 12 and 36 months. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year-to-year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. Unbilled deferred revenue does not include minimum revenue commitments from indirect sales channels, as we recognize revenue, deferred revenue, and any unbilled deferred revenue upon sell-through to an end user customer. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we have invested in additional database software and we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. The timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, Dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Stock-Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. We recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. During fiscal 2014, we recognized stock-based expense of $503.3 million. As of January 31, 2014, the aggregate stock compensation remaining to be amortized to costs and expenses over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years was $1.4 billion. We expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $596.3 million during fiscal 2015; $425.9 million during fiscal 2016; $251.0 million during fiscal 2017 and $100.2 million during fiscal 2018. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2014 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees in future periods. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from Business Combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: • there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; • the service has been or is being provided to the customer; • the collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and • the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple-Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple-deliverables that generally include multiple subscriptions, premium support, and professional services. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple-deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Multiple-deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting and the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence (“TPE”) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go-to-market strategy. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our customers, which are typically 12 to 36 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2014, we deferred $265.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $194.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $232.6 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $154.8 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $324.9 million at January 31, 2014 and $254.4 million at January 31, 2013. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of acquired companies. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, historical and projected customer retention rates, anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customers and acquired technology, and the expected use of the acquired assets. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible assets. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense. The value of our goodwill and intangible assets could be impacted by future adverse changes such as, but not limited to: a substantial decline in our market capitalization; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; and unanticipated competition. We evaluate and test the recoverability of our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more often if and when circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to: • future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; • the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationship, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings; 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and • discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Stock-Based Options and Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option or award which is the vesting term of generally four years for stock options and restricted stock awards and one year for shares issued pursuant to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The fair value of each option or ESPP share or stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change. Inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model include: • The estimated life for the stock options which is estimated based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for shares issued pursuant to our ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the 12 month offering period; • The risk free interest rate which is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights; • The future stock price volatility which is estimated considering both our observed option-implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights; and • The probability of performance conditions that effect the vesting of certain awards being achieved. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest. Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. At each of the interim financial reporting periods, we compute our tax provision by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year to date ordinary income and adjust the provision for discrete tax items recorded in the same period. The estimated annual effective tax rate at each interim period represents the best estimate based on evaluations of possible future transactions and may be subject to subsequent refinement or revision. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. Our tax provision could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, changes in tax laws including fundamental changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals that may be considered by the United States and many countries in the European Union, changes in accounting principles, adverse results of tax examinations as well as changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based compensation that are allocated directly to stockholders’ equity. Strategic Investments. We report our investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately-held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred. Management evaluates financial results, earnings trends, technology milestones and subsequent financing of these companies, as well as the general market conditions to identify indicators of other-than-temporary impairment.

As of January 31, (in thousands) 2014 2013 Balance Sheet Data: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,321,017 $ 1,758,285 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 2,522,115 1,862,995 Principal due on convertible senior notes and term loan 2,003,864 574,890 Unbilled deferred revenue was approximately $4.5 billion as of January 31, 2014 and $3.5 billion as of January 31, 2013. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2014 and 2013 Revenues. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, Variance (in thousands) 2014 2013 Dollars Percent Subscription and support $ 3,824,542 $ 2,868,808 $ 955,734 33 % Professional services and other 246,461 181,387 65,074 36 % Total revenues $ 4,071,003 $ 3,050,195 $ 1,020,808 33 % Total revenues were $4.1 billion for fiscal 2014, compared to $3.1 billion during the same period a year ago, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 33 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $3.8 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $955.7 million, or 33 percent. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due almost entirely to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in attrition rates as compared to a year ago. We have continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped reduce our attrition rates. The net price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, varies from period to period, but has remained within a consistent range over the past eight quarters. The net price per user per month has not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. Professional services and other revenues were $246.5 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.1 million, or 36 percent. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $1,171.2 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $244.7 million, or 26 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our service internationally and reduced attrition rates. However, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies caused a decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of decreasing our aggregate revenues by $24.4 million compared to the same period a year ago. Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Subscription and support $ 711,880 $ 494,187 $ 217,693 Professional services and other 256,548 189,392 67,156 Total cost of revenues $ 968,428 $ 683,579 $ 284,849 Percent of total revenues 24 % 22 % Cost of revenues was $968.4 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $683.6 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $284.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $102.8 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $48.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $80.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $32.1 million of which related to the amortization of acquired developed technology, an increase of $16.1 million in subcontractor and professional services expense, an increase of $23.1 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $11.9 million in stock-based expenses. We have increased our customer support and professional services headcount by 58 percent since January 31, 2013 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which the majority was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to cost of revenues which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Research and development $ 623,798 $ 429,479 $ 194,319 Percent of total revenues 15 % 14 % Research and development expenses were $623.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $429.5 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $194.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $114.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $31.1 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $16.0 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $17.2 million in allocated overhead and an increase of $14.8 million in test data lab costs. We increased our research and development headcount by 31 percent since January 31, 2013 in 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. In June 2013, we entered into a large capital lease agreement for software for a period of nine years, which consists of the contractual term of six years and a renewal option of three years. A portion of the depreciation expense on this asset was allocated to research and development which is included in the amount above. We expect the costs associated with this software agreement to increase in future fiscal years. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies. Marketing and Sales. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Marketing and sales $ 2,168,132 $ 1,614,026 $ 554,106 Percent of total revenues 53 % 53 % Marketing and sales expenses were $2.2 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $1.6 billion, or 53 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $554.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $357.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $59.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $57.2 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and an increase of $49.8 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 33 percent since January 31, 2013. The increase in headcount was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, while a portion of the increase was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. General and Administrative. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 General and administrative $ 596,719 $ 433,821 $ 162,898 Percent of total revenues 15 % 15 % General and administrative expenses were $596.7 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2014, compared to $433.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $162.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $70.6 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $21.7 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $48.3 million in professional and outside services, which included transaction fees associated with the ExactTarget acquisition, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 28 percent since January 31, 2013 as we added personnel to support our growth. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of ExactTarget. Loss from operations. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Loss from operations $ (286,074 ) $ (110,710 ) $ (175,364 ) Percent of total revenues (7 )% (4 )% Loss from operations for fiscal 2014, was $286.1 million and included $503.3 million of stock-based expenses and $146.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During the same period a year ago, operating loss was $110.7 million and included $379.4 million of stock-based expenses and $88.2 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investment income.

Investment income was $10.2 million for fiscal 2014, and was $19.6 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in marketable securities balances. Interest expense. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Interest expense $ (77,211 ) $ (30,948 ) $ (46,263 ) Percent of total revenues (2 )% (1 )% Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, term loan and capital leases. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $77.2 million for fiscal 2014 and was $30.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the March 2013 issuance of $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes, the $300.0 million term loan that was entered into in connection with the acquisition of ExactTarget and the large capital lease agreement for software which we entered into in June 2013. Benefit from (provision for) Income Taxes. Fiscal Year EndedJanuary 31, VarianceDollars (in thousands) 2014 2013 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $ 125,760 $ (142,651 ) $ 268,411 Effective tax rate 35 % (112 )% We reported a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and as a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in the previous year and recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014. We recorded a tax provision of $142.7 million on a pretax loss of $127.8 million, which resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 112 percent for fiscal 2013. Our effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in each of the applicable jurisdictions going forward and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly. Due to the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate could be volatile and is therefore difficult to forecast in future periods. See Note 8 “Income Taxes” to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.9 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, have helped improve our renewal rates. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2013 has generally remained consistent relative to prior periods. Professional services and other revenues were $181.4 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $926.5 million, or 30 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2013, compared to $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, an increase of $200.2 million, or 28 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates as a result of the reasons stated above. Revenues outside of the Americas increased despite an overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major international currencies, which reduced aggregate international revenues by $43.9 million compared to fiscal 2012.

The increase 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $77.5 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $16.3 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $36.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $37.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $17.2 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets and an increase of $14.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased customer support and professional services headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2012 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $305.9 million in employee-related costs, including amortization of deferred commissions, $83.6 million in stock-based expenses, $29.3 million in advertising, marketing and event costs and $23.7 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since January 31, 2012 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

During fiscal 2013, we capitalized $2.4 million of interest costs related to capital projects. Capitalized interest during fiscal 2012 was $14.6 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we suspended pre-construction activity, which includes capitalized interest costs, on the undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California resulting in an increase in interest expense as compared to fiscal 2012. Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.

The effective tax rate substantially differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to the tax charge of $186.8 million to establish a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In our evaluation, we considered our cumulative loss in recent years and our forecasted future losses as significant pieces of negative evidence. During fiscal 2013, we determined that the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence and a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets was established that resulted in a tax expense of $186.8 million. We recorded a tax benefit of $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 65 percent. The effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to federal and California tax credits and the impact of the Radian6 acquisition. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by foreign tax expense and non-deductible amounts. The effect on the tax rate was magnified because of the relatively small pre-tax loss. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2014, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion and accounts receivable of $1.4 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $875.5 million during fiscal 2014 and $736.9 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, and the expense associated with stock-based awards; the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; and changes in working capital accounts. Our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivables and prepaid assets and other current assets. Claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and our convertible notes. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services and the subsequent collection of those billings. As described above in “Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable,” our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. We generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual or quarterly installments. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. Such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and deferred revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheet. The operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2014 increased $138.6 million over the same period a year ago primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. During fiscal 2014, $8.1 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans was reclassified to cash flows from financing activities, as compared to $14.9 million during the same period a year ago. The increase in net cash in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by certain unfavorable changes in working capital accounts, primarily an increase in accounts receivables and a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and other liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by approximately $30.0 million of payments made for the transaction fees incurred by ExactTarget and us related to the acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.4 billion during fiscal 2014 and $938.9 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2014 primarily related to the acquisition of EdgeSpring, Inc. (“EdgeSpring”) in June 2013, the acquisition of ExactTarget in July 2013, capital expenditures, including new office build-outs and a new intellectual property licensing agreement, investment of cash balances and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.6 billion during fiscal 2014 and $334.5 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2014 consisted primarily of $1.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, $84.8 million from proceeds from the issuance of warrants, $298.5 million of proceeds from the term loan, net of loan fees, and $289.9 million from proceeds from employee-related equity plans offset by $153.8 million for the purchase of hedges on the convertible note, $41.1 million of principal payments on capital leases and $15.0 million of principal payments on the term loan. In July 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provides for a $300.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) that matures on July 11, 2016 (the “Maturity Date”). The Term Loan bears interest at our option under either a LIBOR-based formula or a base rate formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock or pay dividends, and certain other restrictions on our activities as defined in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. As of January 31 2014, the amount outstanding under the Term Loan was $285.0 million. Accrued interest on the Term Loan was $0.5 million as of January 31, 2014. During fiscal 2014, payments totaling $15.0 million were made on the Term Loan and subsequent payments of $7.5 million are due quarterly thereafter until the maturity date in July 2016 when the remaining outstanding principal amount is due. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the “0.75% Senior Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “0.75% Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “0.75% Warrants”). The 0.75% Senior Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.75% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.75% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2013, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes were convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending January 31, 2014. For the 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2014, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $21.34 per share applicable to the 0.75% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.75% Senior Notes are convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2014. As the 0.75% Senior Notes are due on January 15, 2015, they are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. During the quarter ending April 30, 2014, we will repay in cash an aggregate principal balance of at least $280.0 million related to conversion requests of our 0.75% Senior Notes received through the date of the filing of 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements this Form 10-K. The excess of the conversion value that is greater than the principal amount will be delivered in shares of our common stock for the majority of the conversion requests received to date. If our stock price continues to exceed the conversion price of our 0.75% Senior Notes, we may continue to see conversion requests on the 0.75% Senior Notes during fiscal 2015. In March 2013, we issued $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes due April 1, 2018 (the “0.25% Senior Notes”) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the “0.25% Note Hedges”) and separate warrant transactions (the “0.25% Warrants”). The 0.25% Senior Notes will mature on April 1, 2018, unless earlier converted. Upon conversion of any 0.25% Senior Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the 0.25% Senior Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. The 0.25% Senior Notes will be convertible if during any 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days of any fiscal quarter commencing after April 30, 2013, our common stock trades at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. The 0.25% Senior Notes have not yet been convertible at the holders’ option. The 0.25% Senior Notes are classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2014. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2014, our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes. Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes will not be convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending April 30, 2014, and will remain classified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and other obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, government obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2014, we have a total of $55.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through December 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co-location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2014, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 606,505 $ 77,455 $ 146,038 $ 183,012 $ 200,000 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 1,280,872 144,568 300,105 248,671 587,528 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 102,208 51,946 50,173 89 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 1,733,842 573,875 5,750 1,154,217 0 Term loan 285,000 30,000 255,000 0 0 Financing obligation 335,824 0 18,654 42,658 274,512 Contractual commitments 5,950 5,950 0 0 0 $ 4,350,201 $ 883,794 $ 775,720 $ 1,628,647 $ 1,062,040 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. The Financing Obligation above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space in San Francisco, California. As of January 31, 2014, $40.2 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to Financing obligation, building in progress—leased facility, which is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2014 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations and increase productivity. We plan to upgrade and/or replace various internal systems to scale with the overall growth of the Company. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S-K Item 10(e), “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,” defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP operating profit and Non-GAAP net income We use the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non-cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. In addition to our GAAP measures we use these non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses and benefits. These items are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long-term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non-GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non-cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non-cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Additionally, as significant, unusual or discrete events occur, the results may be excluded in the period in which the events occur. • Stock-Based Expenses. The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. • Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company’s $575.0 million of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010 and the Company’s $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in March 2013. The imputed interest rates were approximately 5.9% for the notes issued in January 2010 and approximately 2.5% for the notes issued in March 2013, while the coupon interest rates were 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non-cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operational performance. • Income Tax Effects and Adjustments. The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision excludes the tax effects of expense items described above and certain tax items not directly related to the current fiscal year’s ordinary operating results. Examples of such tax items include, but are not limited to, changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, certain acquisition-related costs and unusual or infrequently occurring items. Management believes the exclusion of these income tax adjustments provides investors with useful supplemental information about the Company’s operational performance. We define non-GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. We define non-GAAP operating profit as our non-GAAP gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock-based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles that are included in operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non-GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding items that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non-GAAP earnings per share as our non-GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non-GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of gross profit, operating profit, net income and earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP measure, “gross profit,” “loss from operations,” “net loss” and “Net loss per share” for the years ended January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands, except for share numbers): For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP gross profit 2014 2013 2012 GAAP gross profit $ 3,102,575 $ 2,366,616 $ 1,777,653 Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 109,356 77,249 60,069 Stock-based expenses 45,608 33,757 17,451 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 3,257,539 $ 2,477,622 $ 1,855,173 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP operating profit 2014 2013 2012 GAAP loss from operations $ (286,074 ) $ (110,710 ) $ (35,085 ) Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 146,535 88,171 67,319 Stock-based expenses 503,280 379,350 229,258 Non-GAAP operating profit $ 363,741 $ 356,811 $ 261,492 For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP net income 2014 2013 2012 GAAP net loss $ (232,175 ) $ (270,445 ) $ (11,572 ) Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 146,535 88,171 67,319 Stock-based expenses 503,280 379,350 229,258 Amortization of debt discount, net 46,942 23,837 12,335 Less: Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (242,729 ) 21,629 (103,730 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 221,853 $ 242,542 $ 193,610 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For the Year Ended January 31, Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share(a) 2014 2013 2012 GAAP diluted loss per share $ (0.39 ) $ (0.48 ) $ (0.02 ) Plus: Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.23 0.15 0.12 Stock-based expenses 0.79 0.64 0.40 Amortization of debt discount, net 0.07 0.04 0.02 Less: Income tax effects and adjustments of Non-GAAP items (0.35 ) 0.06 (0.18 ) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.35 $ 0.41 $ 0.34 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share 635,688 596,280 569,180 (a) Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split of our common stock through a stock dividend which occurred in April 2013. The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the years ended January 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 because we had a net loss for those periods and the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.3 billion at January 31, 2014. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least triple BBB or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities are held for general corporate purposes including possible acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses, services or technologies, working capital and capital expenditures. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Our fixed-income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100-basis points at January 31, 2014 could result in a $8.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2013, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.8 billion. The fixed-income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100-basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $16.7 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the “0.75% Senior Notes”) and in March 2013, we issued at par value $1.15 billion of 0.25% convertible senior notes (the “0.25% Senior Notes”) (collectively the “Notes”). Holders may convert the Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amounts of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amounts of the Notes, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. The 0.75% Senior Notes and the 0.25% Senior Notes have fixed annual interest rates of 0.75% and 0.25%, respectively and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair values of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair values of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our 0.75% Senior Notes was $542.2 million and the carrying value of our 0.25% Senior Notes was $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2014, which represents the liability components of the $568.9 million principal balance and $1.15 billion principal balance, respectively. The total estimated fair values of our 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes at January 31, 2014 were $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the 0.75% Senior Notes and 0.25% Senior Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, which were $283.78 and $115.29, respectively. In July 2013, we entered into a $300.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) which matures in July 2016 and bears interest at our option of either a base rate plus a spread of 0.50% to 1.00% or an adjusted LIBOR rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus a spread of 1.50% to 2.00%. The Company entered into the Term Loan for purposes of partially funding the acquisition of ExactTarget. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for the loan bearing interest as described above at the end of an interest period. The Term Loan is payable in quarterly installments equal to $7.5 million beginning in September 2013, with the remaining outstanding principal amount of the term loan being due and payable at maturity. By entering into the Term Loan, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon a variable base rate or LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate on the Term Loan was 2.0% for fiscal 2014. Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately-held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non-marketable equity and debt securities of the privately-held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2014 and January 31, 2013 the fair value of our investments in privately-held companies was $77.0 million and $46.8 million, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 17:33:00.010733
